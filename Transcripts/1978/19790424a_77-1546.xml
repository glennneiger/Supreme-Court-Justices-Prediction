            <text syncTime="75.375" offset="404877">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.200" offset="424208">This is a case on writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.102" offset="471751">This case and Colby v. Driver set an argument in tandem.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.753" offset="494425">Both involve the question, “did Congress intend in the enactment of the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962 to grant United States District Courts nationwide personal jurisdiction over federal officers and employees in their private individual capacities, that is in essence, against them for acts allegedly performed under color of law?”</text>
            <text syncTime="132.775" offset="634441">This is a civil rights tort action brought in the District of Columbia alleging unconstitutional acts and seeking money damages from the pocketbooks of four individuals who were and are federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.785" offset="726497">All wrongful acts, alleged, took place in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.064" offset="755649">The defendants below are petitioner Stafford, a United States attorney in the Northern District of Florida, now United States District Judge in the Northern District of Florida, petitioner Carrouth, an Assistant United States Attorney in the Northern District of Florida, now in private practice in Florida, Meadow, a federal FBI agent stationed then and now in the Northern District of Florida, and Goodwin, a trial attorney with the United States Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.970" offset="927222">Plaintiffs are 10 individuals called to testify before a grand jury in Tallahassee, Florida in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.192" offset="972152">A majority of the plaintiffs reside in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.267" offset="996394">None of the plaintiffs reside in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.365" offset="1016874">Eight of the plaintiffs were indicted in Florida for conspiracy to riot.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.310" offset="1048639">After trial, each was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.135" offset="1063894">They became known in the press as the Gainesville Eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.749" offset="1082389">Goodwin, who is not a petitioner here, was the prosecutor appointed as special attorney to act in Florida in connection with this investigation in Florida and the trial in Florida, out of which, this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.911" offset="1158980">Now, the complaint below alleges, and there has been no trial on this issue, the complaint alleges that Goodwin lied when examined in a course of the grand jury proceedings by the presiding judge in connection with the presence of government informants in the -- among the subpoenaed witnesses in connection with this investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.177" offset="1276113">Now, the complaint alleges that the petitioners knew and remained silent with regard to this alleged perjury and this constituted a conspiracy against the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.682" offset="1354062">Plaintiffs here asked damages of 1.5 million out of the pockets of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.526" offset="1389484">They also asked for some declaratory rights and seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to bring indictments against petitioners and Goodwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.211" offset="1440266">The petitioners, having no affiliation with the District of Columbia, moved to dismiss insufficiency of jur-- personal jurisdiction, insufficiency as a process, improper venue, and ultimately for a transfer of venue to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.138" offset="1547891">The District Court judge denied the transfer of the case to Florida, but granted the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.532" offset="1581537">The Circuit Court disag -- Columbia Circuit Court reversed and denied rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.056" offset="1615600">It held that the petitioners were subject to the District of Columbia Court solely because of the use by the plaintiffs of the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962, more precisely, 1391 (e).</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="401.884" offset="1710895">When you say 1391 (e) is more precisely the Mandamus and Venue Act, actually, the Mandamus and Venue Act incorp -- in the statutes at large appears as two sections, doesn't it; one creating Section 1361 and the other creating Section 1391 (e)?</text>

            <text syncTime="420.932" offset="1787068">Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that's quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.898" offset="1802951">The Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962 is comprised of 19 -- of 1361 which grants the Mandamus Writ to the District Courts and, as an adjunct and to be read with it and as a part of it is Section 2 which is 1391 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="446.826" offset="1890722">And, the legislative intent was that Section 2 would have as its purpose the same purpose as the first section.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.828" offset="1946728">They were to re -- be read together and Judge Friendly in Natural Resources against TVA said they must be read together, the statute as a whole, and it's absolutely correct.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="471.121" offset="1987897">Well, but when you say “the legislative intent was,” it's a little bit hard to get your version of the legislative intent out of the language of 1391 (e)?</text>

            <text syncTime="482.497" offset="2033351">Well, 1391 (e) is cast in terms of Mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.624" offset="2069817">It provides an officer who is, it provides who is acting, is acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.174" offset="2112031">It doesn't say who was acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.970" offset="2127287">It deals with ongoing present conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.938" offset="2155081">It isn't a model of clarity, Your Honor, but it does have language in it that has the cast of Mandamus and was intended so by the Congress in promulgating it, I submit.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.620" offset="2217880">Except, in the Act, the-- in one section, they used the word “mandamus” in 1361 and, in 1391 (e), they use the word “a civil action.”</text>

            <text syncTime="548.280" offset="2296456">It is cast in terms of Mandamus and the -- and mandamus, in promulgating it, they stated that it would be read with the same purpose as Mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.369" offset="2368867">And, the whole history -- both the purpose and the history indicates that they were meant to be read together and, if read together, they become into perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.786" offset="2430516">The -- our petition was granted on January 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.066" offset="2459669">At the same time, the Colby v. Driver petition, a petition that I also filed, was to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was granted, raising for review the same statutory issues involving venue and jurisdiction and to avoid duplication with the tandem case.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.859" offset="2554859">And with the permission of the Court, I will make the thrust of my very brief argument, one point common to both cases and that is that the statutes simply does not apply to respondents' suit against federal officers and employees' pocketbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.233" offset="2636257">My partner, Mr. Nemser, in the second case will focus on the due process point.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.905" offset="2663006">Now, basically, if Your Honors please, it is the language, the purpose and the history of the statute involved here that demonstrate that Congress did not intend its application to suits for money judgments against federal officers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.589" offset="2753703">When the statute is read in its full context with realization of its purpose, a narrow limited purpose, and in the light of its legislative history, it becomes clear that Congress did not direct or intend coverage of personal tort damage actions as a kind of the suit brought below.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.797" offset="2854536">As a matter of fact, the suit that is brought below by respondents didn't exist in 1962 and it wasn't established this Bevins type action until nine years later in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.824" offset="2930709">Now, respondents in the Court below misinterpret the language, purpose, and history of the statue as an unprecedented break with the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.646" offset="2973968">In proper perspective, the statute is not a sweeping general expansion of venue and jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.492" offset="3009390">Their interpretation which was embraced by the Court below would allow federal employees to become virtual shuttlecocks to be hit repeatedly in personal damage suits in scattered forms throughout the country so long as the acts complained of were alleged to have been performed under color of legal authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.368" offset="3208861">Well, those come to mind what Your Honor has mentioned, but in cases that I've been familiar with where 1391 has been used and it's been used at least 17 times, as we put in our appendix, once you're hit with a 1391 (e), you are going to be in pain and suffering and in danger of ultimate difficulties for a long time before you can extricate yourself even on a motion for summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.547" offset="3441560">He is sued twice there, not on the same fact situation, but he's sort of a target because he's a government prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.241" offset="3468309">And, in those cases, the long arm statute was declared by the District Court judge not to be applicable because there wasn't enough evidence to, at the threshold, to give jurisdiction on the long arm statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.896" offset="3522957">But Judge Hate in the Southern District of New York held that 1391 (e), without such evidence, was sufficient and he is held there in those cases because of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.303" offset="3824619">It's a different kind of a suit, so that, it can be difficult where you're hit repeatedly with an easy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.133" offset="3867878">Now, the tradition has always been that defendants, whether they are government officials or not, that they're sued where they're -- they live, where they're found and that's true of all of us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1333.499" offset="5437419">And, I think with hindsight, that that was present, but the cases have determined that it is limited to these kind of cases, mandamus type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.384" offset="5492903">And, I think it's interesting that in 1976, the only time I know that Congress reviewed the Mandamus and Venue Act, that, there, it stated in the hearings and the reports that it was limited to mandamus type actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.796" offset="5570539">It said that, limited to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.711" offset="5586213">Now, the Second Circuit has also had occasion to review 1391 (e), and Judge Friendly, in Natural Resources and TVA, found that TVA and its officials in an injunction action was not within the ambit of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.742" offset="5690389">He -- Judge Friendly said that the -- this particular statute was not the kind of a text that could be parsed with the aid of a grammar and dictionary, but rather, what should be looked to was what was the mischief it tried to cure and what it was trying to cure here was to allow judicial review actions, mandamus type actions, in the District Courts outside the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.658" offset="5826017">Now, the -- this action brought by the respondents could not have been brought in the District of Columbia and was not in any way restricted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.234" offset="6000306">In the context, it is clear that the problem related to providing judicial review actions of eliminating the problem of indispensible partings of allowing venue where there were actions against officials in the -- in connection with their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.860" offset="6106781">There were no personal jurisdiction problems and there were no problems of any kind in connection with a tort action against an official.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.705" offset="6194239">They weren't established until 1971, but actions against public officials for wrongdoing to a citizen were sueable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.287" offset="13764524">I -- there was a series of events in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.946" offset="13787199">Five crucial events, which are all set forth in our brief and which I do not have time to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.546" offset="13813530">There's the first letter from the Department of Justice making Congress aware of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.720" offset="13834219">There were the hearings in which damage actions were extensively discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.619" offset="13849893">They were very concerned about damage actions because Barr v. Matteo had just come down and though it talked about a scope of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.503" offset="13881344">It talked about also the outer perimeters of it and they knew that there could be such suits beyond the perimeters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.264" offset="13912377">And, also -- then there was a redrafted Bill in which they added the very language which they were warned about, the “under color of law” language, and they put in the House report that their problem arises in damage actions seeking damages from him, from the government official, not from the government, but from him for actions which are claimed to be beyond the scope of the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.167" offset="14008090">Then, there was the second Department of Justice letter from then Deputy Attorney General Byron White and the Senate report which put in again that paragraph about seeking damages from him, from the government official, and then we got the Department of Justice acknowledgment that damage actions were covered, written by the then Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach who also advised the President to issue that statement so as to be sure that the powers of the Cabinet were not interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.873" offset="14182902">We will not have time to deal with the issue as to personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.326" offset="14216652">On that issue, I'd just like to say, very briefly, that we got personal jurisdiction by a combination of two things, Rule 4 (f) which permits service beyond the territorial limits of a state when a statute so authorizes it, and 1391 (e) is the statute which authorized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.319" offset="14284675">And, we also will not deal with the petitioners' due process claims, but I just want to say on that that the government has conceded that the Court below was right on this issue and petitioners have conceded that this Court's decisions in the International Shoe Co. line of cases do not apply to the extraterrito -- those cases which deal with the extraterritorial assertion of powers by states beyond its borders are not applicable here where Congress is using its power within the continental limits of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.414" offset="14477040">Congress has legislated to allow service of process on a nationwide basis as is done in other statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3947.170" offset="15892041">I just want to pick up for a minute since we are talking about, really, the same issues on what Mrs. Peterson just mentioned and she talked about that one sentence from the legislative history which Mr. Brown referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.944" offset="15947107">I don't want the Court to be misled by the sentence because the First Circuit was misled by it and the District Court was misled by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.327" offset="15976678">So, let's read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.024" offset="15983470">It says “the venue problem also arises in damage actions against federal officials.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.024" offset="16011473">What was the venue problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.442" offset="16021191">The venue problem was that certain suits were limited to the District of Columbia only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.383" offset="16052955">Right above that sentence, it says “the venue problem -- the problem of venue in actions against government officials arises when the action must be brought against the official in the District of Columbia,” and the report says “that venue problem also arises in suits against federal officials for damages.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.914" offset="16143026">So, to understand what Congress meant, we've got to say “think, where did that venue problem arise in suits against federal officials for damages?” Only in one type of damage action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.647" offset="16197987">That type of damage action which was in the nature of mandamus and which sought to compel payment of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.423" offset="16233096">This Court referred to 1391 (e) in South Carolina against Pat Katzenbach, I believe, and it said when you sue federal officials, you could now sue them outside of Washington, D.C and, in a footnote, it said “see Stroud against Benson.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.345" offset="16316792">Stroud against Benson was just that kind of damage action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.672" offset="16334033">It sought to compel a payment in the nature of mandamus from a federal official and that damage action was, at the time this Act was enacted, limited to Section 1391 (e).</text>

            <text syncTime="4672.084" offset="18791737">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.014" offset="18803440">At the outset, perhaps I should make clear, it doesn't go to the merits of the issue, but the United States is paying for private counsel for the petitioners in this case, but there is no guarantee that the United States will always do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.932" offset="18867075">In fact, there are some policy guidelines that the Department of Justice has issued that are -- can be found at 28 CFR 50.15 and, Section A (2) says “upon receipt of the agency's notification for request for counsel, the Civil Division will determine whether the employee's action is reasonably appear to have been performed within the scope of his employment and whether providing representation is in the interest of the United States, and these people have no guarantee that that determination is going to be made in their favor or that future Attorneys General will continue this policy or that Congress won't enact some law that would prevent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.081" offset="19035721">I'd like to begin with Schlanger because we believe that this Court has, in Schlanger, determined that the phrase “civil actions” in the statute does not shut us out on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.239" offset="19092355">In Schlanger, the Court did have certain important parts of the legislative history before it because, in footnote 4, it cites both the House report and the Senate report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.908" offset="19131016">I'm talking about House Report 536 and Senate Report 1692, and both of those compl -- contain this famous sentence we've all been discussing here about venue problems and suits for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.424" offset="19177096">And, the Senate report contains Deputy Attorney General White's letter that the Court below relied on and that respondents rely on, and that did not prevent this Court in Schlanger from saying, not respecting that habeas corpus could be considered a civil action, and it says it applies to civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.401" offset="19261001">We're not going to assume that Congress made this sweeping change in habeas corpus venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.193" offset="19288168">Now, with respect to the question, which I believe Mr. Justice Stewart said when Hammer Budge was mentioned, “isn't that just the genesis of this legislation and didn't the Congress actually enact the staten -- the statute later in 1962?</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.325" offset="19364655">Don't we have to look to the intent of Congress at that time?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.460" offset="19377194">I think the 1960 hearings and what Hammer Budge and his colleagues on that committee intended are very important because, for one thing, the famous sentence that we're talking about here appeared in the House report in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.914" offset="19431006">The first House report that was issued right after those hearings in that session of Congress, and that report evidently comes out of what the committee learned in the course of the hearings and determined in the course of the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.041" offset="19483564">If you go to the hearings, you will find in the transcripts of the hearings, you will find references to damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.406" offset="19504985">And, in the very early pages of the hearings, there are some sort of casual references to suits against a Congressman for slander and suits against a postman who slapped housewives while they're delivering the mail, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.830" offset="19566738">But, as the hearings draw to the close, after they've heard the testimony of Judge Albert Maris and the testimony of the Justice Department representative and have considered all the problems that they needed to deal with here, Congressman Budge said at the very close of the hearing “people keep coming back to these slander type actions,” this is page 2 --102 of the transcript, “people keep coming back to these slander type actions and that's not what I had in mind at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.933" offset="19675094">He says what he did have in mind was review of administrative action, that the person out in Idaho can get that review without coming to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.717" offset="19714278">And, when he spoke of his Idaho constituent who had this problem that he wanted to remedy by this Act, Congressman Budge said “this is a constituent who wants to sue the federal officer in charge out there and he can't sue the federal officer in charge out there because -- the reason he can't is if he tried to sue him in mandamus, of course only the District of Columbia had mandamus jurisdiction at that time and if the suit somehow escapes classification as a mandamus action, perhaps it's viewed simply as an injunctant, enjoining him from doing something, the federal official in charge out in Idaho could simply say “well, I'm carrying out the orders of my superior in Washington.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.097" offset="19883760">This would raise the indispensable party problem and the suit would be dismissed in Idaho.</text>

            <text syncTime="4962.321" offset="19952619">Exactly, and it's what happened in Stroud v. Benson also.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.295" offset="19964531">This Court's decision in Williams v. Fanning did not solve the problem. [Attempt to Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.404" offset="19988982">But, of course, if the citizen out in Idaho had wanted to sue that federal officer in damages, in the type of damage suit that ar -- had risen before this Act was passed, these were typically trespass actions, ejectment actions, false imprisonment, they were common law torts, nothing would keep him from suing him in the State Court of Idaho, in which the case might be removed to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.704" offset="20094203">In fact, many of the damage actions that respondents cite in their brief are brought -- were brought exactly this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.410" offset="20121057">US v. Lee that they cite was brought in the Circuit County Courts of Virginia and removed to the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.530" offset="20149478">So, that can't have been the problem that Representative Budge was concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.286" offset="20172466">Also in the hearings, despite these early references to slander type actions and slapping -- and postman slapping the housewives, Representative Doughty, who earlier had in a sort of moment of, I think, irritation at the Justice Department witness, said “well, maybe we want to cover all type of actions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.698" offset="20250206">But later on, Justice Doughty, being more fully advised, said “I don't have inconsideration that what we have in mind here is money damage type suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.057" offset="20291584">Now, the question then I think it's very clear from reading these hearings that what these congressmen intended was not the type of suit which the respondents have brought here or the type of damage suits that existed against the federal officials at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.892" offset="20346964">The question then is, did that intent carryover when Congress passed the Mandamus and Venue statute in 1962?</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.371" offset="20376848">Now, the House report in 1962 that contains that sentence that was in the earlier report is just sort of verbatim carried over from the earlier report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.753" offset="20418435">There's no evidence that somebody's thought down and -- sat down and thought about what that sentence meant anymore than they thought they carried over the report in toto.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.300" offset="20448528">I might say that the hearings throw some light on that sentence however because at page 87 of the transcript somebody brings up the question of money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.316" offset="20492622">Judge Maris is testifying at that point and he said “well, there are some old damage type actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.237" offset="20512371">There are suits against collectors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.026" offset="20519476">And he said, “you pretend you're suing the collector individually, but in fact, he has recoupment from the United States if he has just and reasonable cause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.956" offset="20551241">It's possible that the person who was directed to draw up this House report, wanting to make sure that he includes in the report everything that's come up in the hearings which Congress hasn't said -- which the congressmen haven't indicated that they didn't want to cover, saw that remark and said “the venue problem may arise sometimes in suits for damages.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5140.168" offset="20664090">Well, I think, Your Honor, that's an explanation for that sentence and it's an explanation for the sentence which suits our understanding of the statute, that it refers to damage type actions which, as Mr. Nemser said, are in essence against the United States and not the damage type actions which we have in this case, which don't imply a fiction and which are not, in essence, against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.953" offset="20755205">Now, turning to the phrase “under color of legal authority,” this also came up during the hearings and it was first raised by Committee Counsel Drabkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.195" offset="20796165">Later on, it was picked up by Representative Poff said, because they've been raising the pra -- the problem of, well, what do you do if the officers are named individually?</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.617" offset="20833886">And, Poff said “why don't we use this phrase” and Judge Maris, again, said “yes, use that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.495" offset="20857396">That's a good phrase because, let's get down to what we're really doing here, reviewing administrative action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.729" offset="20878294">If they included that phrase, they would also cover those actions in which you name the federal officer, pretended to be suing him individually, but what you were doing using the fiction of ex parte Young, the fiction which the Larson Court said was a way of getting around sovereign immunity, but you were still essentially reviewing action of the federal officer and not suing him for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.941" offset="20971186">You were going after equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.560" offset="20989576">And, as Mr. Nemser has pointed out, the phrase “under color of legal authority” is specifically explained in the later House report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.206" offset="21020191">They said what they meant by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.479" offset="21029282">What they meant by it is what we say it means, and we see no reason that the Court should adopt a contrary reading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.088" offset="21067734">Now, concerning Mr. Justice White's letter, the Court below and the respondents assume that that letter is essentially an ungranted request for a change in the statute with respect to damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.412" offset="21124995">I don't think that's a fair reading of the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.426" offset="21133040">The letter says there will be less confusion if you didn't use that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.071" offset="21155610">You could make it absolutely unmistakable that money damage suits against officers are not included, but the letter goes on to say “this, we assume, is in accord with the purpose of the Committee of the Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.736" offset="21218304">Now, I think, Mr. Justice White had the better of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.058" offset="21231574">It may be that the Congress kept the phrases in by pride of authorship or whatever other reason, and I think Mr. Justice White, then Deputy Attorney General White, probably had the better of the argument about what would've made the statute absolutely clear, but he was not -- you can't read that letter to mean that he was asking them to make a change, which they then refused to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.963" offset="21331257">Now, as to the memorandum by Attorney General Katzenbach, that's a memorandum which, of course, is not part of the legislative history because it went out after the statute had passed, went out under his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.118" offset="21383816">It was a seven-page memorandum that went out to the various offices of US attorneys, explaining the author of the memorandum's view of what the statute meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.981" offset="21423313">There's no blinking the fact that it says it covers liable and slander actions, and we think that it's wrong that the legislative history is powerful evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5396.553" offset="21689553">I think the Pre -- I think that indicates the understanding of the President and his advisers [Attempt to Laughter] that what he was signing was a Bill which extended to the District Courts, the jurisdiction hereto enjoyed solely by the District Court of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.395" offset="21764995">I think he assumes, as we say the reports read, that this Bill and the Venues -- including the Venue Section is only concerned with the types of suits which could formally have brought -- been brought only in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.950" offset="21831137">Now, something has also been said about the letter that Lawrence Walsh, Deputy Attorney Walsh, wrote to the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.460" offset="21865200">This was very early and I think you have to put that in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.290" offset="21884531">Deputy Attorney General Walsh had before him to comment on, at that time, the original Bill, HR10089, which spoke only to suing officers in their official capacity and did not extent mandamus jurisdiction, had no subject matter extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.701" offset="21942209">He just remarked on the Bill, “well, it looks to me as if this Bill won't do what you want it to do because it won't extend mandamus jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.518" offset="21973452">He also observed that it wouldn't cover the two types of suits which could then be brought against federal officers individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.347" offset="22000724">One of which, was damage suits, the other of which, were injunction suits where you're naming them individually to get around sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.977" offset="22027264">He said “I assume this is not the committee's concern.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.719" offset="22038235">Now, in fact, he was wrong about the second category, but he was right about the first category as the subsequent hearings and the explanation of the phrase “under color of legal authority” in all -- in the House report show.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.426" offset="22093093">So, to put a lot of weight on what he says in that letter, operating at the very beginning of the process or to interpret it as showing that, somehow, the government was arguing with them at that point and ask -- begging them not to include money damage suits I think would be -- would put in improper interpretation on that particular bit of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.753" offset="22186402">I think, in summing up, we submit that construing a federal statute such as this involves more than looking at its words and consulting a dictionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.740" offset="22222346">This Court has said in Schla -- has said in cases such as American Trucking Associations such as Train versus Colorado Public Interest Research Group, that it's not going to stop that language which, upon superficial examination, might tend to go in favor of one party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.294" offset="22296534">Each statute has a history in the Plain Meaning Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.710" offset="22306252">It's not a warrant for disregarding what that history tells us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.287" offset="22320567">We submit that what the history of 1391 (e) tells us, seen it in its entirety and not as a source of extractable fragments, is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.169" offset="22352018">Congress wanted to make it possible for the aggrieved citizen in Idaho to challenge actions of his government without going to the District of Columbia to do so.</text>
