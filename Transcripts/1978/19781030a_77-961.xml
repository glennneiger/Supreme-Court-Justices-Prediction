            <text syncTime="20.947" offset="187120">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.953" offset="203212">This case brings up for review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, reversing United States District Court for the Southern District, judgment, after a trial, nine-day trial, holding that the York State Statute granting unemployment compensation to strikers was unconstitutional, the reversal reinstated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.539" offset="325569">Under the statute, payments are made to strikers after seven weeks waiting period plus the one week required of all claimants for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.581" offset="381680">The cost of unemployment insurance or compensation is borne by the employer against whom the strikers called.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.043" offset="431522">After this trial, the District Court, and I'll briefly, very briefly sketch the outstanding holdings or findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.510" offset="477393">The statute, he held, was in direct and substantial conflict with the national policy of neutrality on the part of the Government in so far as economic contest are concerned in the field of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.274" offset="548446">He held that the state intervention, on behalf of strikers causing employers to finance strikes against themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.358" offset="588779">Therefore, he held that the law was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act as amended, under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.142" offset="627963">The substantial impact of New York's law on bargaining and strikes was evidenced if indeed it is itself evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.951" offset="671222">By documentary proof emanating in considerable measure from involved unions, those involved in the strike and major unions generally in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.879" offset="722840">From economic data, from expert opinion, and from employers' views, and perhaps most concretely it was evident or evidenced, from the fact that $49 million in unemployment compensation was paid out in the course of the particular strike which led up to this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.496" offset="829315">Now, the Second Circuit accepted the findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.412" offset="857004">They acknowledged the conflict, which the District Court found between the National Policy of Neutrality, and the state statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.031" offset="911548">Nevertheless, although they said in their words that a positive expression of congressional intent is lacking, nevertheless they said we will reverse because by resorting to inference, we find that Congress intended to tolerate this conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.908" offset="1023039">And that they saw this wholly area of payment to strikers as one inviting to state experimentation, on a state by state basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.007" offset="1099421">Uncertain and unambiguous legislative history, which we contend is all there is in this case, falls far short of the standard of clarity that's required to justify an invasion of the neutrality principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.151" offset="1267963">But in the case of a lock out, I don't -- I'm not aware of the same kind of statistics concerning impact, concerning frequency for example, strikes and lock outs are just not comparable in numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.544" offset="1329507">So, I would want to look into that question, because we in this case develop impact very thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.688" offset="1362108">But on principle, as I said at the opening of my answer, I think they would both have to be controlled by the same considerations.</text>

            <label>Mr. David D. Benetar</label>
            <text syncTime="344.281" offset="1480495">In a few ways, and what happened in this case sort of dramatizes the difference, because with 33,000 workers who collected unemployment compensation and 1,000 who applied for welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.475" offset="1549249">Now, the difference that I see, the differences are manifold.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.008" offset="1563355">Number one, unemployment insurance is fixed, certain, and promised.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.104" offset="1591777">You know that it's coming after a certain number of weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.056" offset="1607555">You know the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.481" offset="1617272">Number two, there is no needs test, because unemployment compensation wasn't intended in this origins.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.979" offset="1655306">People -- the Congress wasn't thinking in these origins about needs, except those created by the great depression, when people were looking for work and couldn't find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.781" offset="1698461">So, there was no -- there's no needs test and finally, if the Court pleases, welfare is not subsidized, paid for by the very employer against whom the strike is being called and maintained.</text>

            <label>Mr. David D. Benetar</label>
            <text syncTime="422.157" offset="1791979">Well, it may -- well, in our case, as Your Honor can see from the figures, the impacts of welfare and unemployment insurance were nowhere nearly equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.666" offset="1854046">The unemployment compensation far outweighed the impact of welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.229" offset="1880273">And I think that there's another aspect to this and that is that in the case of welfare, one would have to consider perhaps and weigh the interest of this state.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.936" offset="1935130">If it was out in out trying to protect welfare, not other the guise of unemployment insurance, but I do not see and I've never seen any proof to indicate impact to the extent that I have described to the Court in these few opening sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.074" offset="2007646">If there were such proof, perhaps the situation might be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.397" offset="2028962">But as far as I know and as far as I read the situation, they do stand on a different fitting -- footing welfare and unemployment compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.367" offset="2068877">Mr. Benetar, to distinguish welfare, what would you do if you had unemployment compensation financed by the state, $49 million paid by the state, instead of the employer?</text>

          <turn speaker="david_d_benetar" startTime="501.882" stopTime="503.044">

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="503.044" offset="2115584">If it was financed by the state for general revenues rather than by the employer, would your case be different?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_d_benetar" startTime="509.355" stopTime="702.308">
            <label>Mr. David D. Benetar</label>
            <text syncTime="509.355" offset="2140766">It would be different but not in any way basically ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.918" offset="2175039">It would be different because the direct subsidy by the employer involved, of course, underscores and emphasizes the extent of the invasion of the principle of neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.595" offset="2229791">You're not only helping the striker, but you're putting the burden on it -- of it on the man against whom the strike is being called.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.454" offset="2261138">So in my judgment, if the only thing that was present were the payout of $49 million, I would still say that under unemployment compensation statute, this was an unlawful and preempted statute and that the payment should not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.304" offset="2348596">Now, the -- in a way I've said in my answers, what I'm about to say now, but I think it's important, this case touches on the core of our national policy, this is no glancing blow.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.891" offset="2414947">It goes to the core of our national policy of neutrality, a policy leaving the resolution of economic disputes to the free play of economic forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.275" offset="2468446">Congress enacted this comprehensive policy because at this -- as this Court has said, because of the perceived inadequacy of the states to create a comprehensive and equitable way of dealing with the adjustments between parties to labor disputes, that was the genesis of this, to get a federal law that would wipe out the state differences and they were wide and varied.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.607" offset="2605850">And make this principle of neutrality, a principle across the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.931" offset="2639078">Now, as we see the precise question here then, it is this, can Congress reasonably be said to have intended by the Social Security Act, to invite the states to re-enter through the vehicle of unemployment compensation, the field that Congress had just preempted five or six weeks before in the National Labor Relations Act, that's the time relationship between the two acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.845" offset="2778781">And invite, did they intended then within five or six weeks invite the states to re-enter this preempted territory and substitute their several concepts of neutrality and of the balance of economic forces or power in place of the balance struck by Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="694.176" offset="2880031">That's what we see as the question in the case, and we think too a very considerable extent it answers itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.974" offset="3691290">I think that the Congress would have the right to change the concept of neutrality, but I don't think that they would, could or would do that without measuring the effect of so drastic and invasion of the forbidden area under one hand with the desire if there was one on New York's part to keep using unemployment compensation as a vehicle for paying out money, not on a basis of needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.133" offset="3839875">I just don't think that it would happen that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.818" offset="3858683">Now, a few words about the strike that led to this, before it was over or I should say this, that on July 14th of 1971, a CWA Communication Workers called a nationwide strike against the Bell System Companies who are bargaining with that at that time, including these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.309" offset="3972577">Four days later, an agreement was reached, the union recommended it to the members, urged ratification, and was ratified on the national basis, except in New York, where it was turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.285" offset="4028479">And New York went on strike and ultimately, the National Union sort of joined the strike in the sense that the New York authorities insisted on conducting it, so the National Union went along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.873" offset="4094830">Before the strike was over in New York, seven months had elapsed, $49 million as I've said were paid out to some 33,000 strikers, and the unemployment insurance account of Telephone Company alone was depleted by $40 million, which was required to replace and it's in the process of replacing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.101" offset="4187826">The employers were influenced to settle against their better judgment, this was all in the findings which were accepted on terms in New York, which broke the national pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.065" offset="4227636">They didn't want to do that but they felt that the strikers had several more weeks if not months of unemployment compensation coming and that there just wasn't any use in carrying the fight any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.909" offset="4279045">Contrasted with the $49 million paid out by the companies through vehicle of unemployment compensation was $14 million paid out of the union's strike fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.992" offset="4339336">Small wonder under those circumstances that we find the union leader who conducted this strike in New York, bulletenizing his members immediately after the strike was over and saying to them, the fact that we kept out 33 or whatever thousand people it was on strike for 280% of the membership for 218 days he says, that factor is an incredible phenomenon and it's due to three outstanding causes: 1) dedication and spirit of the strikers; 2) unemployment insurance; 3) the effectiveness of the CWA's strike fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.625" offset="4541837">And the strike fund rightfully took third place in view of what I've said to you about the comparative figures between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.573" offset="4585618">The union involved in the strike publicly referred to the strike as our strike weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.002" offset="4615398">They saw it very realistically that what this was, was a strike weapon, an economic weapon and that's what accounted for what they call the phenomenon of the 218-day hold out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.909" offset="4683003">Now, it should not be the -- suppose for a moment that this was an isolated instance, according to the New York Labor Department of Statistics, almost 10% of the strikes over a period of some 15 or 20 years, published statistics, almost 10% lasted eight weeks or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.180" offset="4792090">13.8% of all employees involved in strikes were involved in such lengthy strikes, and 51% of all man days made idle by these lengthy strikes or rather 51% all man days made idle in all strike were attributable to this lengthy, more than eight weeks strikes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.342" offset="6160697">Yes they did, yes they did but one can cite a case, but when you read Lodge '76, there is no way in my opinion of its supporting with the Second Circuit did, because the case reaffirms in the clearest terms that what I've said is true and that the catalyst relied on by Congress and by this Court as seen from the words of the act, the catalyst relied on is the unaided struggle between the parties leading one of them just say, "We've had enough", and the Government is not suppose to enter into that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.109" offset="6363826">In a presumption case such -- pre-emption case such as this, such as Lodge '76, the crucial inquiry is whether Congress intended this field to be unregulated because it was left to be uncontrolled -- to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.332" offset="6504678">Well, my view of it is that the area below was compounded by their recognition of the principle without giving an effect, that's my view of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.955" offset="6567163">I think what they did was to take a principle of great weight and then from these fragments of so-called legislative history, they drew an inference admitting that Congress had not spoken clearly on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.446" offset="6653158">They drew an inference that Congress intended to violate the very policy which they were quoting from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.728" offset="6690252">And I don't think that when you take inference from ambiguous, uncertain legislative history which points in two directions and you pitted against the centerpiece of the national scheme that you can come out with a result, which justifies the piercing with a violation or the invasion of the national scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.147" offset="6823999">Now, the proven effect of the New York statute, no doubt about it, acknowledged by the Second Circuit, that they acknowledged too that there is this conflict, is the proven effect is to order the balance of power between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.007" offset="6919398">Now, let's just briefly take a look at that history in an overall sense, because we brief the details of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.358" offset="6952835">The Court of Appeals as I've said acknowledged that there is no positive expression of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.026" offset="6979480">The First Circuit in Grinnell went through that whole list of items of congressional history, and reached the conclusion that it was not sufficiently clear to establish congressional intent, either way and prior to the Second Circuit's decision in this case, every other federal court that considered the matter reach the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.679" offset="7094105">And an inconclusive legislative record, we submit is not an adequate basis for permitting New York's interference with federal policy as found by the courts below and wherein a particularly tender area, as Professor Cox has said, where a state law is based on an accommodation of the special interest of employer's unions and employees in collective bargaining, the balance struck by Congress among those same interest requires exclusion, unless Congress has provided otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.558" offset="7249586">Well, Congress has not provided otherwise, and there is no reliable indication that it even intended to provide otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.966" offset="7291277">The recent decision of this Court in the Malone case stresses the question of clarity, how much clarity is really needed before one can say that a key tenet is a federal policy has been violated.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maria L. Marcus</label>
            <text syncTime="1827.422" offset="7413112">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.452" offset="7421158">I'm Maria L. Marcus, Special Assistant Attorney General representing respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.805" offset="7442578">Pre-emption is a doctrine designed to give effect to congressional intent not to overcome it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.763" offset="7466402">And as the unanimous decision of the Second Circuit in this case points out, the key to that intent is in the Social Security Act, not in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.038" offset="7507571">For the NLRA contains no specific direction, as to the extent to which states are permitted to regulate labor management controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.338" offset="7544769">Now, when Congress faces up to the pre-emption question, in enacting second law, this Court has looked to the more pertinent federal provision in disposing in pre-emption claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.674" offset="7594088">Most recent example of this was in Malone versus White Motor Corporation where the employer, like petitioners here, argued that the NLRA's policy of free collective bargaining was absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.165" offset="7640064">And that therefore, the state's statute there which actually altered the term of a collective bargaining agreement must violate the federal regulatory scheme and be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.659" offset="7686040">But, this Court upheld the state's right to act, pointing to the welfare of Pension Plans Disclosure Act as a better indicia of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.609" offset="7721775">Now, petitioners here say that this Court should simply on the basis of the general pre-emption principles derived from the NLRA hold that the state has no right to give unemployment benefits to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.923" offset="7775065">Now, Congress directly faced this question in enacting the Social Security Act and it decided that with three very narrow exceptions that the state was free to grant such benefits or to refuse to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.262" offset="7844446">Social Security Act received its impetus as this Court has recognized from the President's Committee on Economic Security, whose advisory counsel said, When you enact the Social Security Act, don't let the states pay unemployment benefits to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.205" offset="7920201">Senator Wagner, who was the sponsor of both NLRA and the Social Security Act and was also the first witness in the hearings on this Social Security Act, took a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.960" offset="7971192">He said, there should be practically no restrictions on the states, in the kind of programs that they can write.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.709" offset="8002226">Now, Congress ultimately did pass some restrictions, dealing with the payment of unemployment compensation during strikes, but aside from those restrictions, consciously left the rest to the states for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.990" offset="8067323">It was extremely important at that time that all the states pass unemployment compensation laws, because if they didn't, the purpose of the Social Security Act would have been frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.052" offset="8115597">And to make sure that all the states came into the field, Congress enacted extremely strong and elaborate incentives to induce the states to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.298" offset="8164603">The Senate Finance Committee report in explaining the approach of Congress passing the Social Security Act said that they wanted the states to proceed without dictation from Washington and they recognized New York, whose statute was already in existence and substantially the same form, as we have it today, as one of the kinds of laws that they sought to encourage the other states to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.371" offset="8276825">Now, as far as the experience rating aspect, which counsel has referred, which Mr. Justice Marshall asked about, the fact is that on the face of New York's law it was already indicated that New York was contemplating passing such a provision, and what's more important, Congress itself wanted all the states to have experience rating provisions and included incentives to persuade the states to put experience rating into all their law, so they wanted the states to proceed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.996" offset="8411408">The Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act were passed during the same five-week period, by the same Congress sitting in the same session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.722" offset="8462294">Now, there is no pre-emption, there is not a vestige of support in the legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act for any such pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.135" offset="8503881">The National Labor Relations Board choose the agency in charge of interpreting and enforcing the law, said that there is no pre-emption here, as does the United States of America, who has come in on the same brief, as amicus curiae in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.473" offset="8573262">The question of pre-emption is not as counsel has been indicating a constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.186" offset="8608162">This Court said in Retail Clerks versus Schermerhorn that pre-emption is merely a rationalization of the co-existence of federal and state agencies in the same labor relations field, it's not a constitutional principle at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.056" offset="8751626">Right, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, but this what this Court meant in stating, directly stating, and I'm quoting from the decision of that pre-emption is not a constitutional principle, it simply meant that the idea of not having the states in the field at all is not part of the pre-emption concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.434" offset="8817142">The pre-emption concept simply points to what Congress had in mind, Congress, the ultimate top stone of deciding whether in fact it wishes to have some states regulation, have a great deal or to have none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.685" offset="8882134">Now, in the Social Security Act, the incentives that I referred to were a really very strong either/or, and to give you the idea of what that either/or was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.268" offset="8928423">For the states that refused to pass a law, this is what would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.407" offset="8949008">Their employers would have to pay a 3% payroll tax on a portion of the salaries of all their employees and that money would never be returned to the states in any form, but would simply go to the Federal Government, in fact support unemployment insurance programs in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.430" offset="9025076">That's what would happen if the state refuse to pass an unemployment compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.220" offset="9048273">On the other hand, if it passed one, each employer would receive a 90% tax credit, which he would receive merely by virtue of paying the state tax, whatever that state tax was, when the state tax was at the maximum that the state set or nothing at all, he would still receive that 90% tax credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.567" offset="9137612">And the other 10%, which was not wiped out by the credit, would in any event be returned to the states either to support federal benefits or to help administer the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.944" offset="9191111">So, that was an extremely pervasive kind of incentive, in fact so much so that the law was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.136" offset="9227891">As usurping state powers, as coercing the states to come into the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.657" offset="9254013">And this Court considered that question in Steward versus Machine Company and it decided that yes, these were very pervasive incentives, but because of the latitude given to the states in developing their own program, that Congress what entitled to keep those incentives in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.142" offset="9351920">So that Congress has from the very inception of both the NLRA and the Social Security Act considered the interrelation of unemployment insurance and the economics of labor disputes --</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.211" offset="10328168">Now, we've noted that the NLRA and the Social Security Act were passed at the same time, by the same Congress sitting in the same session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.091" offset="10355754">In 1947, there was an attempt to amend the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.630" offset="10377906">In fact, the House passed amendments, which said that any employee who receive unemployment compensation, while he was on strike would be deprived of his protection and status as an employee under the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.799" offset="10442585">Now, House Minority Report in commenting on that interestingly enough pointed to the Social Security Act as the core of Congress' intent on this question and said, under the Social Security Act, this matter has advisedly been left to the states and that was a criticism of the House Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.236" offset="10516355">The Senate refused to go along with those amendments and they were dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.703" offset="10542164">Then in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act you have a situation, which has lasted for more than 40 years, where there is a requirement of paying unemployment benefits to striking railway workers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.084" offset="10919685">Under the -- under the plan of the Social Security Act, I think it has to be kept in mind what that plan was, the plan was to give permissions to the states, which were plenary and general and to spell out only those few areas, in which the states were restricted, that's how the law is setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.234" offset="11000351">It wasn't setup with you may do this, and this, and this, and this, and this but rather because of the need to bring the state into the field, the urgent federal state cooperation that was absolutely essential to the success of the Social Security Act, the plan was to make clear to the states that they had this broad latitude that there would be no dictation from Washington and that they would be restricted in only a few particulars, all of which was set out in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.615" offset="11113827">So, that was how the Act was structured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.843" offset="11126784">Then when Congress considered the question of food stamps, and whether they should be granted to strikers, Congress had another opportunity to look at the relation of the payment of public benefits and the economics of labor disputes, and what they said there was that food stamps must be paid to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.424" offset="11213093">And the reason that they gave was that to deny benefits would be to take sides in labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.580" offset="11249664">So obviously, the idea of neutrality which petitioners are trying to present here is quite different from Congress' idea of neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.283" offset="11284459">In AFDC-U, that is Aid to Families of Dependent Children with Unemployed Fathers, uniform definitions were established by Congress but the ATW secretary under a regulation upheld by this Court did preserve local options to the states, who could take their choice as to whether to grant benefits or to refuse to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.508" offset="11393442">A contemporary congressional expression about the Social Security Act also occurred when the Nixon administration in the 91st Congress era asked that the Congress supply the bar against striker benefits, which the petitioners are now asking from the judiciary, they said, don't let the states pay unemployment benefits to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.087" offset="11495737">Now, Congress refused to go along with that recommendation and Representative Mills, who was Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee said in floor debate, Well, for example, there are states that pay unemployment benefits to strikers, I wouldn't vote for it, but if they want to do it, why shouldn't they have the latitude to write the program they want.</text>

            <text syncTime="3540.394" offset="14264926">But as I said before, the confidence that Congress visited in us has not been abused by that sort of provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.642" offset="14289899">In conclusion, I'd like to say that at stake in this case is the state's right to determine what's in the best interest of New York citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.493" offset="14329396">And Congress has given New York that right, given that right, knowing exactly what New York's law said at the time that it passed both the statutes that were speaking of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.721" offset="14382268">And it's rare that you have so many different indications of congressional intent, all pointing in the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.547" offset="14417586">And petitioner's proffering response only a general pre-emption principle derived from the overall plan of the NLRA, which has never been held to be absolute.</text>
