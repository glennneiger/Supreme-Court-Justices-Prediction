            <text syncTime="44.462" offset="254642">Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court. I represent the Oneida Indians of New York State and the Oneida Indians of Wisconsin, in a suit against Madison on Oneida Counties of New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.347" offset="322142">This is an equitable-type action concerning the lands currently being used by the Defendant’s Counties but allegedly owned by the Oneida Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.251" offset="377731">The sole issue on this appeal is the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts to hear this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.589" offset="419109">The complaint alleges and recites three treaties and one statute under which the United States has guaranteed to the Plaintiffs, the possession of the reservation including the land which we are now talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.965" offset="500611">The complaint further alleges that in the year 1795, the State of New York acquired the land in question illegally in contravention of the treaties and in contravention of the State Law for the Federal Law, excuse me, which holds that no purchase of Indian lands without the consent of United States shall be of any validity in law or equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.387" offset="626312">The complaint also alleges that the price we receive was unconscionable and inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.688" offset="655464">It alleges that the value of the land was misrepresented to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.026" offset="676885">It alleges that at the time the sale took place the Indians, the Plaintiffs could not read or write.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.635" offset="707291">It alleges that two years after the purchase of the State, the land was resold at a profit of approximately 500%, I might point out that this resale of land was in the main to developers who resold shortly after at a further profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.916" offset="788376">The complaint also alleges that the consent of the United States was neither sought nor obtained by the State to the sale, and further, that the State knew of this requirement of Federal Law because just three years later in 1798, the State Legislature asked the Federal Government to appoint a Commissioner who would represent the Indians at a purchase with which took place in 1798, which is not the subject to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.170" offset="941453">The Oneida Indians has sought to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with the New York and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.773" offset="975830">Therefore in 1964, they appealed to the Attorney General of the State of New York for help who received none.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.369" offset="1006237">In 67, we appealed to the Governor of New York and he referred us to the Constitutional Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.061" offset="1032986">In 67, we appealed of the Constitutional Convention and at that time the Attorney General appeared and said this is a legislative matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.161" offset="1073424">In 68, we appealed of the President of United States as required by our treaty and we also appealed to Congress in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.656" offset="1115324">We were denied any relief at all, and therefore at long last, the Oneidas brought this case which I consider to be an equitable-type action.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.679" offset="1163494">We’re reciting the treaties, we’re reciting the law, we’re reciting what happened, and we’re asking that the Federal Courts take jurisdiction and arrive at some kind of an equitable solution, an answer to the pleas of justice of the Oneida Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="685.988" offset="2820702">In every case, there was an alternate state remedy and we contend that both under the State Law up to 1958 and the Federal Law down to this day, there is no way that the Oneida Indians or any other Indian tribe can bring an action in a court, State Court of New York State for question dealing with land claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.351" offset="2934178">It seems pretty clear to me that under the law, the legislation giving civil jurisdiction to State Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1274.198" offset="5173499">Federal jurisdiction to hear the petitioners’ complaint is bottomed primarily upon 28 United States Code Sections 1331 and 1362.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.514" offset="5214772">And in 1958, when Section 28 United States Code 1331 was amended the increase, the jurisdictional amount was from $3,000.00 to $10,000.00 and that was the only change that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.613" offset="5267226">There is nothing in the statutory provisions or in the legislative history that would indicate that Congress intended to revamp the well-pleaded complaint rule to which Your Honors have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.946" offset="5320516">It is submitted that the provisions under which these petitioners have bottomed their case is Section 1362 and there is no language in the change that would indicate direct or indirect that Congress intended to change or alter the well-pleaded complaint rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.874" offset="5412258">Thus, the question presented is whether that Congress repeal that rule when it enacted Section 1362 and employ the identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.482" offset="5454681">And we further contend that there is no jurisdiction because of the diversity of the citizenship rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.177" offset="5657496">Now, their complaint at the motion to dismiss contained 11 separate grounds and they are grouped into four basic groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.829" offset="5696052">The first was lack of original jurisdiction of the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.991" offset="5712666">The second was, the controversy was in fact against the State of New York and United States and not against these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.114" offset="5741192">Thirdly, that there was an identical claim pending against United States before the Indian Land Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.975" offset="5764598">And lastly, about the complaint fail -- an amended complaint fail to state a course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.934" offset="5784451">If I believe not only before Your Honors is the question of the jurisdiction but all of those because this was what the motion originally was made for and this was the motion that was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.867" offset="5832202">Now, to succeed here therefore it is my contention that they must establish one, the original jurisdiction of the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.757" offset="5859788">Two, the right to sue the Defendants who are holding the lands in this case for the benefit of the people in the State of New York or the people of the State of New York in the governmental capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.737" offset="6147657">Now, it’s our contention here first that the well-pleaded complaint rule is -- they contend that the well-pleaded complaint rule is inapplicable to the 28 U.S.C. 1362.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.409" offset="6202410">Despite the fact that it’s always been held to be applicable to 1331 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.907" offset="6220382">Both of these are jurisdictional sections and provide that the course in action must arise under the Constitution Laws and Treaties of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.117" offset="6253192">The same language was used in both and there was no change of this in the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.566" offset="6271060">The difference within one was that at the claim must exceed 10,000 and the other that the claim must be brought by an Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.101" offset="6297182">Now, these statutes are in pari materia, the same language was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.412" offset="6314423">The Court -- when Congress uses the same language and that language has been always interpreted to include the best, the complaint rule, then it is certainly was meant to include it in this case too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.262">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.485">When the red light went on yesterday, we were talking about Section 1331 (a) and 1362 being in pari materia and I maintain that if the well-pleaded complaint rule was applicable to 1331 (a) it must also be applicable to 1362.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.633">As a matter of fact, the Senate Report and I got a quote here from it, that was made at the time of the enactment of these bills and the House Report contains similar language says, “The purpose of the Bill as amended is to permit Indian tribes to bring civil actions arising under the Constitution Treaties and Laws of the United States without regard to the $10,000.00 limitation and accordingly amends Chapter 85 Title 28 United States Code by adding new Section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.016">Now, the same reports and I got it as an appendix to my brief states that the reason this was necessary or came about was a Federal case Yoda(ph) against Asian Born(ph) 339 F2 360.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.656">In that case, the Court held there was Federal question but because the jurisdictional amount wasn’t met, the claim was dismissed and it was because of the Yoda case that they felt it was necessary to amend the law by giving the Indians the right to sue where the amount was less than $10,000.00, since most of the Indian claims being individual was less than $10,000.00 and they could not group them or take them to get jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.404">Now yesterday, Your Honors went into the question of whether the Plaintiffs have a right to sue in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.814">It is our contention that Plaintiffs do have a right to sue in New York State that is if they have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.771">We do not concede that they have a case in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.275">Now, Plaintiffs say that they do not have this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.840">We maintain that New York states Indian Law Sections 5 and 11 (a) given that right to sue a New York State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.252">Is it enough that New York states Indian Law gives the petitioners here the right to sue or do you have to show to the Federal Law that was New York Court’s the authority to entertain such as this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeremiah_jochnowitz" startTime="1739.495" stopTime="1955.708">
            <label>Mr. Jeremiah Jochnowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="1739.495">Alright now, on that question I think I call your attention to the Seneca versus Christy case in 1891.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.983">In Seneca versus Christy, the Seneca Nation sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.746">They have been given special permission by a New York State statute to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.750">Now, New York State upheld their right to sue but decided against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.466">It's decided against them first on a question of the Indian Nonintercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.176">It stated that the original Act passed in 1790 contained a statement any state where they have the right of preemption to such answer or not was banned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.783">The 1790 -- they went in under 1800 something statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.624">Ours is the 1793 statute but both had this portion deleted and the New York State Court of Appeals at that time held that the deletion of these words indicated, that the Congress intended that the preemption state should not be barred from having deals with the Indians, and this as a matter of fact the Christy case shows New York followed over a hundred years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.079">Now, the second reason why the Indians would deny relief in New York was the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.252">The act which they sued under said they could sue to the same extent as other persons and statute of limitations is about for anybody who brings his action too late and they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.467">Now, there is similar wedding in New York State Indian Law Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.951">Now, Seneca was appealed to the United States Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court held that it was decided on two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.968">One of them the Federal question, the first question which I discussed and the second limitation which was a state question and it said, since it could be maintained under a state question, the decision of the Court of Appeals would not be vacated and so, in the Seneca case I say this Court has already ruled that when New York State grants the right to sue, there is the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.699">Now, Indian Law Section 5 was first enacted in 1902 that was right after the Seneca case, 1892 rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.033">In 1902, the New York State Land Commission acting through the Attorney General issued an opinion stating that “The law gives the Indians the right to ejectment in Courts of record to the same extent as other citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.379">Here the action is basically an ejectment action, in an ejectment action the right is based on the right to possession of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.725">Here there right to damages would only be because they were being denied possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.741">In other words, they must have had a right to possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.503">Now, in the petition for certiorari, the proponents give excerpts from a affidavit by Donald Segun(ph), an Assistant Attorney General, and in that case he took the position at that time that there was no capacity to sue in New York's state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.313">However, that was our position only in the Court of Claims that position we changed and because we found we were wrong, and in the Court of Appeals opinion it says as follows, and that’s Saint Bridget’s(ph) versus State of New York, 5 New York second 24, and that’s on page 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.937">On this appeal, the state concedes that the claimants have capacity to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.474">They do not argue if there is a defect in indispensable parties. So,--</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeremiah Jochnowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="1957.445">Saint Bridget’s is cited in my brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.592">Now, if they sue under New York State Law, there is a possibility of the defense of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.441">As a matter of fact, standing to sue does not mean that they are going to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.744">If they sue us in the State of New York, we are going to fight like to dues to keep them from winning and I think we have grounds, the merits of this but we would not raise if they brought an action against the State in the Court of Claims, we would not raise the questions of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.144">I have been authorized to say this by the Solicitor General of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.791">Now in the brief, Plaintiffs contend further that the New York State, that the right to sue was brought about because of 25 U.S.C. 233.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.113">Now, 25 U.S.C. 233 they say and it does contain a limitation that the right to sue is for actions and events transpiring, if the September 13, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.114">Well, let’s say assuming their right, what are they suing for here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.269">Rent?</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.427">Damages in the form of rent that occurred after January 1, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.197">The course of action accrues after the deadline date of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.758">So even on the rent own interpretation of a statute, they have no right to be here and we also maintain that 25 U.S.C. made it mandatory for New York State to permit Indians to sue in their state for events that occurred after September 13, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.149">But it did not prevent us from giving him the right to sue for events that occurred prior to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.456">This we say we could do and that we did do it and this we say, your Court has held we could do in the case of Seneca versus Christy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.770">Now, Plaintiffs here state that Indian Law Section 11 (a) and that’s the law that says, Not only do Indians have the right to sue but Indian tribes and Indian bands have the right to sue in New York was passed as a result of 25 U.S.C. 233.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.472">In this they are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.909">This is not the section that was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.549">The section was passed at the time of 233 was the Amendment to Indian Law Section 5, and we have a letter that we cite the contents of it in our own brief, by the Attorney General of the State of New York to the Government at the time that was been enacted and it says, “The Bill will not take away jurisdiction from the peacemakers Court but we will give the State Court’s concurrent jurisdiction. This step is authorized by Congress, if such authority was needed we question the need even then that of the authority too and we maintain that we could grant the authority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.754">And they referred to the Act of September 13, 1952, 25 U.S.C. 233.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.272">Thus, it was the Amendment to Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.541">Now Section 11 (a) was passed in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.855">This removes any doubt on their right to sue, in it, it has granted the right to not only to individual Indians but Indian tribes and Indian bands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.816">In other words, whatever the status of an Indian tribe is whether corporate or not corporate or whatever it is, New York State by Section of 11 (a) recognizes there right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.940">We also say the action must be dismissed because there is another action pending at this time and the other action pending is the claim by the Indians before the Indian Commissioners and it was cited in the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.602">Now, Your Honors were questioning my opponent here on whether, why that was not a duplication of damages?</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.982">I do not see why it isn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.477">He makes some sort of distinction he says that before the Indian Court of Claims, all they could get is the damages they suffered at the time that the transaction was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.190">Actually, if they have, United States has giving them the right to sue for what they were damaged and if they have a right to sue for the damages, it would be total damages including increase of interest are damages and if they suffer them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.974">Now, in Seneca versus United States 173 Court of Claims 912 and then several other cases, the United States Court of Claims held that there is a claim in favor of Indians for -- under circumstances  where the Indian tribe sold land without being represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.267">It however, did not reach the question of whether New York State was bound by the Nonintercourse Act or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.870">It cited a number of authorities in the opinion which held otherwise but didn’t reach a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.851">Now, we also maintain here that the Eleventh Amendment is a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.757">The Defendants here are the Counties of Oneida and Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.270">In the complaint, it is alleged that the lands were used for the building of roads and other public improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.500">The use of the property by a county in a governmental capacity is protected by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.214">When a county does so, it is acting for the state and as such it enjoys the state’s immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.513">Didn’t we say that a county doesn’t partake of the state’s immunity enough to invoke the Eleventh Amendment and cites them all the cases of this Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeremiah Jochnowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="2302.527">I am not sure Your Honor on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.630">And certainly, if the Eleventh Amendment is a defense here, then the Indians who would come in under the theory of either as suing the State would be either a citizen of this State or a citizen of Wisconsin in either case under the Parton(ph) case they could not sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.970">Now, we also maintain here and this probably would only go in the event, Your Honors, would decide that they have a original jurisdiction on the question of 1362 and might be referred back to the Circuit Court, that a complaint does not state the course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.767">And one other things I want to call to Your Honors’ attention is that there was a substantial difference as it was cited in Seneca v. Christy case between the Law of 1790 and the Law of 1793.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.158">The Law of 1790 was specifically forbad states having the right of preemption to enter to an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.388">The Law of 1793 which was a law in effect at the time this transaction was made had that portion deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.975">It did not contain this ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.000">Now, New York State as was shown in Christy made 39 treaties during that period of time after the Law of 1793 went into effect and only five of them did not have a Federal Commission of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.149">Now, the United States recognized this, the United States in many cases granted substitute lands to the Indians who have sold to the United States, they passively approved this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.207">The Indians made no complaint, we have almost 200 years that have gone by and a practical construction such as we had here which the parties have undertaken for such a long period of time should not be change even if there is  and equally tenable interpretation the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.037">In the instant case, I say this is very necessary because if we follow through the fruits of a decision against us, we would really have an economic upheaval in all of the preemption states where deals were made for the purchase of land probably about 200 years ago, and it would be upsetting titles all over the Eastern part of the Country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.297">I have very short concluding statement to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.903">As I listen to my brothers here, as I listen to the questions of the Court directed to me yesterday I have this to say that when you boil this case all down, the only question for this Court to decide is whether lack of possession will bar the Oneida Indians and other Indians throughout the United States from Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.119">Three treaties, federal statutes and the specific words of President George Washington to the six nations have promised possession to the Oneidas and the other six nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.138">The First President in 1790 said to the Seneca’s, “In behalf of the six nations, the general Government will never consent to your being defrauded but it will protect in all your just rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.778">And further I am on the same speech, President Washington in a slightly different context, I must admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.289">But he did say to the Seneca’s that the Federal Courts will be open to you for your just claims or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.329">This speech is pointed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.171">Now, all the Oneidas want is a fair hearing and to me under the very singular facts, treaties, and laws present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.071">A hearing should be available to them even under the most restrictive interpretation of Section 1331 and certainly, under the broader meaning given to Section 1362 in Congress in 1966.</text>
