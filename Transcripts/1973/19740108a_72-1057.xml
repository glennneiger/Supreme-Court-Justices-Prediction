            <text syncTime="17.846" offset="148167">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.906" offset="160392">We have two cases, United States against Giordano and United against -- United States against Chavez which involves the suppression of wire interception evidence and the fruits of that evidence in narcotics cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.105" offset="213159">The cases are here on writs of certiorari to the Fourth and Ninth Circuits respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.420" offset="234475">In both cases the District Court suppressed the evidence applying Title III of the organized -- of the Title III of the Safe Streets Statute and this Court of Appeals affirmed and this Court granted the Government petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.301" offset="325904">These two cases represent a great many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.459" offset="338547">Some of them pending here on petitions for certiorari and others awaiting resolution in lower courts being held up.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.311" offset="369998">The issue as the Government sees it is entirely a statutory one.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.064" offset="385045">It’s a -- the construction of Title III of the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Government's -- the propriety, the adequacy of the Government’s procedures in processing applications to courts for orders permitting wire interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.835" offset="476056">The -- in addition to the adequacy of those procedures, the cases raise the question of whether assuming the procedures were in some degree defective, suppression is the remedy called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.082" offset="529032">At the outset I’d like to stress what these cases are not about.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.086" offset="545123">There are no constitutional violations in our view in these cases, no violations of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.036" offset="568842">Those provisions of this statute which were going to comply with this Court’s decisions in the Burger and Cass were fully complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.877" offset="604264">Courts did pass upon probable cause and all other Fourth Amendment elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.097" offset="625162">There’s no contention nor I think could there be any, but the evidence that has been suppressed is not reliable evidence, there is not accurate evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.764" offset="655778">There is no question in this case -- in these cases of convicting innocent persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.017" offset="680856">I think as we look at the case and the facts, it will also become perfectly plain that the Government’s procedures which in one or two respects certainly must be said to be not the best compliance with some aspects of the statute, do not display any malevolent purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.395" offset="786286">There was no sinister purpose, there was no purpose of hiding anything in these procedures and I think insofar as there was a deviation from a procedure, we can just -- we can demonstrate that it was a harmless error and an error I might add which is now have been corrected.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.035" offset="960888">In every one of these cases, there was a letter authorizing an application which went out over the signature of Mr. Will Wilson, then head of the Criminal Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.480" offset="1026717">The letter looked as if Mr. Will Wilson had made the operative decision to authorize the application to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.114" offset="1069244">As a result, the Court orders identified Mr. Wilson as the person who had authorized the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.821" offset="1100069">In fact, those applications had been authorized either by the Attorney General in most cases and in some cases by the executive assistant, the Attorney General Mr. Sullivan involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.957" offset="1344575">When it was thought by an investigator or a field attorney that a wire interception order was required or was appropriate, he would then gather together the information and affidavits and the application to show probable cause, the necessity for the use of wire interception as a technique and the other aspects of the statute calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.238" offset="1433704">He would forward that to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.885" offset="1444258">In Washington, it was reviewed by an attorney in the special unit of the organized crime and racketeering section of the Criminal Division, a special unit setup just for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.450" offset="1486576">That was the main review.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.706" offset="1499533">It then went with the memorandum from the attorney in that unit to the Assistant Attorney General of a Criminal Division whereby designation it was reviewed by one of the two deputies, one of the two deputies, Attorney General’s Mr. Shapiro or Mr. Peterson at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.021" offset="1568810">Should they approve and I should stress that at every level, disapproval meant it was sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.831" offset="1588036">It did not -- if anybody disapproved, it did the applic -- the authorization -- that request did not go on and a number of them were in fact sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.962" offset="1624607">Should they approve the application and the memo were sent up to the Attorney General’s office where it was reviewed by the Executive Assistant Mr. Sol Lindenbaum, who was been the executive assistant to the Attorney’s General starting with Attorney General Mr. Ramsey Clark and is still the Executive Assistant to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.586" offset="1703079">Mr. Lindenbaum would review it and then send it on to the Attorney General, Mr. Mitchell with his recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.680" offset="1751458">Through 1969 when this practice -- when the experience with the statute first began, 33 such applications were authorized by Mr. Mitchell personally.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.189" offset="1845499">As 1970 began and the flow of these applications begin to increase and Mr. Mitchell began to do some traveling.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.431" offset="2486439">In the 1971 when these practice was first questioned in Court because the Department of Justice said no inkling, anybody, they're being troublesome about this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.749" offset="2519771">When they were first questioned in the Court, they changed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.097" offset="2537117">But I wish to say, about those 170 or so applications that were authored by -- authorized by Mr. Lindenbaum putting Mr. Mitchell’s signatures on the memorandum, that a great many of those were in fact applications that had been authorized by Mr. Mitchell over the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.261" offset="2621753">Mr. Lindenbaum had gotten to him over the telephone, had read hem the stuff and read him the material and had received Mr. Mitchell’s approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.422" offset="2654459">And so that Mr. Lindenbaum was performing in those cases a ministerial act only of doing what Mr. Mitchell conformed we should do. Unfortunately, Mr. Lindenbaum did not keep a record of the telephone calls so that we in every case in which Mr. Lindenbaum put Mr. Mitchell signatures on the memorandum, we must assume that that maybe a case in which there was no telephone authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.478" offset="2766681">Although we know that a great many of them were in fact authorized by telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.613" offset="2791236">It’s at this stage that the first problem of -- or claim of violation of the statute occurs because in Title III, 18 U.S.C 2516, it is provided that the Attorney General or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General may authorize an application to a federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.528" offset="2906906">And the claim is that when Mr. Lindenbaum, the Executive Assistant applying the policy laid down for him by the Attorney General authorized that that falls outside the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.514" offset="2970854">Now, the second issue arises because of the form of the memorandum that Mr. Lindenbaum or Mr. Mitchell in most cases actually initialed.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.490" offset="3018710">The form of the memorandum was draft -- the memorandum was drafted so as to track the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.524" offset="3054864">That memorandum was drafted by so far as we can tell by an attorney in the special unit which first reviews these things and send up with the file from Mr. Mitchell to authorize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.997" offset="3100735">And it was in the form of a special delegation so that when the memorandum was initialed, it went back down to the Criminal Division, addressed to Mr. Wilson saying pursuant to the powers conferred on me by Section 2516 of Title 18, you are hereby specially designated to exercise those powers for the purpose of authorizing, the particular trial attorney, to make the above described application.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.142" offset="3221316">He’s delegate -- he’s designated solely for the purpose of authorizing it so that it’s understood that Mr. Wilson is to perform a ministerial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.490" offset="3258723">He’s not designated to make any judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.313" offset="3266038">In fact the judgment of the Criminal Division had already been made when the file was on its way up or it wouldn’t have gone up.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.213" offset="3309610">The net result was, when that memorandum went down, this ministerial act of affixing a -- Mr. Wilson’s signature to a letter was performed by one of his two deputies, both of whom were authorized to do this in a number of matters to Mr. Henry Peterson and Mr. Harold Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.896" offset="3384320">The letter went out, as we have noted, looking as if Mr. Wilson had made the operative decision when in fact the Attorney General had made the operative decision or in some cases, the Attorney General’s executive assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.118" offset="3449208">And the Attorney in the field would have no way of knowing about this memorandum in its form and why does it occur, so he would assume, usually that Mr. Will Wilson had made the operative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.384" offset="3530292">And he would so tell the Court and it is claimed there and the Court would include that fact in its order and the claim therefore is that Section 2518 of Title 18 which provides that each application shall include the following information; (a) the identity of the author authorizing the application and in 4 (d); the identity of the person authorizing the application must be in the judge’s order, the wire intercept order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.356" offset="13326211">We have cited a series of them at page 53 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.494" offset="13350766">You have Title III, the same statute we’re dealing with here, 18 U.S.C. 2514 which is the witness immunity statute which is -- it’s given to the -- Attorney General is given the power to grant a witness immunity and it has been held that that function of the Attorney General, given to the Attorney General by the statute maybe delegated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.589" offset="13451076">You have I think an even clearer example in the second paragraph at the footnote on that page, in the case of Jay against Boyd construing 8 U.S.C. 1254, a statute which says that the Attorney General “may in his discretion” suspend the part -- deportation of any alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.159" offset="13541355">That language seems to me to imply even more than the language in the statute we’re examining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.724" offset="13559641">That it is a personal decision of the Attorney General and that -- yet this Court has held that that statutory power maybe delegated and in Kleindienst against Mandel which is quoted at the bottom of that footnote, the Attorney General was given discretion which was in fact in that case exercised by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.173" offset="13661414">He delegated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.389" offset="13670296">So that Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Lindenbaum were operating against the background of statutes was a general delegation statute and specific other statutes giving the Attorney General the power or the duty to do things which had been delegated in which delegations have been upheld in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.977" offset="13852630">I think there’s a limitation obviously but I think the limitation is best read as to the office, the immediate control of one of these two officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.006" offset="13900800">And I say that because we have two examples in our brief on page 57 and page 58 in which this same Congress had provided a couple of months before that something must be done by the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General which parallels the language we’re talking about and then Congress went on and said, “Which function may not be delegated?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.243" offset="14009678">Now, when you compare that with the language here, I think Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Lindenbaum had a right to say, here as an Attorney General and a Deputy Attorney General, just is in the statute, Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.544" offset="14070909">In the civil rights act they say it may not be delegated, in this statute they don’t say it which I think gave them a right to think that some delegation within the office was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.953" offset="14116571">Again, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act which we discussed on page 50 has the same kind of language about the Secretary Health, Education and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.791" offset="14159935">There -- and I should say one more thing, if you look, if one looks at the 2516 (2), we see that Congress clearly allows hundreds of state prosecutors to authorize these applications and in fact, in the legislative history which we quote in the brief, it says the question of whether the state officer may delegate, State Attorney General may delegate will be controlled by the law of delegation of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.968" offset="14276650">Now, that takes the heart out of this argument that Congress was so concerned that the Attorney General himself had to involve himself from the minutiae of every application for a wire interception order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3657.715" offset="14707566">I think it’s true in the State Government, I think that’s true in the Federal Government under standard delegation law that we’ve just discussed.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Russel Smouse</label>
            <text syncTime="3928.468" offset="15790602">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.231" offset="15805649">In the Giordano case the Court has confronted with compounded violations of Title III, specifically Sections 2516 (1) and 2518 (1) (a) and (4) (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.598" offset="15855177">As for the Section 2516 point, the fact is that on October 16, 1970, Francis S. Brocato, an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Maryland submitted to Chief Judge Northrop of the United State District Court for Maryland, an application for an order authorizing the interception of wire communications on the telephone of my client, Dominic Nicholas Giordano.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.066" offset="15952980">Attached to the application as exhibits were a “Will Wilson letter” to Mr. Brocato and the affidavits of two agents of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.080" offset="15997074">The Will Wilson letter evidences the fact that Mr. Brocato had requested authorization to apply for the wiretap order, this request having been made to then Attorney General John N. Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.969" offset="16052663">Although the request had been directed to the Attorney General, the record submitted in this case shows that it never was reviewed by the Attorney General himself, but that his initials had been placed on the authorization memorandum by Mr. Sol Lindenbaum, his Executive Assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.084" offset="16129045">This authorization memorandum had then been dispatched to Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson or the Office of Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson purportedly designating Mr. Wilson to authorize the application to be presented to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.999" offset="16208771">The record in this case and in the case of murder in the evidentiary hearing held before Judge Merchants (ph) in the Southern District of Florida, evidences the fact that the Attorney General had never specially designated any of his Assistant Attorneys General to issue wiretap authorizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.797" offset="16287974">It is also uncontested that the Will Wilson letters indeed were never signed by Mr. Wilson, not in this case nor indeed in any of the host of cases which have arisen in this series of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.445" offset="16346488">There was subsequent to the application for a wiretap order, application for an extension order dated November 6, 1970, some 21 days after the original application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.239" offset="16397688">I believe the Solicitor General indicated perhaps some seven days after the original application, the Attorney General had become familiar with the operative facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.973" offset="16436663">The affidavit of Mr. Lindenbaum indicates that some 21 days later, the Attorney General authorized the application for an extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.732" offset="16479713">Included within that application for extension was another Will Wilson letter and an additional affidavit from agent Abraham Azaon (ph) of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.979" offset="16524643">On review of the Azaon affidavit, it is to be noted that the operative facts setting forth probable cause are those investigative details and intelligence which developed pursuant to the original wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.299" offset="16585979">The Government I believe in its brief indicates that the Azaon application reasserts the facts that was set forth in the original application, indeed, they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.807" offset="16624013">It merely states I reassert without specifying what those facts were, the fact set forth in the original application, indeed, it is an incorporation by reference type approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.935" offset="16676467">I would ask this Honorable Court to look critically at the particular facts in the case at hand as indeed I suspect they are at perhaps some variance from the facts which the Government indicates in its brief developed at some subsequent point in time with regard to checking with the Attorney General and apprising him of the facts after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.154" offset="16773329">As for the Section 2518 point, it must be noted that not only did Mr. Wilson not sign the letter, he indeed never saw any of the papers in this case nor indeed did the Attorney General prior to the application for the extension order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.037" offset="16832888">Mr. Wilson testified as I indicated before at the evidentiary hearing in the Southern District of Florida in the Marder case, at which time he stated he did not know that the Will Wilson letter was being submitted to United State District Courts around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.361" offset="16886178">In fact, he testified the “did not know exactly what was made of them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.749" offset="16907703">He did not know that Mr. Lindenbaum was signing the Attorney Generals initials to authorization memos.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.435" offset="16930482">He did not know that anyone other than the Attorney General, in fact, was authorizing wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.334" offset="16954096">I would submit to this Honorable Court that this suggests a rather amazing lack of communication within the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.225" offset="16985652">This incredibly loose procedure led the late Judge Sobeloff to conclude in his opinion below and I quote “If Judge Northrop had been aware of the real status of the application, that neither Mitchell nor Wilson even knew of it and that the application had been approved and initialed JNM by Lindenbaum, we are certain that he would have refused to permit the wiretap.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.382" offset="17082305">The sequence of events here involve I submit constitutes the “elaborate paper charade” which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit condemned in the King case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.595" offset="17131102">It is significant that where the violations herein question have been shown to exist in combination, the vast majority of Federal Courts have found a violation of 2516 and have decreed suppression as the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.055" offset="17188989">In addition to the Giordano case in the Fourth Circuit, there is the opinion of course of the Robinson Court in the Fifth Circuit, the per curiam opinion in the Robert’s case in the Seventh Circuit, the opinion of the Ninth Circuit in the King Case and the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the Mantello case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4438.016" offset="17828780">The Robert’s Courts speaks of the persuasive reason -- reasoning of Judge Sobeloff in Giordano.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.599" offset="17851141">Indeed Giordano seems to be the case most frequently looked to for guidance, most frequently cited and whose language is most frequently adopted by other Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.054" offset="17900983">The Court’s have with overwhelming consistency really viewed the 2516 defect as a substantial violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.895" offset="17944346">With this background in mind, I would like to turn to Section 2516 with the rationale for that Section and speak to the Government’s contentions concerning the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.787" offset="17983948">Judge Sobeloff in his opinion below effectively lays to rest the alter ego theory which has with recurring predictability been advanced by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.024" offset="18024803">Judge Sobeloff stating in pertinent part, “the alter ego theory is open ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.718" offset="18043611">It need not stop with Lindenbaum but could be extended with an equal claim of validity to anyone within or without the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.853" offset="18076212">In determining who qualifies as an alter ego, it would permit side stepping the Congressional mandate, fixing the level of those who maybe designated to authorize applications.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.381" offset="18122292">Senate Report 1097 is instructive wherein referring to Section 2516 (1), it is stated and I quote this language which has earlier been referred to by I believe Mr. Justice Brennan but which I feel bears repeating, “This provision centralizes in a publicly responsible officials subject to the political process, the formulation of law enforcement policy on the use of electronic surveillance techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.845" offset="18224170">Centralization will avoid the possibility that divergent practices might develop, should abuses occur, the lines of responsibility lead to an identifiable person.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.439" offset="18262518">The legislative history of course speaks to identifiable person and not an identifiable office.</text>

            <text syncTime="5383.822" offset="21612042">Congress cognizant of this express concerned by this Court for the need to embrace protective procedures, framed Title III in an effort to meet those concerns and to meet Congressional concern over a limited approach in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.330" offset="21706083">Again, if I may borrow from the language of Judge Sobeloff, rejecting the Government contention that suppression would be inappropriate, he stated and I quote, “This is a beautiful example of a bootstrap technique characterization with which judge Donahue in the Ninth Circuit readily agreed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.878" offset="21776300">He goes on to say, “first, the Government minimizes the violation of the various statutory provisions, characterizing them as technical defects and then in typical bootstrap fashion postulates that for minor violations, there should be no sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.579" offset="21839099">The defects in this case however go to the very heart of Title III.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.622" offset="21875252">The Senate Report dealing with section 2515 provides that this Section must be read in light of Section 2518 (10) (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.113" offset="21913182">Again, the Gelbard opinion where Mr. Justice Brennan wrote for this Court is instructive in noting that indeed the Congressional findings articulate clearly the intent to utilize the evidentiary prohibition of 2515 to enforce the limitations imposed by Title III upon wiretapping and electronic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.102" offset="22017149">The Seventh Circuit in Robert’s meets the Government’s argument as to the drastic remedy of suppression by noting that 2515 and 2518 (10) (a) are patently clear in expressing the Congressional judgment that these intercepted communications may not be received in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.263" offset="22101786">This whole area I submit is placed in perspective by this additional cogent statement by Chief Judge Bazelon in the case of In Re Evans wherein he said, “First, 2515 describes in the most sweeping possible terms of prohibition against the use of evidence tainted by an awful wiretap, but the Section gives no indication of a specific remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.891" offset="22184333">Viewed as a whole, however, Omnibus Crime Control Act does provide such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.990" offset="22200738">The motion to suppress authorized by 2518 (10) (a).”</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.347" offset="22222158">The no need to deter argument rejected in Robinson which is here again advanced by the Government is disposed of in the Vicky (ph) case in the following fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.710" offset="22267611">The Government claims that no real deterrent effect would result from suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.652" offset="22283389">However, we are not dealing with the Court fashioned exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.380" offset="22302302">What we have here is a separate statutory requirement which this Court has no authority to ignore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.996" offset="22336784">Judge Becker enunciated the potential problem in the Narducci case wherein he stated, “The necessity for strict compliance with the statute in a wiretap situation stems as much from the precedence setting example of condoning laxity which could lead to further laxity in years to come.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.312" offset="22405956">As for the 2518 point, I will defer to Mr. Hewitt, he’ll argue the Chavez case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.902" offset="22428317">However, I would note that in this area, the Congress intended if indeed it be a matter of form, that form be treated as importantly as substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5601.137" offset="22481293">The implementation of this awesome authority, I submit, was to be treated in accordance with the statutory mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.440" offset="22514521">In our brief, reference is made to a course of conduct here engaged in by the Department of Justice as amounting to scheme of governmental trickery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.959" offset="22548584">On reflection, I submit and confess that this was too harsh a term to the extent that was too harsh a judgment, I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.027" offset="22584842">But if use of so dramatic a term is inappropriate, I would submit that what we have here is of course of governmental inattention, indeed, what I submit does amount to governmental willfulness and governmental sloppiness of a quality mounting up to gross mishandling in a particularly sensitive area, the appropriate remedy for which must necessarily be suppression of all evidence obtained from the wiretaps in this and cases similarly situated.</text>

            <label>Mr. James F. Hewitt</label>
            <text syncTime="5665.257" offset="22737816">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.197" offset="22753489">While the issues in Chavez involve both types of wiretaps here, the Sol Lindenbaum approved tap and the John Mitchell approved tap, since this Court granted the Government’s petition for certiorari limited to the issue of the tap purportedly approved by the Attorney General and the Chavez decision which based the decision as to that tap solely upon the application of 2518, I’ll try and limit my remarks to that aspect to this total problem, but there maybe some overlapping of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.151" offset="22877309">I would submit to the Court that this issue is important for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.498" offset="22894759">First, it involves a very important question of Congressional intent in the enactment of this legislation that affects the very sensitive area in this modern electronic age.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.447" offset="22934570">And secondly, the important issue is whether or not there has been compliance by the Justice Department with this mandate of Congress which surrounds virtually this authorization to engage in these authorized wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.771" offset="22991830">It’s obvious I think from the legislative history and certainly from the decision of the Ninth Circuit that the institutional decision was of some concern to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.778" offset="23031850">Mr. Justice Marshal asked the question of how often do these institutional decisions happen and I think it’s fair to say that they happen often enough over the history of our Justice Department that Congress was concerned about it and wanted to make sure that these wiretap applications would not be the subject of institutional decisions, they would not be rubber stamped and they would not be handled by a subordinate members of the Justice Department no matter how knowledgeable nor how responsible they might be in the performance of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.444" offset="23146475">It was for that reason that the legislative history is clear, that Congress wanted a responsible high ranking department official to make these decisions and recognizing that the Attorney General could not conceivably review and make these important decisions in every case, he was empowered to designate an Assistant Attorney General, a specifically identifiable officer within the department to act on these applications and make this decisions on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="5794.111" offset="23253159">Now, the purpose of this was obviously to fix responsibility on this identifiable person so that in later years or should a wiretap become a gross abuse of discretion, or abuse of prosecuted discretion, that Congress and the public and the Courts could put their finger on that responsible individual and point the finger -- the responsibility to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.610" offset="23335184">And for that reason, Congress made a rather unique provision in the statute that he be identified with particularity not only in the application but in the Court order itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.135" offset="23373322">That he’d be identified in the reports that the District Judge must make within 10 days after the completion of the wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.874" offset="23396206">That he’d be identified by the administrative officer of Courts and the annual report of the director and the annual report of the Judicial conference, so that this particular individual must be identified throughout the entire reporting scheme as the person who is responsible for the wiretap which bears his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.041" offset="23460885">And of course, the way to get this information is to have him set forth with accurate particularity in the application and the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="5896.627" offset="23663282">It sets forth that there must be a finding of need for the wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.382" offset="23678328">There must be a finding of probable cause and there must be this important prosecutor decision by this responsible officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.301" offset="23705913">The mere fact that the District Judge need not pass upon the propriety of the prosecuted decision of the responsible officer, doesn’t make it any less and important prong of this protective device that Congress setup within the statutory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="6231.469" offset="25002632">I make this finding, I make that finding, I’m satisfied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.068" offset="25017051">If Mr. Mitchell signed this letter saying, “I personally as Attorney General have reviewed this file and made these determinations then I think the District Judge must rely upon those determinations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6244.385" offset="25054250">But here, the District Judge rightfully and justifiably believed that these decisions were made by Will Wilson, the Assistant Attorney General who says he reviewed the file and made these important decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6255.798" offset="25099912">And this is simply, I urge Your Honors, it isn’t simply the finding of probable cause indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.349" offset="25118093">I think the prosecuted decision as to whether or not this is the type of case that justifies a wiretap is a very important one and I think the legislative scheme shows that there was not to be a rubber stamp, a blanket authority to tap any telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.766" offset="25171801">Only those phones that the Attorney General or a responsible designated assistant finds to justify this intrusion maybe used and I think that’s one of the important decisions that the District Judge was misled on as to who might have made that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.856" offset="25232196">Now, the government takes the position that that’s not a particularly important facet to the statutory scheme and I would submit to you Your Honors that it is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="6296.556" offset="25263020">That it's important in the sense that from the Congressional Record on August 11, 1969, Chairman McClellan summarized the first year of operation unto the Omnibus Crime Bill and he stated that apparently, and I call the Courts attention to page 23, 24-0, Chairman McClellan says apparently, “the prosecutor screening process is in fact having a healthy effect on the number of orders applied for and thus granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.553" offset="25370958">Indeed, it appears that a majority of the 167 applications that were approved for submission to the New York Courts were not approved in their original form.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6330.810" offset="25400007">He states also, “I would suggest that the application should be more complete on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.233" offset="25417665">Our thought was that mandating prosecutor involvement in the warrant process which strengthened it by guarantying that that decision to use these techniques would be preceded by a careful law enforcement screening process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6347.009" offset="25464790">Apparently, this practice is being meaningfully followed in the majority of cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6351.403" offset="25482344">He further states, “Prosecutors on whom the administration of the statute rests heavily should always carefully prepare and review these applications in light of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.383" offset="25514318">What may have been permissible under old practice is not necessarily legal now.</text>

            <text syncTime="6410.126" offset="25717238">And he further stated later that, “My purpose in making these remarks has been to help assure that this legislation will be in fact followed to the strictest letter of the law, both bringing criminals to book and protecting citizen’s privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.125" offset="25773244">That is the only way in which it can be utilized as an efficient tool in reducing crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.958" offset="25792575">He states as I’ve indicated, “my only concern at the moment is that the prosecutors in the Courts that has a responsibility under the statute would not become careless, but will remain firm in their determination to see that the statute is strictly followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.092" offset="25841162">If the statute is strictly followed, it is certainly not to be expected that any unnecessary invasion of privacy will result.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.891" offset="25868330">I think this is the undercurrent -- that underlies this legislation is that there are these strict requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.705" offset="25891527">These important decisions by prosecuting officers are an integral part of the scheme to set in motion a rather unique modern type of invasion of a citizen’s privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6464.870" offset="25936248">So I would say Your Honors that if the decision of the prosecutor in this case, either the Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General is important and the information concerning who made that decision is of equal crucial importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.105" offset="26017123">The Ninth Circuit in the decision in Chavez relied solely upon Section 28 -- 2518 which is the deficiency of the order, in effect holding that order that misidentifies the approving officer is the same as an order that would leave that information blank, and therefore, it would be defective on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.585" offset="26095073">I would submit to Your Honors that if the decision of the Ninth Circuit in Chavez is affirmed, of course, that would take care of the Giordano matter as well, since not withstanding whether Mr. Lindenbaum was or was not authorized if the -- as the Ninth Circuit held in Chavez, if the order itself is defective and thereby vitiating the entire validity of the wiretap, then both Chavez and Giordano will fall accordingly and that would be our protective position with respect to the second prong, the Chavez prong of the argument.</text>
