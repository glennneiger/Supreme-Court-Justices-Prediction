            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ll hear arguments next in two consolidated cases, 73-437 Mobil Oil against Federal Power, 73-457 Public Service Commission against Federal Power; and Municipal Distributors against Federal Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.760" offset="167811">It is three then not two.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.780" offset="307827">Mr. Gilliam.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carroll_l_gilliam" startTime="59.691" stopTime="892.221">
            <label>Mr. Carroll L. Gilliam</label>
            <text syncTime="59.691" offset="315559">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.512" offset="334785">I argue for petitioner Mobil Oil Corporation only.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.608" offset="351190">There are differences as to provision and result sought by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.178" offset="377417">These cases come from the Fifth Circuit and arise under Sections 4 and 5 of the National Gas Act and involve rates for natural gas producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.054" offset="424960">The proceedings before the Commission were to fix such rates for the Southern Louisiana area, both on shore and offshore, an area that now supplies approximately one-third of the nation’s interstate supply of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.441" offset="494550">As the issues reach this Court, the subject matter involves first, a fund of approximately $375 million which were amounts collected by producers in the area prior to August 1, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.677" offset="571455">The case also involves a rate structure that fixes charges to be made by producers to pipeline purchases of something in excess of $1 billion annually for each of the years after August 1, 1971 and under a rate structure that extends by terms to 1976 and 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.713" offset="679602">These two branches of the case became intertwined before the Commission and the background lies in two separate area rate cases, two Commission opinions and now two opinions by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.002" offset="740728">The first area rate case for Southern Louisiana was initiated in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.527" offset="766851">This led to what is denoted Commission Opinion number 546 issued in 1968 that was followed by review in the Fifth Circuit and opinions that are referred to in the briefs as the Austral case or Southern Louisiana 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.325" offset="846054">That opinion was an affirmance of Opinion number 546, but included language in the initial opinion and in a later opinion by the Fifth Circuit denying petitions for rehearing that give rise to the issues that are raised by the other petitioners, the Municipal Distributor Group and New York as to the Commission’s power thereafter to reopen the rates fixed by that opinion and to revise them.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.858" offset="968202">Those questions will be covered by Mr. Morrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.617" offset="983249">The second Southern Louisiana area rate case produced the opinion which is now here, denoted Commission Opinion number 598.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.910" offset="1020343">This proceeding was initiated in 1969 before review of the first opinion had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.468" offset="1050645">At first, it was restricted to rates for new contracts for new sales from the Federal offshore domain only.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.639" offset="1087321">Later, Commission Orders expanded the scope of the proceeding to include all producer sales in southern Louisiana and after the Austral decision by the Fifth Circuit, the Commission also enlarged the docket to include the issues of revision of the rates that had been fixed by the first opinion and to include the issues of disposition of refund liabilities that would have been fixed by the rates in the Commission’s first opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.604" offset="1219187">The proceeding before the Commission was before a hearing examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.821" offset="1236010">It was an adjudicatory type hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.062" offset="1253042">The cost data in the records are essentially the 1969 test year.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.657" offset="1275402">There are two major types.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.176" offset="1285433">One is what is called historical cost of flowing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.103" offset="1305182">This ultimately became the cost used to fixed rates for contracts dated prior to October 1, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.535" offset="1346873">The second major type of cost is the so called current cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.795" offset="1367980">This ultimately was used with reference to rates for what is called new gas and in this case, that classification is gas sold on the contracts dated after October 1, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.849" offset="1428167">There was other extensive evidence of economic, financial, supply demand, nature of the type that this Court reviewed in the Permian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.510" offset="1478740">There were conferences and then hearings before the examiner, beginning in 1969 and continuing to March 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.866" offset="1520222">While the hearing was in progress, a settlement conference was initiated under the Commission’s rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.373" offset="1550211">This conference is held off the record and all parties to a given proceeding are invited to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.605" offset="1583125">Those conferences resulted in the filing of a motion with the Commission by a group of distribution companies referred to in the briefs here as United Distribution Companies or UDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.748" offset="1635788">The motion was submitted November 1970, asking the Commission to approve a proposed settlement which was appended to the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.906" offset="1676330">The Commission then issued notice of that and provided for the filing of comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.573" offset="1699004">The comments indicated very wide support for the settlement from major producers in the area, pipeline purchasers, distribution companies in two groups and some state Commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.056" offset="1760967">However, the settlement was opposed by Mobil by another major producer in the area, in some small details by other producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.231" offset="1805688">It was also opposed by the Public Service Commission for the State of New York, the Municipal Distributors, the American Public Gas Association, the American Public Power Association and the Consumer Federation of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.720" offset="1875592">On December 24, 1970, the Commission issued an order that made the settlement proposal a part of the record and provided that opponents could present in the hearings that were still going on before the hearing examiner, the reasons are basis for their objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.751" offset="1947794">This hearing continued the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.760" offset="1959811">In March 1971, the Examiner’s decision was omitted, briefs were filed directly to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.076" offset="1985097">There was no oral argument and the Commission issued its Opinion number 598, the opinion now here on July 16, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.027" offset="2024908">This adopted the settlement proposal in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.881" offset="2044238">It has specific features that give rise to the issues now raised here by Mobil.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.658" offset="2067331">As to the past, that is this fund of collections prior to August 1, 1971, the Commission adopted a formula set out on the settlement proposal to dispose refund liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.039" offset="2124904">Specific rates were fixed for the past period.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.815" offset="2140056">Amounts collected by individual producers in excess of those rates were not to be refunded, but were to be retained as working capital and subject to future discharge by dedication of new reserves in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.761" offset="2203794">As to the future, that is the period after August 1, 1971, the Commission adopted precisely a two-part rate structure that was set out in the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.558" offset="2251024">Rates were prescribed for flowing gas that is rates for -- sales under contracts dated prior to October 1, 1968, a fixed escalation in October, 1973 was provided and a system was included for contingent escalations up to a total of 1.5 cents, up to 1977, if by that time the industry as a whole dedicates certain specified quantities of new gas in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.133" offset="2393234">But on one of the points we raise here, that contingent escalation formula excludes from the reserves that will be counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.692" offset="2435553">The reserves that are used by individual companies to discharge their own refund liabilities and it requires those of us such as Mobil, which have small refund liabilities to in effect earn these escalations which are then allowed for all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.644" offset="2507337">The rate structure also includes a separate rate for new gas, that is sales on the contract dated after October 1, 1968 and a moratorium on increases in rates under Section 4 of the Act, extending to October 1, 1976 for flowing gas and October 1, 1977 for the new gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.958" offset="2604617">Other provisions that we have raised and discussed in our briefs were included, precisely as set out in the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.337" offset="2642129">The opponents of the settlement sought rehearing as required by Section 19 (a) of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.349" offset="2674103">This was denied by Commission Opinion 598-A in which the Commission reiterated that it adopted this settlement proposal in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.208" offset="2713600">Review in the Fifth Circuit followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.351" offset="2722168">The Commission’s opinion was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.815" offset="2735961">In August 1973, however, the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the Commission as to an identical rate structure which the Commission had imposed in the Texas Gulf Coast area, finding essential elements of this rate structure in conflict with the standards of Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.613" offset="2823210">The proceedings in this Court then followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.515" offset="2834808">Now the issue is raised by Mobil go both to what we term the invalid end result, impact and consequences, in this case under the standards that this Court set out in the Hope test in 1944 and in its review of the first area rate case, the Permian Basin decision in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.081" offset="2933029">The issues we raise also go to the invalidity of essential elements of this rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.922" offset="2960405">In our view, the District of Columbia Circuit Opinion which is before this Court is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.096" offset="2989140">This structure violates express standards of Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act which prohibit unjust and unreasonable rates and also prohibit unduly discriminatory and unduly preferential rate structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.907" offset="3064372">In addition, as our briefs indicate, there are substantial parts of the Commission’s opinion in this case which do not include any of the findings that this Court indicated in both Hope and in Permian are required for valid rates under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.703" offset="3143576">Now in particulars as to our view on the discriminatory and preferential nature of this rate structure, it begins with this treatment of refunds for the past period and it carries on from that over into the rates prescribed for present and future.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.501" offset="3242736">By the treatment of refunds, the Commission has in effect in this case, adopted a rate structure which prefers the producers who in the past collected the highest rates, who did not follow Commission guidelines and policies between 1960 and 1968, it provides those producers additional and special working capital available in the present and in the future for use in competitive bidding and other operations and this same formula is tied to the flowing gas rates that were fixed here for the present and the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.373" offset="3402292">We cite in our briefs specific parts of the Commission’s opinion which reflect that the Commission treated its present and future allowance for exploration and development capital and the other capital allowances in the flowing gas rates as in part satisfied by this special allowance of working capital to the few producers who owed the large refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.069" offset="3508976">As we cited in our brief, they are quite disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.064" offset="3529038">They do not or not proportional among producers in the area and only a handful of the producers owe the bulk of the refunds, but under this rate structure, both as to past, present and future, the incentives and the benefits the Commission has allowed or channeled straight to those three producers and they are not allowed to the remaining producers in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.362" offset="3642201">Now --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="892.221" offset="3645649">What is to be the effect Mr. Gilliam upon the consumer, I take it they feel that the refund system will what, penalize the old consumer and help the current one?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carroll_l_gilliam" startTime="906.336" stopTime="1278.058">
            <label>Mr. Carroll L. Gilliam</label>
            <text syncTime="906.336" offset="3702073">Your Honor, of course Mr. Morrow will address this question from the viewpoint of the consumers, but in the District of Columbia Circuit opinion, the opinion notes that this is adverse both to the interests of producers in the area who are old producers such as Mobil and adverse to new entrants and adverse to the competitive structure in the area, and therefore, would be adverse to the ultimate benefits that consumers should expect in the sense of the two objectives of the statute which are reasonable rates and an adequate supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.991" offset="3888692">Now the analysis of that in the Texas Gulf opinion, from the District of Columbia Circuit is quite detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.492" offset="3918681">We rely on that quite heavily and I think it does cover this problem which we raise of undue discrimination and preference both from the viewpoint of the affected producer and from the view point of the ultimate consumer and in that opinion, the basis for the opinion by the District of Columbia Circuit, rested of course on the statutory standard, but on the adverse impact on both of the most affected interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.351" offset="4050129">Now in the analysis of this rate structure, everything for present and future that we attack is being too low or not a high enough reasonable rate, not high enough current allowance at 1969 and 1971 cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.703" offset="4119510">Everything was justified all along the way by ah yes, but we made those allowances in the treatment of refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.147" offset="4157336">But then when you look at that, those allowances go in only a few directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.990" offset="4180741">Those who follow the past policy are somewhat left out in the cold so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.429" offset="4202475">It even comes in the opinion before the Fifth Circuit on the moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.404" offset="4222328">In the Permian case, this Court spelled out certain things the Commission should find when it imposes a moratorium on rate increases such as projected stability of cost, trends as to rising cost, on this instance, it would have been looking towards the 70s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.965" offset="4300591">Here we have only five lines in the Commission opinion which establish a moratorium from August 1971 to 1976 and 1977 in one of the nation’s most critical areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.545" offset="4362971">There is not one word in those five lines about whether cost could be expected to rise, whether capital requirements would be greater or so on and yet the Fifth Circuit opinion, in looking at our objection to that and comparing it with what this Court said in Permian, the Fifth Circuit says ah yes but somehow that is compensated for by the refund allowances that were permitted under this rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.050" offset="4488986">But I would suggest that is no compensation to those producers who did not collect those rates in the past and it's an intermixture, an intertwined effort to tie together a rate structure to protect refund liabilities for a handful of companies, but in so doing, the Commission has mixed it up with what should be current and future just and reasonable rates for the entire area industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.561" offset="4630988">It has used that also to lay down a moratorium on the whole area and has done it in a period when even this record which cut off in 1971 indicated that we already were in a natural gas shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.981" offset="4700682">It indicated that the heaviest demands for capital on this industry that have ever existed would arise in the 1970s and when the drilling effort, increasingly, must be directed toward greater offshore distances, deeper drilling and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.963" offset="4788558">Now with that, we have the Commission simply adopting a rate structure that in our view was tailor-made to benefit only a handful of people who had collected as we say the highest rates from 1960 to 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.948" offset="4868493">There are other issues that we have raised that deal with particular parts of the settlement agreement, one of them I have mentioned, the moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.488" offset="4910707">We also have brought the question of the Commission’s refusal to make an adequate allowance for our royalty payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.087" offset="4945084">In Southern Louisiana, the producer’s payments of royalty to others, including governmental institutions are some 16% of total revenues and the Commission has put together a rate structure here that (a) it was based on an assumption years ago that its own rate jurisdiction extended to control of the level of royalty payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.443" offset="5050514">That assumption by the Commission some years ago was held to be invalid and yet the Commission still is prescribing rates on the assumption that the royalty payment is controlled or a function of the rate fixed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.750" offset="5111745">We have submitted that the Commission erred in not allowing an adjustment pause in the rates where if the producer is required to pay government or someone on market value that that escalation be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.959" offset="5172558">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.024" offset="6228846">The Commission in Opinion 546 which is Southern Louisiana 1, in 1968 made findings as to the just and reasonable rates for gas in the Southern Louisiana area and these findings related to gas from 1954, the inception of producer regulation up through 1968, the date of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.803" offset="6315990">Finding that the producers had charged excessive rates, this Commission ordered refunds, the amount of which approximated $376 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.919" offset="6360398">Three years later, in Opinion number 598 which is now under review and which I refer to as Southern Louisiana 2, the Commission reopened its final order in the 1968 docket, which had been affirmed on appeal and modified two elements of the costs found in that document, modified them retroactively and since it modified those cost items retroactively and increased them, that of course had an effect upon the refunds which it had ordered in the other case and so it drastically modified its 1968 refund order, reducing it at one fell of swoop by $226 million and then providing for the work off of the remaining $150 million by dedications of gas by the producers to interstate commerce in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.534" offset="6578887">Now, our proposition in this case, the basic legal proposition is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.129" offset="6601247">The Commission had no power by its 1971 order to reopen a final judicially affirmed 1968 order and modify the fact findings in that final 1968 Order and change the refunds relating to the 1954 to 1968 [Voice Overlap].</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.524" offset="7898802">If it had not been a final order then I presume it would not have been a final order Your Honor that’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.692" offset="7919491">But this was a final order and the Commission defended it before the Court of Appeals as a final order and successfully defended every single finding in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.369" offset="7962227">Now what the Court of Appeals did was first to affirm, because it says we have to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.225" offset="7989603">The Commission’s opinion is based solidly on evidence in the record and we have no choice, but to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.617" offset="8023249">It then went on to say that with respect to this lawful order, we make, it says we rely upon the broad remedial powers that in here in the Court of Equity and for acting pursuant to its equitable powers stated, we make it part of the remedy in this case that the authority of the Commission to reopen any part of its orders is left intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.083" offset="8137038">Now our position is very simply, that if the Commission order was lawful in all respects, there was no basis for the Court of Appeals to provide a remedy, a judicial equitable remedy for a perfectly lawful order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.622" offset="8211226">Once the Court of Appeals found that the Commission order was substantially supported by facts and findings in the record, its jurisdiction was at an end with respect to that order and this Court said so in Natural Gas Pipeline versus F.P.C. which is cited in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.766" offset="8279771">The Court said this, referring to the Court’s review of the Commission order, “Once a fair hearing has been given, proper findings made and other statutory requirements satisfied the courts can not intervene, in the absence of a clear showing that the limits of due process have been overstepped.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.906" offset="8356362">And again this Court, in SEC versus Chenery Corporation said that it’s the duty of a reviewing court, that the duty of a reviewing court “is that an end when it becomes evident that the Commission’s action is based upon substantial evidence and is consistent with the authority granted by Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.054" offset="8440999">This is the crucial distinction between this case and the Ford Motor case and all the other cases that are cited along that line by the Commission and the intervenors in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.878" offset="8488229">In the Ford motor case, the agency had committed legal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.057" offset="8509022">Someone’s rights had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.154" offset="8521352">A wrong, a legal wrong had been perpetrated and this called upon the equity powers of the court, the remedial powers of the court to provide a remedy for the wrong, to provide relief for someone who had received legal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.198" offset="8597525">In the present case or rather in Southern Louisiana 1, there was no legal wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.759" offset="8623752">The Commission’s opinion was affirmed in all respects upon the special request of the Commission, and therefore, the Court had no power under the Natural Gas Act, as part of its reviewing power under the Natural Gas Act, it had no power to go ahead and provide a legal equitable remedy, judicial equitable remedy for a perfectly lawful order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.672" offset="8723435">But if the Commission had no power to change that order which was perfectly lawful, then it certainly had no power to use its equitable remedial rights to invest such an unprecedented power in the Federal Power Commission.</text>

            <label>Mr. George E. Morrow</label>
            <text syncTime="2222.936" offset="8968464">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.824" offset="8972016">That’s what the Court purported to do and it’s our position that the Court simply could not do both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.401" offset="8998348">It cannot affirm and at the same time provide a judicial equitable remedy for perfectly valid order and that is what it purported to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.816" offset="9040039">Now there is -- the New York Commission emphasizes this point that in that Southern Louisiana 1, the Court had carefully and exhaustively reviewed every single fact finding of the Commission and it had affirmed every fact finding of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.557" offset="9118929">And regardless of how you construe the Commission’s final order in the case, it is not reasonable to construe it as having the Court say we just reviewed all of these facts and costs, we affirm them all, now Federal Commission go and change them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.112" offset="9189146">In other words, if the Court was leaving anything open validly in the Southern Louisiana 1 case, it was leaving open matters with respect to non-cost additives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.424" offset="9242436">But that brings us to the second leg of our case, of our position here, and that is that even if the Commission’s reopening of its 1968 opinion were lawful, the manner in which it did so is totally, totally unsupported on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.900" offset="9312340">This is not just a matter of conflicting findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.690" offset="9323520">This is a matter of a mis-analysis of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.631" offset="9339298">The sole basis upon which the Commission made its change in the 1968 refund order was on its finding in the 1971 case that it had committed error, factual error in the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.754" offset="9407739">The Commission said, Opinion 546 did not afford an adequate return and it understated the requirements for exploration and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.057" offset="9444937">In the light of these inadequacies, the Commission said, we find that the rights of 20.625 cents and 21 and a quarter cents as a based for refunds are reasonable and in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.370" offset="9494256">So the only basis for the finding as to the refunds was that the 1968 Order was in error with respect to rate of return and allocation of exploration and development costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.492" offset="9558727">The rate of -- but the court -- the fallacy here is that the Commission never reviewed its 1968 record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.318" offset="9594044">It never went back to determine whether the fact findings in that record were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.359" offset="9614211">What it did was to use its findings in the new case, its rate of return based on the 1971 decision and using the economic conditions and the capital conditions of the 1971 decision, defined the of rate of return there and it took that rate of return and said because this is higher, this is 13 to 16%, therefore, we find that the 12% rate of return that we ordered in the 1968 opinion is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.599" offset="9751092">And it is our contention that the rate of return in the second case is no evidence as to the inadequacy of the rate of return in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.622" offset="9791216">The same thing is true with the other cost element which is a major cost element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.249" offset="9805740">The allocation of costs is between a Dry Hole Cost or exploration and development costs between oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.872" offset="9848268">It used a new method in Southern Louisiana 2, but it never applied that method to the costs in Southern Louisiana 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.543" offset="9890900">So regardless of the result that it reached in Southern Louisiana 2, it could not use that result as evidence that it had been wrong, erroneous or inadequate in Southern Louisiana 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.239" offset="9937711">So there was no evidence to support the Court, the Commission’s changing of its rates in the earlier opinion, and therefore, no evidence to support the change of its refunds in that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.989" offset="10000718">I haven't had a chance to get into the escalation provisions which, as I say the first one-half cent escalation provision amounts to $400 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.116" offset="10053172">There are three additional escalation measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.050" offset="10068950">Now, Mobil in its brief has discussed in great detail the discriminatory aspects of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.054" offset="10100924">I only want to say this about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.071" offset="10109074">There is no evidence whatsoever in the Commission’s opinion to support them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.219" offset="10133629">There is no evidence or that there is going to be anything like that kind of fact, of cost increase in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.592" offset="10167066">This gas is the gas that has already been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.740" offset="10179709">This gas, they have already had the lease costs, the dry hole cost, the drilling cost, all of the costs have been expended in the past except the cost of sitting there and letting the gas flow from the well bore into the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.094" offset="10237074">And as New York points out in its brief those cash cost actually decreased between 1968 and 1971 and there is no finding in the future that those costs are going to increase in any perceptible degree and no conceivable possibility that those costs will increase in the realm of hundreds of millions of dollars, as is involved in these half-cent increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.278" offset="10321816">The Commission never made any findings as to how much good these half-cent increases were going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.631" offset="10351282">Whether they were needed, in the first place and if they were needed, there was no balancing of the hundreds of millions of costs versus the probable new reserves that will be gotten as a result of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.627" offset="10407288">So this is what disturbed Judge Leventhal too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.745" offset="10427768">Judge Leventhal, addressing this precise issue in the Texas Gulf Coast case concluded that since the rates for new gas had been expressly found by the Commission to be adequate, alone, the rates for new gas alone and to induce capital investment in the area, there was no basis for an extra allowance to rates for old gas to accomplish all over again identically the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.822" offset="10528078">Your Honor, I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.004" offset="10564754">Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.276" offset="10577816">I would like first of all to take a little time to give a chronological resume of what happened in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.722" offset="10607595">It may duplicate certain things that have been said before, but I think it gives a better perspective on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.847" offset="10632150">The first Southern Louisiana case was initiated in 1961 and was decided in 1968, shortly after this Court’s affirmance of the Commission in the Permian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.471" offset="10682619">The rates established in that proceeding were based on 1960 costs and were lower than the guideline and inline rates which the Commission had previously established for Southern Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.444" offset="10734550">The Commission devoted very little discussion to the gas supply situation, but concluded that its rates would induce adequate supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.330" offset="10770077">It said that findings to production and reserves to production ratios were not significant in helping to determine reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.212" offset="10809574">Among the many applications for rehearing presented to the Commission was one by the pipeline purchasers group that indicated they were having difficulty purchasing sufficient supplies of gas to meet their customer’s demands and that the rates were inadequate to increase that supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.932" offset="10884493">While the Commission denied rehearing, it recognized the inadequacy of the cost and reserve data, particularly that with respect to the offshore federal domain area of Southern Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.041" offset="10944888">Accordingly, it lifted the indefinite moratorium that it had imposed on price increases in that area to the extent necessary to permit certain limited increased rate filings, for gas sold under contracts dated after October 1, 1968 and it limited the moratorium on similar onshore sales to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.820" offset="11036003">At the same time, it instituted a new proceeding which was to reexamine the rate for offshore Southern Louisiana, establish a new just and reasonable rate for that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.471" offset="11090651">This was the beginning of South Louisiana 2, the case which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.054" offset="11120953">Later that same year they expanded the proceeding so that it encompassed the entire area involved in the First Southern Louisiana case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.725" offset="11167660">In September of 1969, before this case, the first Southern Louisiana 1 was submitted to the Court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.869" offset="11200261">The staff of the Federal Power Commission issued a report, indicating the national gas supply situation had deteriorated, the reserves to production ratio and the findings to production ratios had declined sharply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.268" offset="11261806">They concluded that unless aggressive action was taken to increase the finding of gas, supplies would soon not be adequate to meet demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.210" offset="11305587">They pointed out that the findings in 1968 were less than production and that there would probably be regional supply deficiencies as early as 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.718" offset="11355638">They were much too optimistic because early as late fall of 1970, one or more pipelines were curtailing supplies of gas to firm customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.922" offset="11408405">In its review of South Louisiana 1, the Court below indicated its misgivings with respect to the Commission’s consideration of the supply situation and their lack of any attention to the reserves to production or findings to production ratios.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.463" offset="11490638">However, they felt that with the presently pending South Louisiana proceeding, now before the Commission that it would serve little purpose to remand or to reverse or to set aside the order which was before them since the same thing was being investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.183" offset="11573499">They said, however that it’s possible that the Commission may find it advisable to immediately modify its order or it might set aside the order affirmed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.028" offset="11616862">They said the Commission has the power to take these actions if it finds them appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.291" offset="11641940">Petitions for rehearing were filed with the Court and it was argued that the Commission had no authority to set aside orders which they had finally issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.597" offset="11679138">And the Commission itself, in response to request from the Court said we have no authority to make retrospective changes in rates which we have established and which are finally affirmed unless this Court tells us that we can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.401" offset="11738384">And in its order on rehearing, the Court made this and I wish to quote this statement, “We wish to make crystal clear the authority of –-</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.061" offset="12649012">Indeed it was, Your Honor, it was the primary issue that was raised before the Court at that time under the petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.576" offset="12679001">Under Section 19 (b) of the Natural Gas Act, the Court of Appeals of course has authority to set aside an order in the whole or in part or it could order additional evidence to be heard by the Commission upon such terms and conditions as it deems proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.245" offset="12749740">Now the Court below was greatly troubled by the Commission’s failure to discuss supply and demand and its lack of concern with the reserve and the finding ratios.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.694" offset="12791536">They felt that the decisions with respect to the validity of Southern Louisiana 1 should be made by the Commission who made the original decision because they have the data which indicated what the supply situation was and only they had the expertise to evaluate that data and to evaluate the impact of the Southern Louisiana 1 rates on supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.413" offset="12902400">It seems to us that it is entirely consistent that this Court’s opinion in the Ford Motor Company case, that Courts of Appeals in these instances are vested with equity powers and that, as the Court said in that case, while the Court must act within the bounds of the statute and without intruding upon the administrative province, it may adjust its relief’s to the exigencies of the case in accordance with equitable principles governing judicial actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.789" offset="13019951">We think that is what the Court below did in this case and gave the Commission the authority to reopen its previous order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.751" offset="13059762">If that is true, the argument made by certain of the petitioners, that the Commission was granting reparations by its order in this case obviously is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.651" offset="13107304">Now the second legal issue concerns compliance by the Commission with the three criteria established by this Court for review in the Permian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.836" offset="13152131">One, did the Commission’s order abuse or exceed its authority?</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.317" offset="13169998">Two, were each of the order’s essential elements supported by substantial evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.895" offset="13192359">And three, can the order be expected to maintain financial integrity, attract necessary capital and fairly compensate investors for the risks they have assumed and yet provide appropriate protection to the relevant public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.102" offset="13257143">Now as had been the Court’s concern in Southern Louisiana 1, Commission’s concern in Southern Louisiana 2 was directed to the supply situation of gas and the demand for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.697" offset="13315553">The Commission pointed out the steady decline in both the reserves to production and the findings production ratios and stated that their minimum objective in the case was to halt the downward trend of the reserved production ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.311" offset="13382008">They pointed out that the estimated demand in South Louisiana would increase from an annual figure of six trillion cubic feet per year to nine-and-a-half trillion cubic feet in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.846" offset="13440104">And in this connection, this Court said in Permian, we do not suggest nor did the Commission that the Commission should not continuously assess the level and success of exploration or that the relationship between the reserves and production is not a useful benchmark of the industry’s future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.929" offset="13520457">Now the Commission indicated that it was unable to quantify the volumes of gas which would be elicited by a particular rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.775" offset="13555879">But they did find that there was a strong positive relationship between price and supply or exploratory effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.599" offset="13595167">They also pointed out that capital formation for gas exploration and development had been declining since 1957 and that the industry’s capital requirements had increased and that the cost of producing gas have continued to climb.</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.813" offset="13771964">I think that you should look at the general result of the Commission’s rate order to find out that if the ultimate conclusions the Commission arrived at were appropriate and reasonable, but not to weigh the evidence as the Court of Appeals was required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.252" offset="13865796">Now in an attempt to meet the problems of declining supply and inadequate capital formation, the Commission approved a rate design-formula which encompassed several facets, all of which were directed to in an attempt to increase the supply of gas available to the consumers in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.556" offset="13954926">This formula included base area rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.286" offset="13969868">It included fixed and contingent escalations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.257" offset="13985750">It included refund write off provisions and each part of the rate design was directed to the problems facing the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.028" offset="14028904">The rate design had to function for the entire area and apply to many producers in differing circumstances and the record show that the industry had placed great reliance and had expanded internally generated funds to finance its exploratory efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.811" offset="14111974">The basic finding that the Commission made was that a portion of the funds required for further exploration and development in South Louisiana will be generated by the increased cash flow from the higher rates for flowing gas and to further the operation of the contingent escalation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.647" offset="14191386">Flowing gas resources represent an important source of capital to the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.001" offset="14212702">The additional resources from a higher new gas rates and the escalations allowed will also contribute to the total of needed capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.743" offset="14247706">Now in their approach to designing these, the Commission felt that they could not and should not be restricted to encouraging increased supply solely by one method and that was by the area rates which they established, particularly, the rates for new gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.508" offset="14326805">However, they discussed, as they had, as had been done in Permian the cost -- current cost data which was before the Commission in the determination of the new gas rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.432" offset="14382498">They indicated that the lack of precision in these costs and the difficulties involved in making allocation procedures made it desirable that they indicate a range of costs based on reliable and credible data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.648" offset="14451357">As a matter of fact, this Court, in a footnote in the Permian case said that by one estimate, the costs of non-associated gas are 45% separate, 31% joint and 24% common.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.385" offset="14506318">So they are great areas for differences and judgment with respect to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.645" offset="14523350">Accordingly, they examined the cost data and established what they considered a range of reasonable costs and utilize as step witness presentation with that in that respect who had recommended a rate of 25 cents per MCF.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.536" offset="14598896">In order to be assured that there would be enough in this to encourage additional supplies, the Commission indicated that the rates for -- the cost for least acquisition and for drilling were all going up and they should be increased slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.403" offset="14670367">They approved a rate as found just and reasonable for 26 cents and said it should operate to elicit additional supplies of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.879" offset="14712268">It used a similar method for flowing gas to that which was approved by this Court in the Permian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.527" offset="14742883">The only difference was that they had a direct assignment of exploration development cost because there was evidence in the record which justified that use and it approved to settlement rate of 22 and 38 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.933" offset="14808503">The Commission however, at the same time pointed out that under this traditional old gas costing method that the exploration and development allowance too often indicates the cost of exploration under past periods rather than the current increased cost and it added a non-cost component to the old gas rate to increase the cash flow to producers for an increased exploration development effort.</text>

            <text syncTime="4349.499" offset="17474769">But this is a situation wholly different again as this Court pointed out in Permian where the gas producing industry is entirely different situation than the ordinary public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.716" offset="17551569">One other item and the third leg of the Commission’s attempt to increase gas supply were the contingent escalation provisions which were definitely key to new dedications of gas in Southern Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.851" offset="17620114">By that provision if after refunds have been paid off producers dedicated up to 15 trillion cubic feet of gas, there could be increased rates as higher as the cent and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.441" offset="17682495">Now, the refund write-off provisions were completely taken care of, the contingent escalations were completely taken care of, there would be 30 trillion cubic feet of gas supplied for the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.575" offset="17743099">I would like to comment about one other thing and that is the argument that there was discrimination as between producers because some of them had earlier settled their obligations and would have much lesser refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.043" offset="17808927">In connection for instance with petitioner Mobile Oil Company, they made a settlement in 1964 in which they were excused from refunds of approximately $14 million and subsequently when a moratorium which they proposed in their settlement had expired they chose to continue with those rates and not make any additional filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.439" offset="17918537">Now these were management determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.437" offset="17934524">These were things that if they wanted to make a settlement in 1964 and get their $14 million then, if they chose not to make increased rate filings in which they were no moratoria, that was entirely up to them and did not require this Commission to take all of those aspects in the consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.871" offset="18020206">But what they tried to do was to make broad general rules covering all of producers in this wide area, but primarily in an attempt to bring forth additional supplies of gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="4581.337" offset="18402116">And your question ties to the point that I wanted to make and call the Court’s Attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.543" offset="18422909">To that portion of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion on appeal on rehearing where the court indicated and this is after the 428 F. 2d 445, that their disposition of the case was influenced by the existence of a new proceeding which the Commission itself had already committed and their specific statement was that, in fact the existence of the new proceedings which as we understand then will take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.307" offset="18545998">Many of the issues whose absence has concerned us here has been one of the factors we have considered in deciding to affirm the Commission’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.962" offset="18588630">Now and that’s into the court and I think that the important thing about this is to tie into this Court’s opinion in the Ford Motor Company case where the Court regarded as a contention without substance whether the Court below, Court of Appeals set aside the opinion or whether it allowed the agency there, the NLRB to set aside the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.486" offset="18690717">And the Court characterized the contention on that ground as one without substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.586" offset="18711092">And this is a situation I think where the Court of Appeals found the Federal Power Commission in an error of transition because to read the two opinions of the Court -- the Commission side by side reflects an enormously different outlook about the gas supply situation in this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.499" offset="18794789">In the first opinion, there was little or no concern by Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.267" offset="18809835">In the second opinion three years later, it had become virtually an overriding consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.171" offset="18837420">Turning if I might next to the questions with respect to the refund discharge and the questions raised by you Mr. Justice White, I think it’s very necessary in looking both of the refund discharge and contingent escalation question to start at the beginning of the book and not in the middle of the book as petitioners have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.321" offset="18938044">The beginning of the book is this Court’s analysis in Memphis and Mobile in the early 1960 of the function of Sections 4 and 5 and there the Court pointed out that this is a punitive sort of regulation in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.223" offset="19005649">The buyers and sellers, the parties who have regulated start out in the first instance with individual contracts which they make according to their own evaluations of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.351" offset="19054132">Then superimposed on top of that becomes the regulatory powers of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.733" offset="19079732">Now, this I think is the source of a good deal of the argument and confusion with respect to the refund write-offs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.001" offset="19108780">What this Commission was working on in the Southern Louisiana case was a multitude of contracts by multitude of parties that had been negotiated and entered into at variety of different levels.</text>

            <text syncTime="4917.964" offset="19748571">And I wish I could get to some of the questions that were bothering you Mr. Justice White [Laughter Attempt] and I think perhaps there’s one or two key elements here and that is that the Commission while it did indicate its view that the refund floors which it had established for a past period were just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.416" offset="19834462">It went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.153" offset="19841358">It expressed the opinion that the formula -- the formula I am reading from page 5 -- 654 of volume 2 of the appendix, that the formula for determining the refund obligations during this period is found to be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.176" offset="19901440">So I think you have to accept the Commission’s view that it was dealing with a range of costs, old and new and that there is a zone of reasonableness for just and reasonable rates not a single .2 decimal place estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.919" offset="19968418">Now, carrying the fixed amount of refund obligations forward as to its impact on the individual producers, I would come in to your reading very strongly the brief filed by intervenor Associated Gas Distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.333" offset="20034038">There is a large group of distribution companies who took very active part in this case and they expressed the whole problem very, very well I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.258" offset="20069773">Throughout producer regulation from the very first the Commission has been confronted with this confounding problem of trying to link together a certain price in a certain volume of gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="5014.318" offset="20134034">It is inherent in the nature of an industry that extends the bulk of its exploratory moneys for unsuccessful project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.880" offset="20172278">The producers in general every year expend in the neighborhood of $1 billion on what are unsuccessful projects, mostly dry holes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.401" offset="20206341">There’s just no way that you can link a specific price to two decimals to a specific volume of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.950" offset="20232568">The Commission has recognized this and so did the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="5246.689" offset="21063471">But I wanted to call the Court’s attention to the fact that most of the refunds and this shows on page 277, volume 5 that are required by the present opinion all in the late years the late 60s and early 70s and this is why it was most appropriate for the Commission to focus on its cost computation made as of the test year 1969 not to test year 1960 which it had earlier used and if you recall Mobil described, Mobil’s counsel described before you the process of individual companies settlements through the mid 60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.256" offset="21221773">And these settlements themselves had eliminated most of the refund obligations by making refunds through the early late 50s and early 60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.665" offset="21259389">So we would like to most appropriate that the Commission now looks at the 1969 test year for the derivation of its present refund obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.464" offset="21302648">One additional point I think should be made in this respect and it ties back to the Court’s decision in the second Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.057" offset="21332950">You recall that Mr. Forquer pointed out that a staff witness in the second part of the case made the finding and a recommendation that no refunds at all should be required because the revenues received during that period were less than his cost estimates on an aggregate basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.486" offset="21414661">And this is precisely the reason that in Phillips too this Court affirmed the Commission for not requiring refunds of that company in a similar revenue cost position, and in our view this finding gave the Commission the power to utilize this refund obligation as a supply eliciting factor in its overall rate design.</text>

            <label>Mr. George E. Morrow</label>
            <text syncTime="5399.344" offset="21674109">That case used of virtually identically the same or settlement provision that this case has used, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.477" offset="21706606">So it was modeled directly after this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.928" offset="21720503">They both got to stand afoul it seems to me and we suggest that the general result that Mr. Forquer was said that the Court used there, what’s the general overall result, that’s not the proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.781" offset="21767837">This Court has said that each essential element of the cost of service must be supported by evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.527" offset="21790824">And we contend that it’s not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.076" offset="21801064">Now, as to the matter that Your Honor raised Justice White, as to the discretion of the Commission to order refunds, we treated that right strongly in our reply brief and would commend that to your attention because we take the position that the Commission has no discretion to allow a company to remain unjustly enriched by unlawful exactions from its customers, particularly under an Act that’s supposed to give complete permanent and effective bond of protection to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.495" offset="21934707">As to the compromise -- as to the $150 million of refunds, I must take issue with Mr. Forquer as to how that was arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.428" offset="21970442">It was pulled right square out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.656" offset="21983399">It was a result of settlement negotiations and after that $150 million figure had been reached, then the Commission started building a floor of cost under it to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.548" offset="22026971">And it couldn’t find the cost in its cost of service to support that reduction to a $150 million and that’s why the Commission went back to 1968 and remodeled its 1968 opinion and all -- and it did so by using a different kind of cost allocation method in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.797" offset="22119967">The cost allegation method which the Commission used in this case was one it had rejected in every other case it’s ever had of producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.032" offset="22152882">The only reason that this cost allocation method was used in this case was to jack up retroactively the cost in Southern Louisiana 1, so that they would meet this package deal that had been presented to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.369" offset="22218188">If it please the Court, the thing that's basically wrong with this case is that we have a serious question here, a serious problem and the Commission and it demands a rational well thought out result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.925" offset="22272418">And what the Commission has done has abdicated its responsibility to a kind of regulation by negotiation by the industry itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.483" offset="22310661">And with respect to the refund -- with respect to the whole thing, you got a negotiation between selling parties who are the producers controlling virtually the entire supply of gas in Southern Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.139" offset="22365309">And buying parties, the pipelines and the distributors who had desperate for gas must to get it from these producers and can resell it at any rate that the producers proposed to sell it to them for and who have no interest in the refunds whatsoever because as Mr. Rebman pointed out the pipelines don’t keep them, they pass them along to the distributors and the distributors do not keep them there, the state regulatory agencies make them passed along.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.098" offset="22477113">So the negotiations that resulted in this $150 million worth of refunds were by people who were negotiating with other people’s money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.629" offset="22519223">And that is how they got down to the $150 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.107" offset="22537195">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
