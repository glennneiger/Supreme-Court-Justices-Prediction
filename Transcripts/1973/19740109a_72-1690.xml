            <text syncTime="19.387" offset="154331">I think to give some perspective to the question before the Court this morning, I will relate a piece of history that I learned just in the last week involving President Lincoln’s favorite clown, it was discussed in an article that appeared in the New York Times Magazine of December 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.461" offset="230609">The clown in question was named Dan Rice and he dressed himself up in an outfit that was designed to look like the American flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.105" offset="261120">It was in a reverent expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.574" offset="271047">I think in the tradition of people like Mr. Goguen whose case was argued only recently before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.460" offset="298632">Mr. Rice called himself Uncle Sam and the image which he conveyed has remained with us in various forms and I think its fair to say that Uncle Sam has been in cartoons and at the head of parades, a violator repeatedly of the kind of statute which is before the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.926" offset="380447">This case comes here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Washington and my client, Harold Spence was convicted for flying a privately owned American flag with a black cape peace symbol, superimposed on it from the window of his apartment in Seattle, Washington.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="119.802" offset="555990">Mr. Greenfield, did I sense somewhere in the record that the flag was also upside down?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_greenfield" startTime="126.945" stopTime="333.703">
            <label>Mr. Peter Greenfield</label>
            <text syncTime="126.945" offset="584516">I’m not sure whether that appears in the record Mr. Justice Blackmun, but in fact was suspended upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.304" offset="605936">That does not constitute a violation of the statute here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.780" offset="627879">As I understand it, an upside down flag is traditionally a symbol of distress and I think it was consistent with the message which Mr. Spence was attempting to convey.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.605" offset="663197">However he was not convicted as a result of the position of the flag but merely because there was something superimposed on the flag and that something could have been under the broadly word at statute of our state, words such as I love America, the content would not have been of consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.622" offset="751282">This case doesn’t have any of the complicating features that some recent political protest cases have, that have been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.940" offset="788480">It doesn’t involve as the Tinker case did.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.684" offset="799451">The black arm bands that were worn in a school room, that the location, that was across of some concern unlike the Papish case, the political cartoon that was published on college campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.031" offset="844904">It doesn’t involve any question of the right of (Inaudible) campuses to state or regulate activity on college campuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.543" offset="870922">It doesn’t involve any trespass on private or public property or any destruction of property or Government records as was the case in United States versus O’Brien.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.786" offset="907912">The only factor which makes this case at all complicated or indeed at all interest in this that it involved an American flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.685" offset="943438">And as to whether or not that makes the case difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.275" offset="957858">I would remind the Court of the observation of Mt. Justice Jackson in West Virginia versus Barnette, that is that the underlying principles arising out of the First Amendment are simple ones and it's only -- the only problem on a case like this is going beyond the emotional preconceptions that we have when our flag is involved in getting to those fundamental and basically simple principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.588" offset="1075096">Basically, there are two kinds of statutes that are currently the subject of a great deal of litigation throughout the country, criminal statutes promulgated by the states and referring to flags.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.998" offset="1124728">They are the desecration statutes, the kind of statute that were -- was at issue in the Goguen case which punishes behavior which reflects some kind of contempt or intentional desecration of the flag either by words or by some other form of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.651" offset="1195363">That kind of statute is not at issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.173" offset="1209469">Washington statute which -- under which Mr. Spence was prosecuted deals with what is referred to in the title as “Improper use of the flag.”</text>
            <text syncTime="292.263" offset="1245832">And I should start by saying that the flag is defined very broadly in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.508" offset="1262759">A flag, I believe the definition says flag etcetera defined, refers to any flag, emblem, a shield or color of the United States or of the State of Washington or any picture or representation of the flag of any substance that is of metal or stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.438" offset="1350531">The buttons which have flags on them and have the face of a political candidate are equally punishable under Washington statute as was -- according to the Supreme Court of Washington the conduct engaged in by Mr. Spence.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.186" offset="1409463">And once again --</text>

            <text syncTime="420.254" offset="1757727">Which are in fact much more complicated because judges including Judge Lumbard of Second Circuit in Long Island Moratorium Committee versus Cahn, perhaps the most detailed explication of the statute of this sort and a case that’s pending before this Court, that is the jurisdictional statement that was filed several years ago, suggested that one could not read a statute of this sort literally because the results were too bizarre and consequently we get into something which I think is fair to characterize as symbolic speech as distinguished from literal speech in a statute which presents very serious problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.893" offset="1924284">The kinds of examples which that Chief Judge Lumbard gave of what seemed to him to be obvious violations of the New York statute which is very similar to the Washington statute or such things as the buttons which every presidential candidate in recent history including several chief justices of this Court have displayed that is, pictures of the American flag or part of it with their faces superimposed, it would go to a -- the various magazine covers that have -- almost every magazine of national circulation in the last few years had one or another with a flag or part of it and the title of the magazine in various stories superimposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.350" offset="6670106">If the purpose is to prevent -- to promote respect for the flag, then the statute is overbroad if it prevents a citizen from saying, “I love the flag,” or as one of the exhibits in this court, in this case, exemplified prints in a newspaper, the declaration of independence superimposed on the flag on the occasion of independent state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.085" offset="6769058">This is a plain violation of the statute and its for that reason overbroad, the vagueness argument basically takes off from the proposition that most of the courts who would view these kinds of statutes has said they can’t be taken literally because if they do, they have all these absurd consequences and consequently, one has to guess as to whether this flag constitutes a violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.606" offset="13639158">Well, your friend says that the reason this -- one of the reasons the statute is overbroad is because it would prohibit both of these expressions equally, the favorable and the ambiguous one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.798" offset="13699971">Well, that’s the core part of it but I think Your Honor that it's also appropriate for the Court to consider that using the flag even for the purposes of what one person may consider to be, a benign purpose may be considered by others to be a cause of insult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.810" offset="13803938">As was in this particular case, the ambiguous nature of the symbol in this case could be interpreted either of two ways.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Greenfield</label>
            <text syncTime="3449.656" offset="13875409">Let me just clarify that personal in the sense that Mr. Warme was using it slightly different, I think and personal in the sense in which it was used in Chaplinsky, that is, was the fighting words doctrine involves words directed at a person, not something that one may as a matter of his own feelings finds the troubling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.120" offset="13945208">And let me say in response to Justice Powell’s questions, there are two examples of selected enforcement, and the record in this, Exhibits 1 and 2, one of which is an American flag and a picture with the declaration of independence superimposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.699" offset="14007589">There have been many such examples in the State of Washington and none of them have resulted in prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.424" offset="14034442">The Supreme Court did not narrow, that is the Washington Supreme Court did not narrow the statute in its decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.801" offset="14063909">It simply refused to consider what it regarded as hypothetical examples of rejecting what appellant had asked that it invoked mainly the First Amendment overbreadth argument that would allow other instances to be considered in the statute as overbroad as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.131" offset="14133290">I think also the observation of Mr. Justice White that actually there's no difference between characterizing the Washington Court position as protecting the integrity of the flag and the respect for the flag argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.153" offset="14185326">There isn’t any distinction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.272" offset="14189819">The reason that one that purports to protect the integrity of the flag is to promote its respect otherwise we’re feeling a totally circular argument and if I can --</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.029" offset="14268813">If I can take one more example and I know I have very little time, the respect for the flag argument, I think it was aptly rejected in an analogous case by Thomas Jefferson, it was quoted in the opinion of this Court, the New York Times versus Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.284" offset="14341851">He was making a statement which related to the Sedition Act and he referred to that defunct Act and said that it was a nullity as palpable as if Congress had directed us to fall down on our knees and worship a golden image.</text>

            <text syncTime="3646.682" offset="14663471">Mr. Greenfield, you say in Chaplinsky and of rightly that there -- the it was personally directed to an individual. On the other hand, and Feiner as I recall, Feiner had referred to President Truman as a champagne sipping bomb are words that affect to an audience and the suppression there was not based on remarks, addressed to the individuals but the reaction of the individuals, to remarks about a third person.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Greenfield</label>
            <text syncTime="3672.692" offset="14767543">Well, I think precisely that that the significance of Feiner was that one didn’t simply look at his words because I think Feiner’s words in a different context would have been protected beyond question but it was the fact that there was a crowd that was getting uneasy and that the Court found was about to erupt into violence and that Feiner had been warned to desist and that he refused after three warnings to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.988" offset="14860748">That was what enabled the Court to find there was eminent threat of violence and therefore under the fighting words doctrine, Feiner could be prohibited from continuing with the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.315" offset="14898051">But here the state says it can erect a conclusive presumption that if -- because of the uneducated people of Washington that anyone who sees a flag with God Bless America over it, is likely to respond by violent retaliation and I submit that that’s a simply implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.311" offset="14981956">None of the flag cases that -- in any jurisdiction support in effect a judicial notice by this Court, that the people of this country conform into that degree to the description of harms.</text>
