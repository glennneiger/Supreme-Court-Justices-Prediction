            <label>Mr. James J. Hagan</label>
            <text syncTime="35.716" offset="219638">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.892" offset="236356">These three cases are here on the grant of a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.386" offset="270315">The issue has been limited to the question of whether the Court of Appeals erred in failing to certify the question of Florida law to the Supreme Court of Florida pursuant to its certification statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.428" offset="330501">I will speak for the petitioners in the three cases which have been consolidated for argument and I would ask to reserve three minutes for rebuttal, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.342" offset="378149">It is the position of petitioners here Your Honors that it was error for the Second Circuit to refuse to certify the issue of Florida Law to the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.401" offset="422348">The decision below exemplifies a new doctrine on the Florida law or in fact the law of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.199" offset="457561">Although purporting to find support under the case of Diamond against Oreamuno in the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, the decision below here is in fact a radical extension of the Diamond case.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.088" offset="529136">The question of Florida law here is significant under the public policy of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.443" offset="550557">It involves a Florida corporation and it involves the regulation of that Corporation’s relationship to its fiduciaries and its shareholders and to those who buy and sell its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.805" offset="611997">The decision below adopted a remedy here which could interfere with recovery by shareholders of that Corporation when they sue on an insider trading case.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.664" offset="671451">Therefore, we can believe that in light of the significant question of Florida law and public policy that was involved, the Court of Appeals should have certified the question as it was requested to do by Judge Kaufman in his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.779" offset="735817">Now, Your Honors, I would briefly discuss the underlined facts in this case and the opinions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.126" offset="761208">This case arose out of an alleged misuse of inside information and subsequent insider trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.835" offset="796108">Lum’s Incorporated is a Florida Corporation which was engaged in the fast food franchising business.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.339" offset="830067">During 1969, in the attempt of diversification, it acquired a gambling casino in Las Vegas known as Caesar’s Palace.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.680" offset="867474">And to acquaint the financial community with its new acquisition, it held what it described as a seminar in Caesar’s Palace in November of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.837" offset="912091">Apparently, during that seminar, it released an earning’s forecast of a dollar to a dollar ten cents per share.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.296" offset="949917">Subsequently, in January of 1970, it was alleged and when I make these claims of allegations, I am basically stating the allegations of the Securities and Exchange Commission which filed a complaint for injunctive relief in December 1970, all of the subsequent civil cases are basically copies, if you will, of the SEC complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.317" offset="1046047">It was alleged that one Melvin Chasen, who was the Chief Operating Officer of Lum’s, learned of a decline, substantial decline in the earnings for Lum’s second quarter that he advised a Mr. Benjamin Simon, who was a registered representative employed by Lehman Brothers in its Chicago office of this decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.373" offset="1138207">And that Mr. Simon in turn passed on this information to representatives of Investors Diversified Services in Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.720" offset="1175615">All of these events were alleged to have occurred on January 8 and on January 9, two of the IDS funds sold 83,000 shares of Lum’s stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.850" offset="1232144">Trading was suspended on the 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.532" offset="1242906">Lum’s issued a press release later in the afternoon announcing the decline in its earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.708" offset="1263595">When trading resumed the following Monday, the stock was off $3.00 to $4.00 per share.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.693" offset="1287523">The sales on the previous Friday, had occurred at $17.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.963" offset="1304555">Now the SEC investigated and in the following December, as I said, they filed an injunction action and that was followed by a rash of civil suits and those suits basically fell into two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.558" offset="1362965">One category consisted of derivative actions seeking recovery by Lum's of the trading profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.578" offset="1403089">The second category was a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.485" offset="1418658">Several suits constitute, class actions on behalf of sellers or purchasers of the stock on the day of the trade-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.058" offset="1464947">So at the commencement of the litigation there were three prompts to the regulatory structure: the SEC injunction action, the derivative suits, and the class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.590" offset="1519073">Now, the defendants below moved to dismiss before Judge Tyler, the derivative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.846" offset="1552091">The derivative actions were premised on the rule of Diamond against Oreamuno, which is a New York case and that case briefly stated that officers and directors of a corporation who trade on inside information are required to remit their profits to the corporation even though the corporation has not been damaged in any legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.041" offset="1664940">The court espoused this doctrine in the context of a situation which was really a gross instance of misuse of corporate information The two top officers of the company, MAI had learned of an earnings declined and had sold their own stock at triggering an enormous decline in the price of the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.436" offset="1770475">As the case reached the Court of Appeals in New York, there were no other actions pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.996" offset="1792731">The SEC had not commenced the preceding, Section 16 (b) did not apply because the stock had been held more than six months and there were no class actions or any actions pending by any of the defrauded purchasers of that stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.468" offset="1862635">And so, the argument before the Court of Appeals and strongly urged in the brief by the respondent was that if no remedy is fashioned here, these parties escaped with the illegal profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.158" offset="1937345">That was the context of the Diamond case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.772" offset="1947794">It is the law in New York to the best of our research, it has never been cited or discussed in any decision in any other state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.493" offset="1994710">It’s five years old now.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.741" offset="1999726">It came down in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.036" offset="2012891">So the derivative suits here were premised on the Diamond case, but it was the defendants’ position that it was the Law of Florida that applied to the responsibility of insiders to the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.785" offset="2339840">Just Mr. Chasen.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.989" offset="2344751">Mr. Chasen was an officer and also a director of Lum's.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. James J. Hagan</label>
            <text syncTime="572.486" offset="2366694">Lehman Brothers had no relationship to Lum's.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.639" offset="2379337">It was not its investment advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.411" offset="2386442">It had not done any investment banking for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.275" offset="2397832">It was really without dispute that there was no relationship there.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.481" offset="2418625">IDS -- some of the IDS funds held the stock in its portfolio.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.462" offset="2434612">Other than that, there was no relationship there either.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.584" offset="2447047">So the only conceivable nexus between our case and Diamond was Mr. Chasen.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.899" offset="2472333">Now Judge Tyler as I said, the defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that Florida law applied under the Law of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.765" offset="2495843">You first must show damage to your corporation before derivative suit will lie that even under Diamond, assuming arguendo Diamond applied, there were no profits here on the part of any defendant other than arguably the IDS funds and other than Mr. Chasen who had no profits, there were no fiduciaries involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="630.187" offset="2597512">Mr. Hagan, I take it that it is accepted that Florida law does apply here?</text>

            <label>Mr. James J. Hagan</label>
            <text syncTime="634.580" offset="2615066">Your Honor, in the lower court before Judge Tyler, the defendants argue that Florida law applied but the respondents disputed this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.768" offset="2651847">They argued strenuously before Judge Tyler that New York law applied and they urged that the Diamond rule be imposed and that the rule will be expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.197" offset="2693538">And the expansion of course has to proceed on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.743" offset="2707749">It had to go beyond the officer or director holding of Diamond because that was the holding of Diamond.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.805" offset="2735961">Officers and directors and the rationale was encouragement of private attorneys general to regulate the corporation, it was phrased in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.426" offset="2786429">They also have to go beyond Diamond to pick up parties who hadn't profited because again in Diamond, only the directors who actually profited had been held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.722" offset="2823628">So there were two extensions of Diamond then in an affect that they were urging a rule which really had very little relationship back to the Diamond case although that was the springboard for the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.163" offset="3233437">It was not unclear to the extent that Florida’s law required that you show actual damages to your corporation before derivative suit would lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.131" offset="3277322">The Diamond case in New York, flatly contradicted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.461" offset="3290593">It held no damages -- no damage requirement was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.796" offset="3307938">Secondly, to the extent that Florida had never discussed the Diamond rule, it could have been argued I suppose that it was therefore uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.302" offset="3349943">So to that extent, you could either say that Florida law was settled against the respondents or uncertain because they had never discussed Diamond and one could only speculate what they would do if Diamond was argued to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.692" offset="3403546">But again, even if you argued Diamond on the facts of this case, this is not a Diamond situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.245" offset="4009691">It disregarded, may I say Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it disregarded the four decisions of the Florida intermediate appellate courts on the damage point exemplified by Palma against Zerbey which was 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.406" offset="4066325">It disregarded those in a footnote as not persuasive because there had not been any extensive discussion of the question and there have been a rather conclusionary statement citing earlier opinions and the only analysis of it is in that footnote where the court said it found these cases not persuasive and that was the end of the Florida law as far as the majority opinion below was concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.182" offset="4541440">He found that although -- he decided the question under Diamond out of an abundance of caution and said, even if Diamond, the law of Florida did not apply because none of the party is fit within the Diamond Rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.965" offset="4624614">Now, when the case went up to the Second Circuit, the majority in effect, they did reverse Judge Tyler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.898" offset="4664320">They found that there was no Florida law on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.105" offset="4677172">They believe they had the right to look to the law of other states, specifically New York and the Diamond rule and they then extended the Diamond Rule in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.834" offset="4720118">They extended the concept of the fiduciary beyond the officer and director category to pick up as they put it anyone who receives inside information, becomes ipso facto a fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.320" offset="4786051">Although they did not use the term I suppose, the concept will be something akin to a constructive fiduciary once you receive the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.409" offset="4826384">They then postulated a common enterprise theory and cited certain antitrust cases to support the proposition and then said that as in a conspiracy situation or a joint tort, all of the defendants were liable for the profits of anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.628" offset="4907259">They spent sometime discussing the problems with law of insider trading and the necessity to tighten the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.771" offset="4943830">Judge Kaufman’s dissent agreed of course and there’s no issue here on the condemnation of insider trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.345" offset="4974132">He held however that the majority had invented a totally new concept of law, even under the law of New York, but certainly, it had no basis in Florida law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.643" offset="6847321">As the petitioner has acknowledged this morning the only question before this Court is whether the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit committed reversible error in this action which is based upon diversity jurisdiction in deciding the question of Florida common law, rather than certifying it to the Florida Supreme Court, pursuant to Florida’s optional certification procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.039" offset="6960901">This Court denied the petitioners’ request that it review the merits of this decision or whether the court below violated the principles of Erie against Tompkins in reaching its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.145" offset="7021296">Petitioners, I suggest, no doubt recognizing the weakness of their position on the question which is before this Court had nevertheless argued the merits of this decision at great length in their brief and also this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.123" offset="7093290">Since the merits itself of the decision are not before the Court, I shall not address myself to them this morning, but I would say only in passing that an examination of the decision below, I think, clearly reveals that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was quite mindful of its obligations under Erie to decide this case under Florida law and that the Court’s decision is well supported by authorities, including Florida case law and I might add they cited a decision of the Florida Supreme Court in support of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.966" offset="7256607">Petitioner referred to four cases in his oral argument which he alleges the Court of Appeals disregarded or overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.508" offset="7290776">I might say only in commenting upon that that only one of these cases was even cited by the petitioners to the Court of Appeals, three of them have been referred to in their brief to this Court, but were not even included in their brief to the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.433" offset="8274442">The basic rule turning to the federal law, governing the obligation of federal courts to decide question of state law in actions based upon diversity jurisdiction was of course set forth by this Court in the Meredith case, which is generally regarded as a landmark decision, covering the obligation of federal courts to decide questions of state law in diversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.199" offset="8373499">This Court said and I will quote briefly, “It has from the first been deemed to be the duty of the federal courts, if their jurisdiction is properly invoked, to decide questions of state law whenever necessary to the rendition of judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.565" offset="8442984">This Court then went on to say that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a failure to decide such questions of state law, and again I quote, “Merely because the answers to the questions of state law are difficult or have not yet been given by the highest court of the State would thwart the purposes of the jurisdictional act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.526" offset="8538802">Now, the principles that have been set forth by Meredith have been reaffirmed by this Court on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.751" offset="8563775">In Propper against Clark, this Court indicated that to allow the difficulty of an issue of a state law to deter a federal court from deciding the issue of state law in a diversity case would be and again I quote “to enervate diversity jurisdiction”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.439" offset="8638485">Again in McNeese against the Board of Education, this Court noted that in a diversity of citizenship case and I quote “we hold that difficulties and perplexities of state law are no reason for referral of the problem to the state court.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.753" offset="10711771">If I might just continue my answer to Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe that one of the real problems in any kind of abstention including certification is the delay and the extra burdens, the added expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.435" offset="10770495">Now certification may lessen those burdens, but it certainly doesn’t eliminate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.158" offset="10793378">It’s been reported that certification to the State of Florida increases the length of a case maybe by at least a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.864" offset="10824202">It in affect produces two full dress appeals where one had taken place before and I might say that this particular case is really a inappropriate case to permit this kind of certification since the delay involved here is even more pronounced because of the fact that the petitioners here did not even request certification.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.900" offset="11076336">However, he added at the end that perhaps certification should have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.472" offset="11094622">Ceasing upon that, the petitioners then made a motion for rehearing and I think it is interesting to note that even in their petition for rehearing, they did not come out in a forth right way and say, this case should be certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.621" offset="11155226">They asked for a rehearing en banc on the merits in effect, asking the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit again to decide the case on the merits and then in the final paragraph of the 12-page petition for rehearing, in effect what they said is, that if you are not going to decide in our favor, then please send the case down to the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.267" offset="11261806">I might say perhaps in support of some of the points I said before that commentators have said in many instances and I refer to Professor Wright as an example of this, that certification and I quote is, “an undesirable innovation” if it will lead to an abrogation of the merit of doctrine and similar expressions are found in other commentaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.370" offset="11362220">The threshold question I would submit to this Court is whether this was basically a case for abstention of any kind and I think if you look at the nature of the case and the instances in which this court has granted abstention, I think it’s clear, it’s not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.018" offset="11424810">There is no constitutional question that can be avoided in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.755" offset="11855726">The main issue in this case is not even the propriety of the petitioners’ conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.491" offset="11878713">Even the petitioners have conceded here that the act that was committed that is trading with inside information has been subject to universal condemnation so that we are not even talking as we are in most abstention cases with whether certain conduct within a state is proper or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.803" offset="11967948">What we are talking about in this case is whether or not Lum’s should have a remedy to recover the profits which were made by these defendants as a result of their alleged trading with the use of confidential corporate information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.722" offset="12035657">We would submit only to the Court on this point that it cannot be seriously urged that it is the public policy of Florida that a person should be permitted to engage in trading with confidential corporate information in the stock of Florida Corporations and that the decision in this case will interfere with that public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.058" offset="12132937">Therefore, we would submit that this case does not present the classic conflicts or special circumstances which would have warranted abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.734" offset="12179644">I would say recognizing really that this is not a proper abstention case, the main thrust of the petitioners’ argument is that any case which involves an unsettled issue of law, of state law is a case which is a proper case for certification and they go even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.110" offset="12249234">They say if the court does not certify even if it was never even requested to do so that it has a committed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.906" offset="12284343">I think this Court has made it clear that, and if I may borrow a phrase from Mr. Justice Brennan, there is a very narrow corridor through which a federal court may escape from its obligation to decide state law questions when federal jurisdiction is properly invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.935" offset="12360516">We would respectfully submit that to accept the petitioners’ contention that where there is an unsettled issue of state law and I might say parenthetically in a majority of cases, it might be reasonably contended that the state law issue is not settled, that this would be to open the door wide and really to turn this narrow corridor which the Court has very carefully limited into what I think might be described as really a wide canyon and I think these are the clear implications of the petitioners’ argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.051" offset="12520908">There is no support that the petitioners can gain as I have indicated from either the Clay case or Dresner or Aldrich, since in those cases, you were dealing with classic abstention cases and in fact, Aldrich and Dresner were not even diversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.667" offset="12599380">In Clay, I think it’s also appropriate to note and I have referred to this, the remarks by Mr. Justice Douglas where he gave protest to the practice of making litigants travel a long and expensive road in order to obtain justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.136" offset="12653296">And I think in this case, I might add the case is already been pending three years, certification will now require the parties to perhaps spend another year on an appellate level by going down to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.761" offset="12711811">If certification is appropriate here, it may well be appropriate after trial, assuming that the plaintiff prevail on the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.794" offset="12763951">The proof in this case may be different than the allegations of the complaint and the issue may arise, have the plaintiffs’ prove the case under Florida law and again, the argument could be made that that is an issue that should be certified and the case may go on for many more years with the consequent burdens to the parties as a result of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.556" offset="13182955">I think this is a particularly inappropriate case I would submit to the Court to find that the court below erred in not certifying where the petition is never even requested certification before the adverse decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.063" offset="13241051">This Court has said I think time and time again that such a procedure is to be criticized and certainly should not be sanctioned where one goes into court, submits his rights to a court, gets an adverse decision and then wants to go to another court to litigate the same issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.714" offset="13303641">In the Hostetter case, in holding that it was not error in not abstaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.638" offset="13323285">This Court referred to the fact that neither party had requested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.281" offset="13337913">In the England case in somewhat different circumstances, this Court indicated that where a party like the petitioners freely litigates his claims in one court even though he may not be required to do so, he should not be allowed to ignore the adverse decision and then start all over to another court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.594" offset="13415131">That’s precisely what the petitioners are seeking to do here and as Mr. Justice Rehnquist aptly noted, we would not be here today seeking certification if the petitioners had prevailed in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.739" offset="13467690">This Court in England said that such a procedure, the kind that the petitioners are seeking to follow now would countenance and unnecessary increase in the length and cost of litigation and there are many other cases along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.732" offset="13519726">Those cases involving disqualification of a judge or court indicate that a litigant cannot experiment with the court to see what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.006" offset="13556820">So this is precisely what the petitioners have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.512" offset="13570821">They were quite willing to let the Court of Appeals decide the case, but then when it was decided against them, after they so to speak tested the water, found it not to their liking, then they urged that the Court should not have decided the case to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.114" offset="13641247">Mr. Hagan this morning, in his reply brief, I think made a remarkable statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.431" offset="13666429">In response to Mr. Rehnquist's question, he said that there was no occasion for certification until after the decision below since the Law of Florida was not debatable or uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.380" offset="13718256">I might say in passing if the law wasn’t uncertain then you wouldn’t even have a proper case for certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.177" offset="13745424">But the implication of what the petitioners are saying is, that you do not even determine whether certification is appropriate by considering the nature of the case or the issues before decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.359" offset="13798191">What you do is that, after the decision, you look at the decision and if you think that it is wrong, then you argue that certification should have taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.313" offset="13838002">I would suggest respectfully to the Court that this procedure has nothing to commend it and then certainly should not be sanctioned by this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.376" offset="13882201">One further point on the procedure, the petition has attempted in their reply brief to overcome the obvious inequity of the procedure they followed by making reference to the decision in the Kaiser case where after an adverse decision, the petitioner made a motion, asking the Court of Appeals to abstain pending a determination in a pending declaratory judgment action in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.748" offset="14003722">The Tenth Circuit denied that motion with Judge Brown who was sitting by designation from the Fifth Circuit dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.687" offset="14039458">The Kaiser case, however, this Court then of course went on to reverse and ordered abstention, the Kaiser case however, certainly is a different kind of case and doesn’t sanction the kind of procedure that the petitioners have followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.779" offset="14103824">Kaiser was a classic abstention case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.522" offset="14114795">You were dealing there with the law of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.402" offset="14126393">You are dealing there with the control of a vital natural resource, water within the State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.908" offset="14152411">Even the Attorney General of New Mexico had to come in and asked and the abstention take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.494" offset="14174772">Where you have this classic abstention case then the fact that the litigant did not ask for certification perhaps is not determinative because there you were dealing with great public stakes and if I will close just by referring with Judge Brown said in his dissent in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.044" offset="14260976">He said, if we were not dealing with serious matters of great public moment and importance to New Mexico, I would be quite willing to say to Kaiser that it must live with the consequences of a federal court diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.048" offset="14320953">And finally, he went on to say, similarly, the fact that the motion is now made after the adverse decision of this Court, while a powerful circumstance in many situations does not prevent the exercise of abstention now in view of this great public stakes and I would only urge this Court that here where we are not dealing with those great public stakes of considerations that are present in abstention that the failure to request certification before an adverse decision should either constitute a waiver or bar to argue that the court erred in not doing so or at the very least should represent in Judge Brown’s word a powerful circumstance in determining whether the Court of Appeals, assuming it had any discretion to certify, abused that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.664" offset="14527425">We submit that it did not and we respectfully urge that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.030" offset="14556891">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3637.560" offset="14627004">Mr. Justice Blackmun, I can’t say what they would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.690" offset="14639543">I would say what I think they should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.335" offset="14650096">I would think because this case does not involve those considerations which justify a federal court abstaining from deciding the question itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.431" offset="14690429">I would say it should not have certified in this case because in my judgment this Court has indicated that a federal court is under a duty which is placed upon it by Congress in the jurisdictional act to decide questions of state law except in those very narrow circumstances and I would respectfully submit that an examination of the nature of this case would reveal that those circumstances are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.027" offset="14800875">And therefore, I would believe that the Court of Appeals would come to that conclusion and I would assume Your Honor that since Judge Kaufman at least alluded to it that there was some discussion among the judges and this may well have been a consideration which influenced the court to decide the case as well as I have indicated the failure of the petitioners to request it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3724.668" offset="14975373">I think the fact that Judge Kaufman at least did mention it would suggest that the court did give consideration to it and decided on various grounds that it should decide the case and not certify.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3743.588" offset="15051128">Mr. Hagan, you have about five minutes left.</text>

            <label>Mr. James J. Hagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3748.884" offset="15072235">Your Honors, I believe that Mr. Ruby has overstated the position of the petitioners here and overstated the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.909" offset="15104418">We do not argue here for abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.634" offset="15115285">His entire argument in rebuttal and response is based on an abstention argument on the behalf of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.501" offset="15146736">Of course, this does not take away the right of any party that went to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.502" offset="15162723">The argument in favor of certification is that, it preserves that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.565" offset="15182994">That federal fact finding is available, federal rules of discovery are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.989" offset="15204728">The only issue that is certified is the issue of state law and it is found by the Federal Court in the same manner many other things are found in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.337" offset="15242136">In this case, the question of Florida law almost becomes in effect a fact to be found by utilizing the certification statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.766" offset="15279856">They argue merit and they are setting up a straw man here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.327" offset="15294067">We do not claim abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.038" offset="15300859">There is no need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.320" offset="15305979">That is in effect the beauty of the new certification statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.805" offset="15319980">These arguments that have plagued the courts and the commentators for 20 or 30 years, may in the future start to alleviate because abstention in this area may not be necessary anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.073" offset="15381002">Mr. Justice Marshall as well, pointed out that their basic position is that certification is not justified in any case because obviously, you always have delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.486" offset="15430740">The delay involved maybe several months, it maybe six months or more, but I would say that the answer to this delay argument which is always brought up by the party opposing either abstention or certification was well answered by this Court back in 1942 in Fieldcrest Dairies, where Mr. Justice Douglas said, considerations of delay inconvenience and cost to the parties which have been urged upon us, do not call for a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.205" offset="15549544">They were there granting abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.743" offset="15559680">What we are here concerned with the much larger issue as to the appropriate relationship between federal and state authorities, functioning as a harmonious whole and that issue is exactly before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.267" offset="15617776">The problems that have been raised by abstention over the years have now started to result in the statutory certification process and I submit that the Court should now encourage it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.539" offset="15662916">And finally, this point that who gets certification, whether you grant certification should almost be a form of gamesmanship as to who asks first or who does not ask for it is simply inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.659" offset="15715370">When we were before the Second Circuit, we were parties to a litigation where our view was that Florida law did not support the claim and the District Court had so found and respondents here were unable to cite a single Florida case supporting their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.728" offset="15779631">It was not our position before the Second Circuit that Florida law was so uncertain as to require certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.475" offset="15802619">It became that way when the majority here developed a doctrine it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.478" offset="15822681">Only then that the question of certification, come to the forefront.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.204" offset="15845564">Prior to that time, our position was not that the Law of Florida was unsettled or uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.872" offset="15872209">Now, with all of the problems Mr. Ruby points out about classical abstention, certainly the court that has had the most experience with certification in a federal context has not found it to be a burden and has found it in fact to be a great benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.656" offset="15939396">As recently as 1969, the Fifth Circuit in Martinez against Rodriguez said the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.477" offset="15966668">“We would be remiss if we did not once again, seize the opportunity to extol the virtues of the Florida certification procedure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.957" offset="16000627">For example, while this Court following the footsteps of the Stolrich (ph) below, might have reached the same conclusion as that of the Florida court with respect to the issue in this case, our decision would have had no assurance of predictable correctness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.370" offset="16058201">No matter how many federal judges, trial, appellate, three-judge panel, or the full panoply of the court en banc, any decision would have been an eerie guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.763" offset="16099788">Now, the guesswork has been eliminated and we are quickly presented with a definitive explication of Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.003" offset="16128731">That’s the view of the Fifth Circuit, not just these petitioners and we submit that this Court should reverse the decision below and direct the Second Circuit also to certify this question of Florida law to the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.127" offset="16189231">Thank you.</text>
