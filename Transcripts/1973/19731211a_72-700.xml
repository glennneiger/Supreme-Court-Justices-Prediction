            <text syncTime="45.183" offset="257463">The issue involved in this case is a jurisdictional one, namely, whether 38 U.S.C. Section 211 (a) bars judicial review of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress concerning veterans’ educational benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.305" offset="326008">In the companion case of Robison versus Johnson, the merits of the claim will be discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.480" offset="362684">The issue here is only whether 38 U.S.C. 211 (a) bars judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.288" offset="389851">During my 15 minutes, I will discuss the question of the proper statutory construction of 211 (a) and the due process limitations, which we feel are inherent in a contrary construction of 211 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="95.458" offset="458606">My colleague, Mr. Petranker will discuss the question of whether Congress has a power to sole limit judicial review and the question of the extent to which sovereign immunity is involved in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.197" offset="525584">The facts are simple and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.446" offset="546482">Petitioners here and our conscientious objectors who have performed two years of alternative services as required under Section 456 of 50 U.S.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.505" offset="606772">Thereafter, they applied for veterans’ educational benefits with the Veterans’ Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.174" offset="633417">Their claim for benefits was denied under the statute since they did not fall within the definition of those individuals who have served more than 180 days in active duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.060" offset="696947">Thereafter, petitioners filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in California challenging the constitutionality of the Veterans’ Readjustment Benefits Act on the grounds that it was in validation of the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.054" offset="1180944">The first issue that I’d like to address myself to is the proper statutory construction of 211 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="284.959" offset="1216575">We submit that under a proper interpretation of 211 (a), the more difficult constitutional questions involved in a contrary construction of 211 (a) need not be faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.360" offset="1274149">We submit under the plain meaning of the statute that this case should not be barred by 211 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="308.959" offset="1312601">The statute provides that the decisions of the Administrator, on any question of law or fact, under any law administered by the Veterans’ Administration, shall be final and the courts shall have no power to review any such decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.649" offset="1395357">By the terms of the language of that statute, this lawsuit is not barred for we are not seeking review of a decision of the Veterans’ Administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.726" offset="1603605">So we’re not seeking review on any question of law by the Veterans’ Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.461" offset="1630563">The statutory history of Section 211 (a) and particularly the 1970 Amendment support our conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.534" offset="1670896">The Government suggest that 211 (a), the 1970 Amendment of 211 (a) was meant to cut out judicial review even in this type of case where we’re challenging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.826" offset="1744039">It’s apparent from the legislative history that the purpose of the 1970 Amendment was merely to overrule certain decisions of the District -- the Circuit Court in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.129" offset="1817287">Concerning questions involving the termination of benefits, the DC Circuit had held that 211 (a) was not a bar to cases involving determination of benefits in contrast to those cases involving the application for benefits, and we submit that the 1970 Amendment was only meant to overrule this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.064" offset="1925016">There is nothing at all in the legislative history of the 1970 Amendment or the earlier enactments of the predecessors of 211 (a) that indicate that Congress wish to cutoff judicial review in this type of case, namely, where we’re seeking judicial review of the constitutionality of a statute, and --</text>

            <text syncTime="540.379" offset="2238276">Do you think this 211 would permit that sort of review or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="552.309" offset="2286028">Ours is a much narrower issue where there has been absolutely no review by any court or no decision by the Administrator at all on the questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.683" offset="2339527">Ours is a case in which the Administrator has refused to consider the constitutional challenges to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.049" offset="2376934">We’re not seeking review of a factual legal question which the Veterans’ Administration has already resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.217" offset="2425626">This construction of the statute would also be in line with this Court’s theory that judicial review of statutes should not be cutoff unless it’s within the plain meaning of the statute and the legislative history supports that interpretation, and we submit there isn’t such here.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.037" offset="2540878">Also, this interpretation of the statute would save this Court the necessity of facing the constitutional issues involved in the case which we submit are gray.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.149" offset="2669296">If 211 (a) were construed not to apply to case like this, we submit that petitioners’ due process rights have been violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.824" offset="5056052">Mr. Justice Stewart raised the question whether an individual could come into Court and claim a right to a hearing on his claim that he was entitled to benefits under the aid to dependent Children’s Act, even though he was not a mother and does not have dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.339" offset="5130136">I think the distinction between that case and this one is that there would be an independent basis there for denying jurisdiction and that is simply that his claim would be frivolous, whether or not it was brought in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.292" offset="5173917">I think that once the terms of the statute were taken into account and the purposes of the statute, that there simply would be no valid constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.201" offset="5213518">In this case, our position is that once the statute is properly considered in light of its purposes, there is a substantial constitutional claim that conscientious objectors who perform alternative service like persons who are in the Armed Forces are entitled to those benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.884" offset="6888281">But if that construction were possible, I think we would take the position that unless at the same time appeared that there was a definite right to go into state court, that the constitutional requirements of a hearing on the questions of constitutionality would not have been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.569" offset="6975007">There will also be an additional problem under Article III which we have addressed ourselves to in the briefs as to whether those questions could be entrusted completely to the state courts without the possibility of review in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.826" offset="7084095">Now, the Government has relied on two basic arguments for their view that the courts can indeed be deprived of jurisdiction to hear constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.791" offset="7135922">First, they point to the fact that Congress can, of course, control the jurisdiction of the federal courts, and I suppose, at least within limits the state courts as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.453" offset="7170612">But they failed the point to any case which is held that Congress can remove the jurisdiction of the courts to consider constitutional claims where the result would be that no court could consider a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.710" offset="7223589">And that’s what’s involved here and that is the rule that we believe the decisions of this Court and in fact the entire theory of this government requires that some court must be able to hear constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.142" offset="7277296">In addition, the Government relies on an application of the sovereign immunity doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.406" offset="7978423">I think the correct interpretation of that suggestion is that in a case where affirmative relief would cause a substantial interference with the function of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.273" offset="8293878">I have lost my voice to a cold over the weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.226" offset="8309656">And if I don’t come across loudly often times, let me know, I’ll try to speak out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.027" offset="8340898">There are two consolidated cases before the Court in Hernandez presenting the same issues on the merits and on jurisdiction as would be considered also in the Robison case next on the calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.791" offset="8411951">We don’t have an extensive factual record below because the case went off in a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.393" offset="8438282">And the allegations of the complaint do not provide substantial background about the plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.198" offset="8469525">We do know that they did, as alleged, serve two years of alternative service and were denied benefits when they applied to the VA for educational benefits provided by the 1966 Veterans Readjustments Benefits Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.622" offset="8571193">I think I will start by turning directly to the question of whether Section 211 applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.025" offset="8604839">By its terms it says that a decision of the Administrator of the VA under any of the laws administered by the VA with certain exceptions for contractual benefits, not involved here, shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any Court of the United States shall have jurisdiction or power to review such a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.992" offset="8716748">Now, we think this statute clearly covers this case by its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.484" offset="8738691">If plaintiffs are seeking here to review a decision of the Administrator namely that they are not entitled to benefits, their effort to get out of the terms of the statute really involves an assertion that there are reasons why he should -- the Administrator should have come to a contrary decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.997" offset="8820715">They say, he should have decided that they were entitled to benefits for reasons that he did not consider namely the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.443" offset="8854570">But you cannot avoid the fact that these cases seek to review a decision of the Administrator to the fact that they were not entitled the benefits, and therefore the cases are squarely within the terms of 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.592" offset="8911099">Now to appreciate the scope of preclusion of review that Congress intended, I think it is important to trace the background of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.162" offset="8957388">A forerunner of 211 was enacted in 1921 which provided that the Director of the Veterans’ Bureau, then administering the Veterans’ Benefits Laws, adopted after World War I, shall decide all questions arising under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.575" offset="9031053">Now in the Silver Shine case and a series of decisions in the 1920s, this Court decided that while any questions of fact were not subject to judicial review under that statute that a question of law, or the question whether the Administrator’s decision was arbitrary or whether there was any evidence whatever to support the decision might not be subject to the preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.438" offset="9142544">Then in 1933 Congress enacted the Economy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.235" offset="9161665">It’s part of the effort to reduce Government expenditures, and made various changes in the Veterans’ Benefits Program, and in that statute there was another preclusion provision which provided that all decisions of the Administrator under the provisions of law for non-contractual benefits shall be conclusive on all questions of law and fact and no official or Court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review those decisions by mandamus or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.832" offset="9292069">In Lynch against United States in the unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis, this Court observed that the 1933 provision was obviously intended by Congress to eliminate even the scope of review that the Court have previously said was available under the 1921 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.008" offset="9368764">And there was no intimation that any constitutional program was presented by that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.688" offset="9391543">Indeed, in Lynch, the Court discussed at some length the enormous power that Congress has to grant or withdraw benefits fortuitous or non-contractual benefits and the enormous power that Congress has to grant or withdraw a forum in which to press for relief under a statute granting such benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.238" offset="9489659">In 1957, the 1933 provision and a similar provision adopted in 1940 were combined into the immediate predecessor of 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.565" offset="9535007">At that statute, included the language to the effect that the Administrator’s decision on any question of law or fact concerning a claim for benefits under these non-contractual provision was conclusive and not subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.904" offset="9608359">A series of decisions in the District of Columbia Circuit construed 211 as not precluding review of a decision concerning termination or reduction of benefits distinguishing between claim and termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.219" offset="9669590">Now, this led Congress in 1970 to amend the statute retroactive to 1940 to make it perfectly clear that Congress intended that all decisions of the Administrator under the provisions of the statutes providing for non-contractual benefits were not subject to judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.972" offset="10504673">Mr. Norton, what if the petitioners here instead of having presented a claim to the Administrator, had simply gone into the District Court under 1331 and 1361 and challenged the constitutionality of the statute, could the Government have asserted the provision of 211 (a) as a defense to that action?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="2627.817" offset="10588056">Well, 211 (a) would not seem to apply on its face because it would not be -- if the Administrator have taken no action whatever on this issue, it would not seem that there would be a decision of the Administrator under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.123" offset="10657228">There would be other questions raised in such a suit as to whether it was premature, whether there have been exhaustion of administrative remedies, and of course sovereign immunity or another basis for jurisdiction would be additional issue that would have to be confronted. That of course is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.284" offset="10753881">The desire of Congress to preclude judicial review in this area seems amply justified by the potentially enormous burden that review of VA decisions would place on the Court it’s in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.368" offset="10814171">VA takes about 15 million adjudicative actions annually and the Board of Veterans Appeals alone disposes of some 30,000 cases, the vast majority of these involve claims under the various non-contractual benefit programs that are the subject of Section 211 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.633" offset="10899331">Now, the plaintiffs claim that if the suit is barred that they are denied their due process rights, but the critical provision of the Fifth Amendment that they never really face up to is that the Fifth Amendment protects against a denial of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.762" offset="10991804">And it’s this Court’s decision in the Roth case indicates every person who seeks some benefit or is disappointed by the action taken by Government concerning him does not have the basis for a claim under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.244" offset="11057737">There must be a property interest of some sort created either by statute, contract, practice, or common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.639" offset="11091278">The plaintiffs concede that under the statute on its face, they have no property interest in these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.466" offset="11118655">They try to construe or contend that the statute has to be read as unconstitutional if it does not extend benefits to them, and therefore, by combining the constitution and the statute, they have a property interest but the Court indicated in Roth that the Constitution does not create property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.574" offset="11207053">And that approach does not have any merit, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.411" offset="11226384">In addition, there is a problem that if the claim is made is that a statute unconstitutionally distinguishes between the groups by giving something to one and taking away or not giving to someone else, all the plaintiffs can really claim is that that distinction is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.245" offset="11305691">It doesn’t necessarily follow that they are entitled to get what someone else got.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.800" offset="11319902">It maybe that the answer is that the Court or the benefit should not have been extended to either group either it was to everyone or to none, so that the Constitution itself, even in conjunction for the statute does not give them a right to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.004" offset="11412793">The plaintiffs have contended that they have a right to a court hearing because of Article III of the Constitution, which they say, basically requires that a federal court be available to hear any and all constitutional questions that may be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.860" offset="11488235">Now, just in last term in the Palmore case, this Court rejected the proposition that Congress was obliged under Article III to vest in the federal courts all of the judicial power authorized by Article III, and it is still the law and has been throughout our history that to have jurisdiction in a Court, there has to be a statute extending that jurisdiction, and Congress has the power to grant jurisdiction and has power to limit jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.786" offset="11631909">And as the Court said in Lynch, the power knows virtually no limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.966" offset="11664614">We would -- on the question whether 211 applies to state court proceeding if that has not previously been raised in this case as this case arose in a federal court, the question of state court jurisdiction over a case like this is one that, I think, would require additional consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.358" offset="11766178">It is certainly not the position of the Veterans’ Administration that all these cases should be litigated in the state courts and if a case were filed in the state court, there would be a question of sovereign immunity just as there is a question of sovereign immunity in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.579" offset="11847053">To determine whether there would be state court jurisdiction you would have to know the nature of the proceeding, the nature of the state law, and the relief sought and other matters that I do not think can be decided in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.085" offset="11905045">But on the question of sovereign immunity, this is a suit against the Veterans’ Administration by name, its administrator and the regional administrator concerning the actions of these officials in the course of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.491" offset="11970664">The relief sought would require the affirmative action of these officials in turning over to the plaintiffs’ funds, property, money that is unquestionably belonging to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.484" offset="12022700">Now we feel that this brings -- it makes the case squarely one against the United States in substance even if in form against its officials and under the --</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.907" offset="13132382">Now, if that was a correct determination then the Court can affirm the action of the District Court on the jurisdictional rule and because it was properly made by a single judge as we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.652" offset="13187344">Now the District Court’s determination that there was no substantial question, constitutional question was made in view of what the Court thought of the manifest differences between alternative service and military service and the reasonableness of providing this fringe benefit to veterans of military service in the absence of any cognizable burden on the free exercise of religion and also the lack of any establishment or religion in the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.269" offset="13317851">The substance of that ruling really requires a consideration of the merits which is presented in the Robison case and has not been touched on in the arguments here, so that I think it would be appropriate for me to defer that for further discussion until that case, and if I were to begin it here, I would be unfair to the other side, although I would not want to give up my time here and not be able to continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.893" offset="14224300">Justice Marshall put a question to you or perhaps to one of your friends awhile ago, saying that if the Veterans’ Administration can find educational benefits to those veterans who had served overseas that that might conceivably raise a constitutional question and the three-judge court or a single district judge might conceivably, I take it, decided to call or convene a three-judge court for that purpose, you would not agree with it perhaps?</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.315" offset="14386051">But I am trying to distinguish that kind of the case, raising what would appear to be a significant constitutional question from the one which you considered insubstantial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.023" offset="14436833">In short, you wouldn’t say it was an insubstantial claim if the Veterans’ Administration was denying benefits to all veterans except those who went overseas when the statute obviously gives no such authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.284" offset="14505900">Well, we say that 211 bars any review of a decision of the Administrator and on 211 alone, the District Court properly dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.939" offset="14556473">We don’t think it was necessary for him to address the three-judge court question, a motion was before him, he may have felt an appropriate thing to do to not to leave it unresolved in order to make it clear that his action on the motion to dismiss was properly taken as a single judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.241" offset="14645708">Let’s take an extreme case then, that the Veterans’ Administration Administrator decides that because of the shortage of funds, rate inflation, and a lot of factors, he is not going to pay any education benefits to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.796" offset="14723971">He is just going to nullify that section of the Act of Congress, would say that that would not be open to mandamus under 211?</text>
