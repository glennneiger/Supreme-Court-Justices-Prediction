            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">In Codispoti against Pennsylvania, we are also dealing with a judgment for criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.095" offset="117133">The case is here on writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.327" offset="138031">Here the contemnors were two defendants at the criminal trial who were acting as their own attorney and who were found guilty of criminal contempt after trial for several acts that occurred during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.058" offset="208980">We hold that in the case of post-verdict adjudications of various acts of contempt, committed during trial, the Sixth Amendment requires a jury trial, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments require a jury trial, if the sentences imposed aggregate more than six months, even though no sentence for more than six months is imposed for any one act of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.172" offset="305424">We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which had held that the jury trial was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.881" offset="344294">I have filed an opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Powell joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.377" offset="374282">Mr. Justice Marshall joins in parts one and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.898" offset="400300">He has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.269" offset="409809">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.342" offset="438126">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice has joined.</text>
