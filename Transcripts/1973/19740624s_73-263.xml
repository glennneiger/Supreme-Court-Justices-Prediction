            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="11.833" offset="124029">This is a Federal income tax case coming to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.986" offset="152660">Idaho Power Company is a corporation tax payer.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.430" offset="170423">It is a public utility engaged in the production and transmission and distribution and sale of electric energy in the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.479" offset="206681">In addition to all of this, the company for many years itself has engaged in construction of capital facilities, mainly transmission and distribution lines and connections between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.354" offset="258194">It has not done all of its work of this kind and but it has done a major portion of it and it, thus, had scores of employees so engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.423" offset="294452">The case centers on tension or strain between two provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.623" offset="323291">Section 167 allows a depreciation deduction from gross income with respect to property used in the taxpayer’s trader business or held for the production of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.626" offset="375223">On the other hand, Section 263 disallows a deduction for any amount payed out for new buildings or for permanent improvements and there is still another section, 161, which makes the deduction provisions subject to certain exceptions including Section 263.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.614" offset="455158">The issue here is whether the tax payer may assert depreciation on its transportation equipment such as cars and trucks, to the extent that, that depreciation relates to the construction of capital facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.429" offset="514508">The depreciation on the taxpayer’s books was allocated to capital rather than income, but this was required as a matter of accounting by the Federal Power Commission and the Idaho Public Utilities Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.539" offset="566857">Other cost of construction, such as wages, were similarly charge to capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.882" offset="592248">In its income tax returns for 1962 and 63, Idaho Power claimed there is a deduction, the construction related depreciation on its automotive equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.151" offset="645329">It did not claim as deductions other construction related costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.973" offset="664660">The Commissioner disallowed the deduction on a petition for redetermination to file with the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.832" offset="688065">That court upheld the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.707" offset="699559">The Ninth Circuit, however, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.334" offset="710113">We granted certiorari because the Ninth circuit declined to follow a Court of Claims decision on the issue that appear to go the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.885" offset="744281">We reversed the Court of Appeals and hold that the equipment depreciation allocable to the taxpayer’s construction of capital facilities must be capitalized under Section 263 and is not allowable as a deduction under Section 167.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.461" offset="814602">Our reasons for this conclusion are set forth in some detail in the opinion filed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.923" offset="836441">I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
