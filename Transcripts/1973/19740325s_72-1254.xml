            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="17.047" offset="144927">This case is here on appeal from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.154" offset="165407">Appellee wore a smaller representation of the United Statesâ€™ Flag on the seat of his trousers.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.849" offset="196127">He was prosecuted under Massachusetts Statute that subjects to criminal liability anyone who publicly treats contemptuously the Flag of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.024" offset="248895">Although other portions of the statute deal broadly with misuse and mutilation of the Flag, appellee was charged only with treating it contemptuously.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.927" offset="300408">He was convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.284" offset="317858">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.803" offset="340010">Thereafter a Federal District Court found the statute unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and granted a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.780" offset="383896">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.147" offset="397375">We agree with both the District Court and the Court of Appeals that the contempt portion of the statute is void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.183" offset="453486">The statute, whose sweeping language has never been narrowed by the State Courts, affords inadequate warning of the forbidden conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.473" offset="498625">Moreover it leaves the police, the courts and juries free to prosecute and impose criminal liabilities on little more than their own preferences for treatment of the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.610" offset="555154">Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.828" offset="568111">Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.040" offset="584934">Justice Blackmun and Rehnquist have filed dissenting opinions in which the Chief Justice had joined.</text>
