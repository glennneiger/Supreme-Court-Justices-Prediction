            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Cheavens</label>
            <text syncTime="35.981" offset="220682">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.639" offset="239282">This case is an admiralty case brought before the Court on grant of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.143" offset="281287">The broad issue posed by the case concerns the right of contribution in admiralty between joint tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.799" offset="319948">Before we reach and discuss that broad issue, I think it behooves us first to examine in some detail, the particular factual and procedural context in which this case is presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.561" offset="394971">The story of the case is where it begins in Mobile, Alabama, where my client, Cooper Stevedoring Company loaded a cargo of palletized crated fire brick aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.646" offset="463308">The evidence shows that, that loading was done under the supervision of the Chief Officer of the vessel and the supercargo, an employee of the time charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.231" offset="501656">Upon completion of the discharge, the stowage performed by my client was inspected and approved by the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.923" offset="544392">The cargo, the evidence showed was not secured at Mobile in any way to prevent it from shifting at sea nor was it covered with dunnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.808" offset="587964">The ship sailed and went to Houston, there the plaintiff, Mr. Troy Sessions, who was one of the first longshoremen to work on top of the Mobile stowed cargo, he was carrying a sack of cargo and he stepped on a piece of paper, which obscured a crack between the crates, which had been loaded in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.314" offset="669989">His foot went into the crack and he sustained a back injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.001" offset="688797">As a result, he first of course drew a compensation benefits, under the United States Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.652" offset="727353">In connection therewith, he also brought an action against the vessel owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.502" offset="750759">The Vessel then filed a rather standard Ryan indemnity action against both Mr. Sessions’ employer, Mid-Gulf Stevedores in Houston and against my client, Cooper Stevedore in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.421" offset="806452">It’s important to notice two things at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.719" offset="819618">First, that Mr. Sessions did not sue my client, Cooper, directly, although there was no statutory bar to his having done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.998" offset="860787">Secondly, the indemnity action asserted by the ship against both Mid-Gulf and Cooper was an action purely for breach of warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.352" offset="898194">It was not an action seeking contribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.952" offset="1284598">Shortly, before the trial of the case, Mid-Gulf, the Houston Stevedores, took over the defense of the vessel and in so doing, he agreed to indemnify the vessel fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.472" offset="1334648">Now, at this point he’s been challenged in respondent’s brief, they have asserted that no place does this appear of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.833" offset="1364114">I would cite the Court to page 118 of the appendix, where Mr. Smith testified concerning this.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.181" offset="1389505">The District Court made a specific fact-finding on page 164, if there’s any question about it, on the final page of the brief, filed in the Fifth Circuit, on behalf of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.959" offset="1448542">If this Circuit has a Local Rule of 13 (a) which requires a Recusal statement, in order for the Court to evaluate possible disqualification of the Circuit requires each counsel to state who the real party in interest in the case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.331" offset="1510087">That Recusal statement says, Texas Employers Insurance Association, which the record shows is Mid-Gulf, insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.114" offset="1541224">Texas Employers Insurance Association is obligated by a contract of indemnity to pay any final judgment, which may be rendered against the appellees and cross-appellants in this case, the appellees and cross-appellants in the Fifth Circuit, of course there being the Vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.214" offset="1613636">Upon conclusion of the trial of the case, the District Court made these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.324" offset="1638087">The Vessel was found unseaworthy and the vessel owner negligent in three respects, first in the failure to secure the crates in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.362" offset="1678211">Secondly, in failure to dunnage off the cargo, and thirdly, because of the presence of this piece of paper, which obscured the dangerous condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.444" offset="1722514">The District Court also found that Cooper was negligent with respect to the failure to dunnage off and the failure to secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.901" offset="1764310">Now, I think it’s important at this point to carefully examine the precise legal significance of those findings.</text>
