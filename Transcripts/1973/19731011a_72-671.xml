            <label>Mr. Kenneth R. Carr</label>
            <text syncTime="16.439" offset="169148">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.886" offset="182941">Yesterday at recess, we were examining some of the factors that the Congress had before at the time it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.109" offset="215855">We’d looked at the fact that the Federal Government operating under the same prohibitory languages as is contained in Title VII of Civil Rights Act, so no inconsistency for 21 years in applying the same policy that Farah applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.855" offset="278758">Then we were in process of looking at the fact that some 19 State Fair Employment Practice Commissions as of 1964 had addressed themselves to the question of whether they under their own FEP legislation barring discrimination on the basis of national origin or national ancestry, an employer could nevertheless require that his employees be citizens and of those 19 states, 18 had found no inconsistency in the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.764" offset="398399">Then we turn if we may to the debate surrounding the 1964 Act itself, and of course, the very first thing we’re faced with is the remark of Congressman Roosevelt who is Chairman of the House Subcommittee which reported out what became the Civil Rights Act and in the course of being questioned on the floor of the House with regard to what national origin meant, he said, “I just made very clear that national origin means national.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.945" offset="503202">It means the country from you and your fore bearers came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.670" offset="518040">You may come from Poland, Czechoslovakia, England, France or any other country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="109.884" offset="542908">And with that, the subject was dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.332" offset="548655">Now, in his brief, Mr. Cooper points out that this is isolated, that there’s only one such illustration in the debate and I might suggest there that the reason is because the reason was so obvious that once answered in the normal understanding of the word, there was no further necessity for expanding them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="130.173" stopTime="140.847">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="130.173" offset="624097">Well how does that affect -- how did Congressman Roosevelt’s words bear on this issue or help your case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_r_carr" startTime="140.847" stopTime="319.525">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth R. Carr</label>
            <text syncTime="140.847" offset="666728">Because Your Honor, they hold that the national origin prohibition in the Act means that it’s unlawful for Farah in the facts of this case to discriminate against people on the basis of the fact that they or their ancestors came from Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.136" offset="727960">The facts in this case clearly show that there has been no such discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.176" offset="744051">Rather the discrimination, and it exists, there is discrimination, no question, is based on the fact that the person was not a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.116" offset="779786">Now, under Congressman Roosevelt’s language, if Farah had a policy of hiring nationals from Poland, from Czechoslovakia, from England and France, but not nationals of Mexico, then there would be discrimination on the national origin of the individual and it would clearly be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.653" offset="857945">But everybody acknowledges and all the facts stand clear that that’s not Farah’s policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.791" offset="890546">The only other reference to somewhere to this that we were able to find was in the debates or the hearings before Congressman Roosevelt’s committee where then Secretary of Labor, Willard Wirtz was described in the Federal Policy of complaint processing on the grounds of employment discrimination within the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.343" offset="976750">And Secretary Wirtz’s attention obviously was primarily with regard to racial discrimination, but then he turned to national origin and religious discrimination and he said, “For example, if a person feels that he’s been disadvantaged because he is of Mexican, Italian or Polish origin, then he files a complaint with the commission and proceeds.”</text>
            <text syncTime="239.114" offset="1059819">Now, obviously, it was implicit in what Secretary Wirtz was saying that every single one of those people were United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.569" offset="1085628">They wouldn’t even been employees of the Federal Government if they weren’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.822" offset="1106631">Section 701 (b), which has now been -- of Title VII which is now recodified into 5 U.S.C. 7151, declares that it is the policy of the Federal Government not to discriminate on the grounds of national origin and yet, no one understood that this was changing the federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.941" offset="1183117">It was only making statutory what’s theretofore been the rule by Executive Order and everyone understood that the Federal Government was still going to limit its employment practices -- employment hiring to United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.063" offset="1243617">And indeed, I’ll direct your attention if I might, to the brief filed herein on the motion for a certiorari filed by the Solicitor General where he says that the US agrees with the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation that Congress construed the phrase to mean ancestry rather than citizenship, and then he makes the obvious point in a footnote that surely Congress intended that the same meaning be applied to Section 701 (b) of Title VII as it applied in Section 703 (a).</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth R. Carr</label>
            <text syncTime="600.176" offset="2504077">Your Honor, there is in the record, the recognition that one time, Farah deviated from that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.480" offset="2541275">Now, it’s not in the record and I apologize both to counsel and the Court, I represented the facts in my brief and they are correct, but they’re not contained in the record now.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.775" offset="2582444">That’s because we weren’t asked on an interrogatory, it would’ve come out, but there’s been one single exception in the history of the company, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.382" offset="2640854">While Mr. Chief Justice Burger in Griggs pointed out that EEOC guidelines are entitled to great difference and we don’t quarrel for that -- with that for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.907" offset="2678993">He then said that the reason they do is that since the Act in its legislative history support the commission’s conclusion, this affords good reason to treat the guidelines as expressed in the Will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.849" offset="2722774">And it seems to me that this is analogous to a fair labor standards Act situation where this Court in Skidmore versus Swift and consistently since has said that interpretative bulletins of the Secretary of Labor and wage hour cases are entitled to great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.163" offset="2792051">But in Skidmore versus Swift itself, the Court held that the reason they are is because of the weight of such judgment, in a particular case, it said will depend on the thoroughness evident in its consideration upon the validity of its reasoning and all those other factors which give these interpretative bulletins the power to persuade, if not the power to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.117" offset="2891839">And the Courts while giving tremendous deference and have [Laughter Attempt] been on the losing side of one or two to interpretative bulletins of the Secretary of Labor, they don’t hesitate to overrule them where they’re wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.770" offset="2950457">Now, we think that that’s precisely what the Court should do in Griggs, I’m sorry in Farah.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.447" offset="2989119">In support of that, we’d show you what we regard as the fatal flaw in the EEOC’s reasoning and again, direct you attention to the memorandum on the question of whether certiorari should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.951" offset="3043140">The Solicitor General pointed to the record of Farah in employing people of Mexican origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.077" offset="3079711">And the fact that over 90% of our employees have such origin and the he referred this to the atypical factual situation presented here which makes this a poor case to determine the validity of the EEOC guideline and the interpretation of the Act it embodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.636" offset="3145958">And in the footnote in the same brief, speaking I’m certain for the EEOC, the Solicitor said that in light of these same factors, the EEOC agrees that this is not an appropriate case in which to test the validity of its guidelines, and therefore, asked the Court not to grant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.941" offset="3219101">It seems to me that this just proves the invalidity of the EEOC's reasoning because the guideline as set out says that it doesn’t matter what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.065" offset="3259643">If you have the employee citizenship criterion for employment, then you got a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.117" offset="3283884">But we don’t want you to look [Laughter Attempt] at the facts here because they’re not good for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.055" offset="3299558">And if that’s the case, this would be the perfect case to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.569" offset="3317635">And we suggest that the reason they didn’t want the Court to grant cert was because they knew that the Court would overrule -- or would affirm the Fifth Circuit decision and throw out their guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.204" offset="3364237">Counsel did raise yesterday and in this brief one case which appears to have some similarity between our case, and that’s the Phillips versus Martin Marietta.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.953" offset="3419199">Superficially, the argument is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.236" offset="3428289">In Phillips versus Martin Marietta, Martin Marietta was charged with sex discrimination against women and they defended on the grounds, “We couldn’t be possibly discriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.714" offset="3470190">75% of our employees are women.”</text>
            <text syncTime="845.035" offset="3483564">But the deference was that as to all potential male applicants, Martin Marietta said, “You’re welcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.399" offset="3517001">We’re going to look at you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="855.144" offset="3523897">As to women applicants, they said, “You’re welcome unless you have a child under six.”</text>
            <text syncTime="862.064" offset="3551587">Now, to analogize Martin Marietta to Farah would be the same distinction I drew earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.287" offset="3580531">If we had Polish aliens, and English aliens, and French aliens but not Mexican aliens, then we’d be treating the person differently, but we’re not and therefore Martin Marietta also has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.656" offset="3685961">Mr. Justice Stewart, I believe yesterday asked Mr. Cooper whether there was any evidence in the record with regard to who was hired in the petitioner’s place and Mr. Cooper said that there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.640" offset="3745938">Now, in the appendix at page 89, the deposition of the petitioner is reprinted.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.863" offset="3786794">She was asked there, “Do you know who was hired for the job for which you were applying?”</text>
            <text syncTime="924.949" offset="3803199">And she said, “No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="926.064" offset="3807587">But the next question was, “Do you understand that those persons were Mexican-Americans with Mexican ancestry, but who are United States citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="933.964" offset="3839248">She answered, “Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="936.165" offset="3848025">Now, in Green versus McDonald Douglas, this Court said that one of the factors that needed to prove up a prima facie case of racial discrimination was for the petitioner to show or the plaintiff to show that a person of a different race had been hired in his stead.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.157" offset="3923989">And here, it’s clear from the plaintiff’s deposition that the person hired in her stead was of the same national origin as she.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.457" offset="3997236">Your Honor, if there are no further questions, we'd then just urge that the Court to affirm the decision below as immanently correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.193" offset="4024195">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
