            <text syncTime="183.931" offset="812513">Yet the defendants in their own survey conducted in November of 1967, seven months before the new immigration laws even went into effect, admitted that they were close to 2,000 non-English speaking Chinese students who as the petitioners are before you effectively excluded from education.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.714" offset="1403611">It’s quite insular and when the students who are born in this country, come to the schools, they do not have the facilities in English and unfortunately the actions of the school system perpetuate that inability to speak English.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.286" offset="4121913">Well, I hope I could address the question as Mr. Will Pottinger address himself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.361" offset="4138214">I think that the language is precise in the sense that Congress is concerned that programs receiving federal funds, there would be no basis, there’ll be no discrimination on the basis of national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.631" offset="4183249">One of the inherent components of national origin would be language discrimination and the regulations which came down even before this lawsuit was brought were issued pursuant to that mandate and the guidelines which came down the day before the lower court order was issued extend further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.392" offset="4254302">I would hope that Mr. Pottinger would answer more fully questions in his address later, unless Your Honors wish to pursue it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.929" offset="4292441">As we have indicated, the overall result in this case is in effective exclusion of petitioners from educational benefits, opportunity to receive educational benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.640" offset="4331311">Contrast this with the situation confronting this Court in Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.959" offset="4344581">In Rodriguez this Court said, this is at 93 Supreme Court pages 1291, 1299, “Texas' financing system provides at least an adequate program of education for every child in every school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.308" offset="4397976">No charge fairly could be made that the financing system failed to provide each child with an opportunity to acquire basic minimal skills.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.206" offset="4429531">That is the very charge that we are making here and as the record shows, the respondents have admitted this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.978" offset="4456699">This Court has always been concerned with looking beyond, if you will, “surface equality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.587" offset="4483135">The Ninth Circuit was satisfied as was the lower court that “surface equality” satisfied the Equal Protection Clause giving everybody the same thing even though some cannot benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.839" offset="4520124">This Court has always shown, cases even decided before Brown versus Board of Education and the education, in Sweatt versus Painter, McLaurin versus Oklahoma Board of Regents, that there is something to education that education is the essence, if you will, is communication, the interplay of ideas and ability to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.843" offset="4588147">Mr. Justice Frankfurter 20 years ago, made I feel a very cute observation in the Dennis versus United States in the dissenting opinion, when he said “there is no greater inequality than the equal treatment of unequals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.765" offset="4643840">And I think the Ninth Circuit is ignoring the truth of this observation by failing to recognize that education is not solely a matter of physical presence in a classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.501" offset="4682710">That although the 1,800 petitioners and all other students in San Francisco do receive the same materials, the pages are blank for these petitioners, the print conveys nothing, and I think this is what the Court was contrasted if you will in Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.365" offset="4742165">When at least in Rodriguez the students were provided a minimum amount of education that every student was given -- acquired, an opportunity to acquire basic minimal skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.743" offset="4787722">Once we have this discrimination, the next question I believe this Court must face is how to evaluate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.316" offset="4809979">And since 1886, when the Supreme Court decided the case of Yick Wo versus Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.689" offset="4835474">This Court has historically given close scrutiny and special protection to Chinese individuals like petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.801" offset="4871941">In fact, last term in Rodriguez this Court, through Mr. Justice Powell's decision, stated the three indicia of what constitutes a suspect class, it is at 93 Supreme Court page 1294.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.575" offset="4927007">Now I would like to just repeat them to show you how clearly the petitioners in this case fall within those indicia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.552" offset="4946965">“Saddled with historical disabilities, relegated to a position of political powerlessness, subjected to a history of purpose on equal treatment, this Court has always recognized this concerning Chinese individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.147" offset="4993358">In fact in a case 40 years after, Yick Wo, Yu Cung Eng versus Trinidad in 1926 Supreme Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.337" offset="5022093">The Supreme Court in that case recognized discrimination to Chinese-speaking individuals, not just Chinese people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.624" offset="5051246">Moreover, Your Honor even if this Court could use the more differential rational relationship test, the respondents have offered no reasons to even satisfy that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.657" offset="5095340">Unfortunately, they have offered no reasons to satisfy any test and we submit that the discrimination and the absence of any type of justification for it must leave this Court define for the petitioners and order the respondents to develop plans within their own expertise which would overcome the deprivations this petitioners suffer and provide them opportunities to learn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.729" offset="5199621">My 20 minutes are up Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.545" offset="5206936">Mr. Pottinger will now speak.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.780" offset="5243820">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.377" offset="5258240">The State of California like most states of the union has sought -- has seen fit to compel its students to attend school to set as one of the educational goals, the mastery of the English language indeed to require a demonstration in this language as a condition for graduation from high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.238" offset="5333682">Ascribing this critical role to the English language has not, however, in our opinion, the issue in contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.407" offset="5362416">The issue is whether in so doing the state in this case, the San Francisco School Board assumes a correlative obligation to insure that national origin minority children are not effectively excluded from participation in the educational process by virtue of that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.638" offset="5431275">We believe that such an obligation does exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.105" offset="5449143">Now, as mentioned to you, there are two areas of the law under which this obligation maybe shown to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.558" offset="5474952">The Equal Protection Clause to which Mr. Steinman has addressed himself, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to which we wish, the United States wishes to address itself at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.605" offset="5535138">It can be shown in this case that the conditions for application of Title VI exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.770" offset="5567843">The language itself of Title Vi, the three basic protections of Title VI go beyond the Fourteenth Amendment in a coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.659" offset="5607340">That Title provides that no person shall on grounds of color, race or national origin first to be excluded from participation in a program, second be denied the benefits of a program, or third in more equal protection type language be subjected to discrimination under a program or any activity receiving federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.841" offset="5700127">In other words, Title VI is not coterminous with Fourteenth Amendment because it was enacted not only pursuant to that amendment, but pursuant to the welfare clause and hence as it is by the necessary in proper clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.714" offset="5751641">And thereby finding that the power of federal government is the basis for this enactment to condition the expenditure of its funds upon reasonable restrictions related to the purpose or purposes for which those grants were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.842" offset="5808065">This is clear in the legislative history to the act --</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.976" offset="5916630">The legislative history to Title VI makes clear that even the opponents of the Act conceded, indeed discussed in some colloquy the broader basis for the Act, that is broader than the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.217" offset="5969607">Now San Francisco in this particular case has bound itself to compliance with Title Vi and its regulations and all requirements of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare imposed pursuant to those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.040" offset="6020911">Specifically, it has said in a so-called 441 assurance of compliance that it hereby agrees that it will comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and all requirements imposed by or pursuant to the regulation of the Department of HEW to the end that no person shall be denied the benefits of that Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.667" offset="6139402">In this particular case it was not invoked because in fact this case is in Court and HEW under its own regulations has the administrative discretion to allow the case to go forward toward enforcement through the federal courts rather than by a duplicate of administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.323" offset="6206067">Nevertheless, the provisions of Title VI under the regulations would apply equally whether the form is the federal District Court or HEW.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1540.460" offset="6238563">Didn’t this Court suggest that that was the remedy I think in Rosado against Wyman or one of the New York cases that when states are not complying with conditions of grants that the remedy was to cut off the grant and that the District Court had an alternative remedy or duty indeed to stop the expenditure of federal money?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger</label>
            <text syncTime="1565.254" offset="6337724">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.448" offset="6346501">That could have been done in this case, had the District Court so found its duty to be such under Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.146" offset="6373355">Of course it did not do so, because it did not in fact we believe to give reasonable consideration to Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.405" offset="6410344">The regulations of Title VI make even more specific, the obligation of school boards not to provide any service or other benefit in such a way that is different from that provided to other groups of children to restrict an individual in a way that would restrict his enjoinment of an advantage or privilege or to deny an individual an opportunity to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.214" offset="6509610">And of course as this Court has recognized in such cases as the Public Utilities Commission of California against the United States, regulations so are issued have the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.937" offset="6552451">Now in addition to that, however, in interpreting both the basic protections of Title VI and the regulations, HEW has indeed gone further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.516" offset="6590798">It has construed the meaning of Title VI in a national origin discrimination memorandum relevant to this case by stating that where inability to speak and understand the English language excludes national origin minority group children from the effective participation in the educational program offered by the school district, the school district must take affirmative steps to rectify the language deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.215" offset="6697587">Again, as this Court has held in such cases as Trafficante against Metropolitan Life Insurance or Griggs against Duke Power or Udall against Tallman where a consistent administrative construction of the Act by HEW like the former regulations of the Act are shown that consistent construction is entitled to great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.898" offset="6784313">In fact, HEW for a number of years now has sought to implement Title VI by this consistent known official policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.246" offset="6817750">In 71 school districts which have been notified of violations of Title VI or reviewed for violations, 34 of which have been notified of non-compliance, 80 of which had been reviewed pursuant to another statute which refers to the National Origin Minority Memorandum and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.191" offset="6897476">There is in other words consistent practice and known contours of what this policy and practice would lead to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.353" offset="6926211">And may I say at this moment that we in the United States also appreciate the specter of a chaotic policy that might flow from a ruling which would require a massive effort on behalf of virtually every child who could show in any sense an ethnic heritage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.288" offset="7005936">We are not contending as Mr. Steinman has pointed out, (a) that the law would require such chaos or (b) that in this particular case, it would be necessary to go beyond the class of students who are effectively excluded.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1747.437" stopTime="1759.771">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1747.437" offset="7066540">Well, would you relate that concretely for me to the colloquy we had with your associate on Russians, Portuguese, Danes, Israelis etcetera?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="1759.771" stopTime="1875.819">
            <label>Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger</label>
            <text syncTime="1759.771" offset="7115860">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice Burger I would be pleased to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.649" offset="7123383">I think that there are three points that are crucial to understanding that specter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.020" offset="7148878">The first is that any child on account of national origin who may suffer discrimination is indeed protected under Title VI as well we believe as under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.347" offset="7198093">The actual remedy of course would be something that would determine whether a specter truly exists or not or whether chaos would exist but the right is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.250" offset="7237799">Second, we believe, it’s clear from longstanding administrative practice at the Department of Health Education and Welfare that effective implementation of Title VI in this area does not lead to a difficult or burdensome effort on the part of school districts to meet specific needs of virtually every ethnic minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.966" offset="7328601">And the reasons for that are simple, we believe, historically the 19th Century system of assimilation of ethnic minorities, particularly Caucasian minorities in this country has been one of a melting pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.591" offset="7383144">But historically as this Honorable Court knows, non-Caucasian minorities in this country have not been able to assimilate in quite the same fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.719" offset="7423582">There has been insularity historically in this country and in this particular case that insularity is even greater where the language difficulties or incompatibilities exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.164" offset="7473424">Indeed, this case does go beyond the Chinese-speaking community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.112" offset="7489202">It affects the hundreds of thousands of Spanish-speaking children in our society who although their ancestors predate my own and many Caucasians in this country still do not speak the English language, still are the objects of societal forms of discrimination and still in the context of this case are effectively excluded from any participation in the educational process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.825" offset="8256052">We believe that the Congress has considered in its language the question which is presented to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.188" offset="8285518">It presented this not only in terms of mandating regulations which deal with the issue and specifically the National Origin Memorandum which flows lawfully from that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.826" offset="8328046">But it dealt with it in Section 602 of the Act in which the United States Congress provided that each federal department, in this case HEW, which is empowered to extend federal financial assistance, is authorized indeed the languages directed to effectuate the provisions of Section 601, the basic three protections consistent with the achievement of the statute which authorizes the expenditure of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.601" offset="8439118">In other words, Section 601 protections are to be defined in part by the objectives to be served by the funding program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.066" offset="8472973">In this particular case, there are two critically important funding programs which give meaning and content to 601 and that is the bilingual programs under Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and Title I of ESEA which focuses federal money on disadvantaged children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.810" offset="8547997">In both cases, the Congress recognized that HEW would be attempting to serve the children who are petitioners in this case with those programs and thereby said specifically that Section 602 would incorporate the meaning of those programs into 601, the basic protections of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.359" offset="13906233">That’s correct Mr. Justice Douglas and that’s what I wanted to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.533" offset="13926922">You mentioned in your decision and correctly, properly and rightly so that under the Education Code of California, there was a provision not repealed until 1947 that that could be provided for Chinese, Japanese and children of Mongolian origin, separate schools and if separate schools were provided, these children could not attend other schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.226" offset="14057639">Now, I can speak from the experience now of 50 years and research, confirms it that in San Francisco, there has not been a separate school under this statute as far as any children of San Francisco are concerned, including Chinese children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.290" offset="14157949">And it is a fact that the Chinese like the Irish and Italians who first settled around the Chinatown area when they fanned out over the city to the various neighborhoods and went to the neighborhood schools, the Chinese children did so as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.069" offset="14257006">And I ran across which I think the Court might be interested in, a recent book called “Longtime California: A documentary study of an American Chinatown” by Victor and Barry Nee, and on account of interview with Lee-Lun Chin who is now age 73 and is one of the staff of the Young China Daily, stated that he left San Francisco after the fire and earthquake and went up to a small town under Sacramento River and when his father found that he couldn’t attend a school there, he returned to San Francisco and went to lower high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.411" offset="14470374">He says, “Well in 1910, my parents sent me back to San Francisco because Orientals weren’t allowed in the schools down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.060" offset="14497019">I was going to a Lowell High School and there I met some young Chinese students.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.486" offset="14514678">At Lowell High School, we’ve mentioned on our brief was then and is now the Academic High School in San Francisco where as we mentioned in our brief, the Chinese have a greater percentage in that school than their citywide percentages for high school students as the Academic School of San Francisco and in 1910, Mr. Chin went there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.272" offset="14625855">That documents of course what I know to be the fact that the Chinese as with others moved out into the schools of San Francisco.</text>

            <text syncTime="5375.982" offset="21580696">The school system has admitted even before this lawsuit was brought that these students cannot learn, that they are inevitably doomed, that they are frustrated by their inability to understand the regular word, that is a quote that appears at the appendix page 101.</text>

            <text syncTime="5405.457" offset="21698560">Mr. O’Conner says today the situation as such that 1,445 students are affected.</text>
