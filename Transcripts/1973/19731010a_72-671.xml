            <label>Mr. George Cooper</label>
            <text syncTime="37.813" offset="254621">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.764" offset="262457">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.643" offset="269981">With me today is my co-counsel in this case, Mr. Ruben Montemayor of San Antonio, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.524" offset="301432">The petitioner in this case, Mrs. Espinoza, is a lawfully admitted, permanent resident alien of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.259" offset="332361">She is married to an American citizen and has two children who are American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.713" offset="354200">She applied for a job and was denied the job solely because she, herself is not a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.444" offset="389099">And an issue in this case is whether this form of exclusion or discrimination against Mrs. Espinoza is prohibited by Federal Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.426" offset="429119">The primary construction -- the primary construction to be made in this case is whether the National Origin Discrimination Prohibition in Title VII applies to bar this form of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.569" offset="481677">In beginning the argument, Your Honors, I would like to clarify exactly what our position is and remove some distractions from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.422" offset="513024">First of all, it should be clear that there is no question whatever that aliens, as persons or individuals, are in fact protected by Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.361" offset="560776">The scope of Title VII is not limited to citizens that includes aliens, non-citizens as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.917" offset="583032">The only question is, what they are protected against.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.726" offset="598288">Second, Your Honors, and this is most important because it’s an element of confusion in the case for many persons, myself for a long time included.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.414" offset="632978">It is not necessary for the Court in ruling in our favor on the Title VII argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.913" offset="658996">It is not necessary for this Court to find that discrimination on the grounds of citizenship or nationality is in its own terms prohibited by Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.668" offset="702046">Our basic position is that citizenship discrimination is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.377" offset="724929">Our basic position is that Title VII bars national origin discrimination and that phrase should be interpreted to cover any non-merit related discrimination on any ground which relates to national origin and nationality so relates.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.551" offset="793579">Nationality is non-related to merit in performing a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.155" offset="816044">It is related to national origin and therefore discrimination on grounds of nationality should be interpreted as covered by Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.337" offset="856691">But, we do not press, your Honors, to go that far in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.739" offset="874350">It is not necessary because whether or not, Title VII -- the national origin phrase in Title VII, whether or not that is interpreted to include nationality, it should be clear that the citizenship requirement of Farah is a requirement which has a discriminatory impact in terms of national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.098" offset="979780">The citizenship requirement is like the test or a high school diploma requirement that was before this Court in Griggs against Duke Power Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.623" offset="1021889">It is standard which although it may be neutral on its face, it’s a standard which has a definite and decided adverse impact in national origin terms and that impact alone is ample to cause the citizenship standard to be declared unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.520" offset="1101406">There are two ways in which the citizenship requirement has this adverse effect in national origin terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.048" offset="1147591">First, it has an adverse impact directly related to a person’s place of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.255" offset="1180400">One aspect of national origin, taking the term national origin simply and literally, one aspect of someone’s national origin is where they themselves originate -- where they themselves are born.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.469" offset="1237243">The respondents apparently would deny or ignore that fact and say that national origin means ethnic origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.822" offset="1270680">But the statute doesn’t say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.562" offset="1281651">The statute doesn’t say ethnic origins.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.030" offset="1291473">There’s nothing in the legislative history of the statute that says ethnic origins.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.072" offset="1307669">The statute says national origins and there are various aspects of national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.502" offset="1329403">One aspect of a person’s national origin is where his ancestors, his forbearers come from, his ethnic origins.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.550" offset="1365556">But another aspect of an individual’s national origin is where he himself comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.277" offset="1392515">And if an employer discriminates against an individual because of his birthplace, he is discriminating in national origin terms and his act should be prohibited by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.075" offset="1439640">Now, Farah Manufacturing Company has not gone so far as to openly and clearly discriminating terms of place of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.785" offset="1478510">We admit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.705" offset="1482167">They don’t say, “We hire only people born in the United States and no one born abroad.”</text>
            <text syncTime="351.058" offset="1507558">If they had said that, I think it would be -- the case would be easy.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.956" offset="1595225">They have a -- Most of the Farah employees are born in this country but they don’t restrict their employment to only persons born in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.329" offset="1624691">They restrict the employment to citizens and of course, some citizens are persons who were born abroad, but that doesn’t alter the fact that the citizenship requirement is a requirement which has a definite, clear mark decided, adverse impact in terms of a person’s place of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.245" offset="1704312">If you are born in one place, the United States, the citizenship requirement is essentially meaningless to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.162" offset="1732002">Your citizenship has been handed to you by virtue of your birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.049" offset="1747571">But if you were born any other place, but in the United States, you must undergo a serious and restrictive and difficult process to gain citizenship, the process of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.495" offset="1797308">And any standard which imposes a harsher, more difficult burden on persons because of their place of birth is a standard which has a discriminatory impact in terms of the individual’s national origin.</text>

            <label>Mr. George Cooper</label>
            <text syncTime="452.888" offset="1914964">Well, that would not relate -- that would not relate to national origin in terms of the way it excluded other people from other parts of the United States but it would relate to national origin in terms of discriminating against persons of foreign birth and we would have to assess the national origin impact of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.964" offset="1987271">Is the impact of a Texas restriction, a restriction which has a harsher effect on a foreign born than the American born.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.335" offset="2024678">That would be a question which we have to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.477" offset="2037321">I’m not sure what the facts would show.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.728" offset="2046307">But it’s quite clear that the citizenship requirement is a requirement which imposes a very differential burden on the American born as compared to the foreign born.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.763" offset="2098448">It’s just like the test in the Griggs case.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.011" offset="2115375">The test was one which was given to whites and blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.528" offset="2137527">It didn’t exclude all blacks just like the citizenship requirement, it doesn’t exclude all foreign born persons, but the test was one which the blacks had a more difficult time passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.532" offset="2185488">The test was something which operated as a built-in headwind against the blacks and it’s that built-in headwind making it more difficult for blacks in practice than whites to get jobs which caused the test to be declared unlawful in Griggs and so to the citizenship requirement which makes it more difficult for the foreign born to get a job than for the native born to get a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.099" offset="2279737">It’s a discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.854" offset="2286738">It’s a standard which has a discriminatory impact in national origin terms to the extent that national origin relates to an individual’s birthplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.677" offset="2342118">We think that point is simple and clear and that alone is a sufficient ground to sustain us, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.660" offset="2378062">But, if there are no questions on that point, let me go on to our second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.679" offset="2418082">That is that even if the Court wishes to ignore this discrimination in terms of place of birth which is the effect of the citizenship rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.200" offset="2484224">If the Court wants instead merely to look at ethnic discrimination, which is what the respondents urge, nonetheless, the citizenship requirement has a discriminatory impact, a discriminatory effect in terms of an individual’s ethnic background.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.270" offset="2564472">The citizenship requirement does not in practice and effect apply to all ethnic groups equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.031" offset="2591535">Rather, it imposes a harsher burden on some ethnic groups than on other ethnic groups which proves--</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.845" offset="4462738">The only response they have to that is to say, “Well, that may be true that that form of discrimination is unlawful in some cases” that discriminatory effect, but it’s not unlawful in our case because we hire a lot of Mexicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.167" offset="4519999">We hire a lot of Mexicans who are citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.974" offset="4535254">There are several reasons why that answer is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.296" offset="4548524">First of all, to the extent that the unlawful aspect of the discrimination is its special burden on the foreign born, its differential treatment of the foreign born as compared to the American born.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.016" offset="4623444">The hiring of Mexicans who are American born is no defense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.605" offset="4649775">It’s essentially an irrelevant answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.281" offset="4672449">Now, if we turn to the second way of looking at this case, analyzing in terms of the ethnic effect rather than the birthplace effect, it’s also not a sufficient answer to say, “We hire a lot of Mexicans” because the respondent has not established, first of all, that his hiring of a lot of Mexicans means that he hires other ethnic groups which may be adversely affected by the citizenship requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.129" offset="4803897">Second, it says nothing about whether or not at least one more person of Mexican background might not have been hired had he not imposed the citizenship requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.600" offset="4865755">And that’s all it takes, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.615" offset="4873801">All it takes is the possibility that one more Mexican might have been hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.326" offset="4892714">That’s all it takes to justify holding the standard unlawful because we are not here talking about any kind of standards which has anything whatsoever to do with job-relatedness, merit or ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.046" offset="4947571">We’re talking about a wholly arbitrary standard which the employer has not attempted to justify at all, and even at the minimized discriminatory effect should be enough to declare that kind of requirement unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.313" offset="5020609">So, for those two reasons, the discriminatory effect, the special burden which just imposes on a foreign born and also because of the discriminatory effect and special burden that this imposes on recent immigrant groups, not that the citizenship requirement should be declared unlawful under the general standard of the Griggs against Duke Power Company case that any special requirement or hurdle which is non-job related.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth R. Carr</label>
            <text syncTime="1842.470" offset="7473298">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.858" offset="7490853">In reading counsel’s description in this -- particularly in this brief of the plight of the American immigrant in the 1880’s and up to as recently as 45 or 50 years ago I was reminded of the remarks of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Sand Door case with the Carpenters Local 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.613" offset="7569847">Speaking of the secondary boycott problems in that case, it said that these afford a striking illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.896" offset="7594924">The importance of this is that it is the business of Congress to declare a policy and not this courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.111" offset="7619793">The judicial function is confined to applying what Congress has enacted after ascertaining what it is that Congress has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.836" offset="7654693">We’re presented here with a simple and narrow question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.967" offset="7683218">That is in 1964, did -- not should but did Congress intend to hold an employer’s policy of hiring only United States citizens where all parties acknowledged that that policy has been applied in a non-discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.848" offset="7750719">We think that the history of the Act clearly demonstrates that Congress had no such intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.594" offset="7777782">Before discussing the factors before the United States Congress and suggest -- note that there’s been only one case other than the District Court in this case which has applied national origin in a way that petitioner’s briefs suggest that it should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.122" offset="7851865">And that case is cited in petitioner’s brief as London Board of-- London Borough of Ealing versus Race Relations Board,and there, the Queen’s best division applied precisely, the statutory construction to a national origin statute in Great Britain that the petitioner seeks here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.806" offset="7938591">That decision was reversed by the House of Lords in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.148" offset="7960012">And aside from that one decision, nobody has yet agreed with counsel, aside from that one in the District Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.270" offset="7988433">Now, what was before the Congress in 1964?</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.434" offset="8001076">I’d suggest that the first and most obvious factor before the Court was that of the employment practices of the Federal Government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.268" offset="8040469">From 1914, for 50 years, eight or nine consecutive presidents beginning with President Wilson had required by Executive Order that in order to sit for Civil Service Examination, an individual must be a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.274" offset="8104417">Now, at various times, there were certainly very limited exceptions which I regard as totally irrelevant to the basic issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.449" offset="8137122">For the last 21 of those years, beginning in 1943 and under President Roosevelt, Trumann, Eisenhower and Kennedy, the same presidents who re-affirmed the necessity that Civil Service applicant must be a citizen by Executive Order also for bad discrimination based upon among other things, national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.319" offset="8232626">Now obviously, for 21 years, no one had raised the contention and no one had suggested to the Congress that these two policies could not co-exist side by side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.057" offset="8291558">This has been raised in one case that I’m aware of since 1964 in Mow Sun Wong versus Hampton in the Northern District of California in 1971 where a group of Chinese aliens, again, under statutory construction case, sued the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission when they were denied the right to sit for Civil Service Examination and they alleged that the Civil Service rule was in violation of what by then was statutory Federal Government Policy of not discriminating on the basis of national origin and the judge there said that there was no problem that the two statutes or the two policies could easily co-exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.364" offset="8468877">Is the case now before us the only case that you know of in the Courts involving this question under Title VII on Civil Rights Act of ’64?</text>

            <text syncTime="2103.246" offset="8516315">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.389" offset="8528959">The next area that was before the Congress when it was enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the fact that according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, some 28 states had enacted fair employment practices legislation at the time that Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.058" offset="8611610">The various fair employment practices commissions of those states in 19 -- pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.030" offset="8639509">One of the factors virtually all of these 28 for bad discrimination based early on national origin and/or national ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.848" offset="8678797">19 of these State Fair Employment Practices Commissions had discussed and considered the question of whether under their policy, an employer could still require citizenship.</text>
