            <label>Mr. Morton Jackson</label>
            <text syncTime="33.940" offset="212532">Mr. Chief Justice, thank you and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.508" offset="246805">I would like to address myself briefly, if the court please to the general approach taken by the board, arguing in support of its point of view with respect to the two specific limitations on its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.310" offset="338024">I'm speaking of the limitation contents in Section 10 (c) of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.258" offset="365819">The limitations contained in rule 65 particularly 65 (d) of the Federal rules of civil procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.057" offset="400927">I think those limitations are the ones that the board has attempted to dispense with in reaching the result that it's reached in this case on a successorship issue which is the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.454" offset="466547">The board and the writers tend to sweep these limitations aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.750" offset="487758">Of course the 10 (c) the heart of that again is that states that the board's remedial powers must be exercised only against those who have actually engaged in unfair labor practices or are engaging in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.224" offset="545646">And the language of Section 65 (d) which had such penetrating analysis in the Regal Knitwear case has to do with the circumstances under which a successor or an assigned maybe drawn within the ambit of an order directed to a wrong doer.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.503" offset="634776">Now, as I see the board tends to shut these off really by saying, first it is also in the same Section 10 (c) given broad remedial powers to effectuate the policies of the Act and consider them in light of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.871" offset="712202">At the end, it has in mind really justifies the means as taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.406" offset="738325">And it tends to treat the limitations imposed by the two Sections I just mentioned as something rather technical or rather arbitrary and arbitrary but technical at any rate, and something that must give away before an argument addressed to considerations of substance such as effectuating the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.558" offset="831007">In answer to that, I would say it first and I think again this is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.233" offset="853682">That both of these sections are not technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.928" offset="868415">Their terms and body provisions are of fundamental substance and they articulate fundamental protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.579" offset="911047">I think throughout it is well to bear in mind that what we are talking about is affording a party hearing, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.370" offset="946260">And that one of the vices inherent in what the board has done is to deny a party a hearing, but even more fundamental than that and even more profound a vice is the vice which lies in imposing sanctions for illegal conduct for wrong doing against the party who is guiltless of any wrong doing who is totally innocent of any wrongful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.486" offset="1050645">This is what we are getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.186" offset="1061512">So these are not just technical limitations, they're limitations which contain the expression, the embodiment of protections of considerable substance and can't simply be swept aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.281" offset="1113861">This --</text>

            <text syncTime="272.052" offset="1164957">It certainly was -- sort of went without saying in the Regal Knitwear case.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.776" offset="1187840">The language successors and the signs is regularly been used in these orders and that the --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="283.925" offset="1212500">Of course by its terms I always thought that Federal rules are applicable to the Federal Courts?</text>

          <turn speaker="morton_jackson" startTime="290.025" stopTime="473.841">
            <label>Mr. Morton Jackson</label>
            <text syncTime="290.025" offset="1236846">This is true, but I think that what the Court addressed itself to in the Regal Knitwear case was the fact that the courts are going to be called upon to enforce these orders and what Justice Jackson said in Regal Knitwear was that no order can be enforced, no order which contains language which exceeds the limitations of rule 65 (d) can be enforced by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.783" offset="1335902">And to the extent that the court's enforcement powers are limited, quite clearly they apply to the Labor Board also.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.133" offset="1373309">However, an answer to each of these considerations if each on its merit that the board is advanced is again contained in this very remarkable decision in the Regal Knitwear case.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.922" offset="1424405">I would invite the court's attention first off to a very transient statement of policy made by the Court in the Southern Steamship case, where it says it is sufficient for this case, this Court speaking again on this and justifying the means argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.640" offset="1499324">It is sufficient for this case to observe that the board has not been commissioned to effectuate the policies of the National Labor Relations Act so single-mindedly that it may ignore the equally important congressional objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.275" offset="1549897">Justice Jackson echoes this sentiment when he says in Regal Knitwear that this language about broader media powers in order to effectuate policies of the Act containing its own limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.194" offset="1609561">He points out in the following language that these powers must be exercised within the limits of the authority bestowed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.894" offset="1652297">Administrative agencies have considerable latitude to shape their remedies within the scope of their statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.651" offset="1691376">And then it goes on the say the courts may not grant in the celebrated language an enforcement order or an injunction so broad as to make punishable, a conduct the persons who act independently and whose rights have not been adjudged according to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.264" offset="1761802">Now, again it is suggested that by the writers and notably Professor Goldberg and the North Western Law Review who was cited by board and its brief at page 21 and indeed whose views find reflections throughout on the board's brief that Regal Knitwear doesn't really mean what it says, and in any event it has left the door open by language in giving two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.379" offset="1874233">The court gives two examples, it suggests for example the successive concept could apply in a situation where the successor was merely a disguised continuance of the predecessor, and therefore has a substantial identity with him or where the succession itself, the transfer has been utilized simply as a means of evading or avoiding trust to the force of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.121" offset="4041247">Now, Burns was considered as having some bearing in this case since it threw light upon the significance of the Wiley against Livingston decision on which the board in turn based its change of course in Perma Vinyl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.164" offset="4109375">And Burns was read by Judge Kilkenny who dissented it in the Court of Appeals, as narrowing the scope of Wiley in its application to this type of case, and in fact excluding its application to cases involving liability for unfair practices as distinct from the succession to the obligation of bargain, or the obligation of a collective bargaining agreement that resulted from a bargaining arrangement of the predecessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.089" offset="4245107">To return to the point I was making the argument of Justice Jackson or the language of Justice Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.931" offset="4324519">He touched down, I think is found as I say, Professor Goldberg suggests that there is an open door which leaves it wide open for other situations including the one before us that of an innocent successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.225" offset="4389616">But we suggest that is foreclosed by the language of the succeeding paragraph in which he points out the common aspect to both of these examples he is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.051" offset="4424934">He says "In both of these cases, the reference is not merely to succession, but to a relation between the defendant and the successor which might of itself establish liability within the terms of rule 65."</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.355" offset="4482194">We suggest we urge to the Court that that says plainly as anything could that an innocent successor as against to him, there is no independent basis for assessing liability who's guilty of no wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.932" offset="4528483">Who is not in the league with the predecessor or assisting him to evade the order or conspiring with him in a collusive manner to carry out this type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.664" offset="4575399">The term successor on a sign cannot reach out and bind such a person, because to do so would be offensive to due process, and to exceed the scope of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.522" offset="4638824">We urge therefore that these limitations are limitations of substance and cannot be swept aside or cannot be ignored in view of the other limited considerations which the board has advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.414" offset="4698384">And may suggest that to do so, amounts really to an exultation not merely a form, but of doctrine, at the sacrifice of fundamental law and of substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.470" offset="4754599">If I may briefly address myself to 1 or 2 of the practical or what we called in our brief, the policy considerations -- by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.565" offset="4802978">I would like to point out, if I may that the enforcement of the reinstatement remedy whether it's against a original employer, this is a well settled remedy and one with which we have no quarrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.033" offset="4868911">But in any event, and particularly against a successor who as we see has other than being no obligation whatever to hire any of his predecessor's employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.258" offset="4913737">It does work a hardship on the innocent employee who has to be displaced to make way for the rehired discriminatee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.728" offset="4955638">The argument is frequently seen only from the stand point of the discriminatee who is out of a job, who wants to be reinstated, and who is now remedied less because the business has changed counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.830" offset="5004016">It must be remembered that in order to accommodate even a respect, somebody else is going to have to be laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.902" offset="5028362">Also the argument that a successor can hire and that will work no hardship, and then if he proves to be a non-satisfactory employee, may fire him for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.370" offset="5086250">In such circumstances where the board tends to try as it's indicated in this case must frequently attempted to establish as board policy, a presumption that the successor is going to continue the unfair practices of the predecessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.479" offset="5150616">And given the burden which the employer has under this Court's Great Dane case to in effect establish that this discriminatory reason was not the reason for the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.482" offset="5202651">I think this is not a realistic argument, because with the tract record such as this, which is going to be raised against him, a successes is going to have a very difficult time discharging for cause and making it stand up against an 8 (a) (3) charge a purely practical matter. This is the way it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.298" offset="5269943">Also, by insisting on this type of remedial action, we should like to suggest again that a practical result if this were to become settled policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.682" offset="5319471">That successors would in examining this, to the extent that they were aware of it, would be more inclined to other things being equal to hire none of the predecessor's employees, and instead of promoting stability, he is likely to promote just the opposite result in order to avoid being classified as a successor, or in order to avoid being projected in to this uncertain and potentially expensive situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.157" offset="5449352">I think to most of the further questions, I would conclude with that to open end, if the Court please, reserve the balance of my time for reply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.587" offset="5795109">Well, I would agree that both of those issues are here and I'll try to answer them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.961" offset="5844637">It is undisputed that All American acquired through a bona fide a sale, the plant, the machinery, the accounts receivable, the trade name, and other assets of the Golden State Bottling operation that is retained virtually all of Golden State's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.295" offset="5921959">Including the 12 distributors and all of Golden State's supervisory and managerial employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.368" offset="5954247">Including the General Manager, Eugene Schilling who is the one who discharged the employee in question when he was general manager for Golden State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.979" offset="6008686">And it's further undisputed that All American continued to manufacture the same products, the same location, the same plant, and distribute them to the same customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.922" offset="6056438">I think we're all agreed on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.449" offset="6070544">Thus, All American would be a successor employer for purposes of the act not only under the test of the majority of the court in Burns, but also under the more stringent test of the dissenting Justices in Burns, which requires that the new employer not only take over the same employee complement, but he also succeed to some the tangible or intangible assets of the predecessor company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.180" offset="6189453">We have got that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.412" offset="6198439">Now, petitioners deny that All American had knowledge at the time of the sale of Golden State's un-remedied, unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.566" offset="6247027">The board found that the contrary in the Court of Appeals sustained that finding and normally under Universal Camera that issue would not be open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.461" offset="6294570">However, it was raised as a question in the petition and the grant of certiorari does not exclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.777" offset="6331873">So therefore, that issue is up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.895" offset="6352353">Now, with respect to that, we submit that there is adequate evidentiary support for the board's finding that All American had knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.145" offset="6393313">As I indicated before All American retained a general manager of the Bottling Operation, Eugene Schilling who had committed the unfair labor practice in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.323" offset="6442005">Schilling participated in one of the sale negotiating sessions with All American, at which among other things his retention as general manager was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.783" offset="6491847">Shortly thereafter with still before the sale was concluded, he met in the plant with a representative of All American and discussed general operations and “future plans”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.804" offset="6551928">He also signed the sales agreement of January 31, 1968 which agreement specifically provided for his retention as general manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.774" offset="6599889">In these circumstances we submit that the board could reasonably infer as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.133" offset="6625280">That Schilling had conveyed his knowledge of the pending unfair labor practice proceeding to All American at or before the consummation of the sale, or at a very least that Schilling’s knowledge thereof could properly be imputed to All Americans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.319" offset="7358067">I think which -- it's a situation which you have very often in many cases particularly Labor Board cases where you have to draw inferences from the total circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.523" offset="7426821">And one of these circumstances in addition to the previous one that I had outlined, is the fact that the denials were discredited by the trial examiner for the reason that he found that not only had Crofoot and Schilling contradicted themselves in their testimony before him, but there were a series of documents that they had signed in the course of this litigation which either concealed or failed to disclose the sale of All American, to both the board and to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.098" offset="7649176">Thus, in November 1968, more than six months after the sale and his authority to act for Golden State had entered, Schilling executed a letter and substitution of counsel in the Court below as General Kyle, manager of Golden State Bottling company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.364" offset="7722214">On December 11, 1968 as President of Golden State, he signed a notice to employees required by the board’s order and sent the board a certification to that effect in the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.493" offset="7778743">On behalf of Golden State he offered Baker the wrongfully discharged employee reinstatement as a driver salesman not withstanding the fact that almost a year ago or previous his authority to act in behalf of Golden State had ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.959" offset="7844571">And on November 24th 1969 more than 21 months after the sale, Crofoot as President of Golden State verified under penalty of perjury, the answer to the board's original back pay specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.046" offset="7912908">And that answer made no mention of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.598" offset="7927118">Alleged that Golden State had offered Baker reinstatement on December 11th more than 10 months after he'd gone out of the Bottling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.262" offset="7965780">On the basis of all of these factors, we submit that the trial examiner was warranted in discrediting the denials of Crofoot and Schilling that they did not tell.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.567" offset="8619050">Section 10 (c) of the Act authorizes the board the issue of remedial the orders against any person named in the complaint who was engaged in any unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.165" offset="8669414">However, from the beginning, board orders have covered not only the person found of committed the unfair labor practice, but its officers, agents, successors, and assigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.996" offset="8720718">And this Court has recognized that those orders could be applied not only to one who is merely a diguised continuance of the old employer, but also inappropriate circumstances, and I'm reading from Regal Knitwear.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.466" offset="8782576">To those to whom the business may have been transferred, whether as a means of evading the judgment, or for other reasons”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.592" offset="8823118">Now the question whether a successor was in the meeting of the board’s order, they properly include not only an alter ego, or an aider, or a better of the old employer, but also a bona fide purchaser where it continues the employing entity which was the locus of the unfair labor practices, and it acquires that entity with knowledge that the predecessor has failed to remedy those unfair labor practices, turns on an appraisal or the policies of the Act and also of Rule 65 (d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.997" offset="8980689">Now as to the policy to the Act, in Burns, this Court held that the policies of the Act were effectuated by imposing on a wholly independent new employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.522" offset="12338887">Now Rule 65 (d) says that an injunctive order shall be binding on the parties of the action and persons acting in concert, and participation with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.984" offset="12528640">Now, and furthermore that the reason that you have that limitation is that you don't want an injunction binding someone whose rights have not been adjudicated by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.061" offset="14204970">I would like if I may, in the time remaining to address myself to the two questions posed by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.489" offset="14226704">First, the question of the significance of the Burn’s case in this case, and Judge Wiley, or Judge Kilkenny's reliance upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.700" offset="14271530">We have prefaces by recalling that the board’s original position was premised on Wiley, or in the Regal Knitwear and the Symns Grocer decision of the board was premised on Regal Knitwear and the Birdsall-Stockdale cases that came as a consequence of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.808" offset="14348016">The change of position in Perma Vinyl in the board's rationale did not deal with these cases but went instead to the language of Wiley to support its change of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.460" offset="14402560">Burns contained language which suggested that Wiley did not support that view, in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.564" offset="14430981">We do not find Wiley controlling in the circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.877" offset="14444251">Wiley arouse in the context of the Section 301 suit to compel arbitration, not in the context of an unfair practice proceeding where the board is expressly limited by the provisions of Section 8 (d) The decision emphasized the preference of National Labor Policy for arbitration as a substitute for a test of strength and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.194" offset="14517499">But that language in Burn suggested that Wiley was not authority for imposing successorship by ability for unfair labor practices, but that it was confined to this question of an assumption of contractual obligations which is the Court in Mailey said were essentially consensual in origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.767" offset="14607778">To the other question posed by Mr. Justice White concerning a common law -- State law regarding the obligations of a successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.734" offset="14651664">We have cited two cases in our brief, we have not quoted extensively from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.445" offset="14666501">They're on page 37 of our opening brief Schwartz against McGraw-Edison, and Kloberdanz against Joy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.207" offset="14697535">But I'd like if I may to quote from those cases as we did in our brief before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.612" offset="14719164">In the McGraw case, which was a California case, there was this language "We find that the criteria again are very similar to those outlined by the Court in Regal Knitwear."</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.113" offset="14761169">As a general rule where a corporation sells or otherwise transfers all its assets, its transferee is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.316" offset="14798054">And that liability of a new corporation for the debts of another corporation does not result from the mere fact the former's organize to succeed the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.117" offset="14829192">It is generally held that if one corporation purchases the assets of another and pays a fair consideration, therefore, no liability for the debts of the selling corporation exists in the absence of fraud, or agreement to assume the debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.536" offset="14874854">There are certain instances however, in which the purchaser or transferee may become liable and then they go on to specify a few of these where there is an expressed or implied agreement of assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.749" offset="14923755">But the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger, but the transaction was fraudulent where some elements of the purchase of good faith were lacking.</text>

            <text syncTime="3754.440" offset="15094491">We indicated that the identity of the unit before and after the transfer is of course pertinent in determining whether or not a new expression of employee choice for the bargaining representative, would have go through this exercise, and this makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.806" offset="15163977">But in applying this to determine whether or not a person is a successor and has becoming a term of art, for purposes of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.651" offset="15199399">I suspect as practical matter, the board has said to itself, if there is substantial identity of unit, and of personnel, and of work then it's highly probable that but for this discrimination the man would've been hired, and I suggest this is probably the reason for this criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.745" offset="15283722">On the implied or the imputation of knowledge argument, I should like, if I may to point out to the Court, that one of the principal arguments advanced for this knowledge requirement is that if affords to the purchaser the ability to protect himself against this possible liability by indemnity agreements in this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.331" offset="15382047">However, by resorting to this imputation argument, which the board in effect is taking away this protection, because by having to resort to such a fictional device in order to result in a finding of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.637" offset="15451324">The board is in effect seeding effect that no actual knowledge existed on the part of this purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.729" offset="15483716">And therefore this opportunity to protect itself and to investigate the possibility of the extent to which this might result in liability, did not in fact exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.251" offset="15525721">And I think this is another aspect of the thing which argues the frailty of this argument.</text>
