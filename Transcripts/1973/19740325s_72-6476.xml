            <text syncTime="10.800" offset="119954">This case comes to here from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.751" offset="135732">The petitioner has brought this case, challenging certain New York State welfare regulations on the grounds that the regulations violated Equal Protection Clause and were also inconsistent with the Social Security Act and various implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.926" offset="208457">They ask for a declaratory judgment and an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.777" offset="223817">A single district judge did not pass on the constitutional claim, but did sustain the supremacy clause claim, that is the claim that the regulations were in conflict with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.502" offset="282749">The Court Appeals reversed, holding that the constitutional claim was not substantial and that therefore the district court had no jurisdiction whatsoever over either the constitutional claim or the statutory conflict claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.950" offset="356519">We granted the petition for cert and we now reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.818" offset="376059">We hold that the constitutional claim was sufficient to support the jurisdiction of the District Court and that it was proper for the single district judge to proceed, to consider the so called statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.734" offset="459651">Accordingly the judgment the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.837" offset="476056">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed the dissenting opinion joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
