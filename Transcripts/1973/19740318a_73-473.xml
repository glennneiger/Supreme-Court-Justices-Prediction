            <text syncTime="46.864" offset="264255">There are two basic parts to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.760" offset="275749">One, going to the exercise of the summary contempt's power, the other going to the right to trial by jury in cases of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.485" offset="310648">With respect to the first part, the petitioner contends that this Court should hold that even if the trial judge is going to be allowed to proceed summarily, there is a minimal entitlement to a hearing, notice of a charge, opportunity to respond and judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.380" offset="382224">Secondly, he would contend that in the circumstances of this case, the trial judge, the respondent here was so personally embroiled in controversy with the petitioner that he could not impartially sit in judgment on the multiple contempt charges that he leveled against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.186" offset="445544">We would also ask this Court to consider, the issue having been briefed by the parties, whether the summary contempt power itself is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.078" offset="521091">The -- nor was it specifically raised as such in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.547" offset="546900">It seemed to me that as we were developing these arguments before the Court, it was impossible to separate the inherent unfairness in the exercise of the summary contempt power, from question such as the right to a hearing, the embroilment of a particular judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.713" offset="615549">If I may draw an analogy, it seems that long ago, this Court has recognized that the summary contempt power is arbitrary in its nature and is subject to abuse and over the years it’s worked out various refines.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.927" offset="676467">For example, under Federal Rule 42 (a) the charges must be specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.634" offset="695275">It’s developed a doctrine of embroilment in controversy of bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.140" offset="713352">Now, we’re asking the Court to come up with still another correction on the doctrine such as to make it clear that there is the right to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.842" offset="748147">It seems to me that the Court in so doing is merely treating symptoms, in that the Court might wish to consider in this case going to the disease itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.030" offset="784823">And the disease, we feel is the summary contempt power which combines in it the inherently inconsistent functions of prosecutor, judge and jury and the same individual who is necessarily involved in the events leading up to the charge and this is why --</text>

            <text syncTime="231.665" offset="1003416">The problem of the embroiled judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.903" offset="1012402">The problem of the non-embroiled judge, who may try as best he or she can impartially to sit in judgment, but still cannot separate his role from prosecuting judge and trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.278" offset="1057855">I think that it is necessary to -- If I say so, in order to ensure proper respect for the administration of justice in this country, we must put the responsibility where it lies and that responsibility is on the Court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.101" offset="1121176">The summary contempt power I would submit produces far more disrespect for the administration of justice than any act, a disruptive client or a lawyer could do and I think the exercise of that power in the case at bar shows the disrespect that can result.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Allen Sedler</label>
            <text syncTime="294.471" offset="1254609">I would take the position of going back one step before.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.318" offset="1274044">We -- in the first place I would respectfully dispute that there was any improper conduct on the part of the present petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.124" offset="1301211">The Court did not grant certiorari on the issues of whether the conduct constituted criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.256" offset="1325767">But I would submit that the petitioner here did nothing more than vigorously defend to the best of his ability his client charged with a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.415" offset="1362442">But armed with the summary contempt power, the respondent in this case could proceed as an activist seeking combat, knowing that any time he got the worst of the exchange he could always invoke the summary contempt power.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.259" offset="1437780">I think that comes out most clearly on contempt number three where the trial judge had said to the petitioner and counsel for the other defendant, you may have this blackboard in the courtroom and you may write on the blackboard the inconsistent statements that the tape of the key prosecution witness showed and counsel and co-counsel for the co-defendant did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.649" offset="1531298">At the end of this, the trial judge suddenly says, “Mr. Sheriff, remove the blackboard from the room.”</text>
            <text syncTime="369.863" offset="1556167">Petitioner files an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.040" offset="1564944">The trial judge overrules him with a sarcastic comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.085" offset="1581140">The time to -- right in front of the jury, the time to argue your case is at the close of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.470" offset="1602664">The petitioner responded and replied, “I certainly keep that in mind Your Honor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="386.891" offset="1624294">The trial judge though had the summary contempt power.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.298" offset="1633907">He says contempt six months in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.942" offset="1644565">Now this I submit is just fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.819" offset="1660029">It’s also interesting to note that the case that I think this part is concerned about so called courtroom disruption, the so called Chicago Seven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.304" offset="1697959">When it was tried before a judge appointed by Your Honor who was not certainly and personally embroiled in controversy, this judge found that every act of the lawyer defendants and every act of the non-lawyer defendants accept coming into Court with judicial robes that he find contemptuous was a response albeit an excessive one to preemptory action on behalf of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.266" offset="1801822">I think the danger of the existence of the summary contempt power maybe threefold, yet encourages judges to act arbitrarily and tyrannically knowing that they can always come down with the summary contempt power on a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.252" offset="1873711">Secondly, it inhibits, it has a showing effect on vigorous and effect to that because if the lawyer was found by the trial judge to have overstepped the line, the trial judge doesn’t have to warn or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.861" offset="1928150">The trial judge is the trial judge did in this case and just say contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.383" offset="1946331">This causes a lawyer to pull his punches.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.893" offset="1960333">Thirdly, I think that the exercise of the summary contempt power causes the public to lose confidence in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.410" offset="1998367">When the public sees a judge sitting up there as judge, jury and prosecute him and meeting out sentences totaling four and a half years, this I do think brings across the notion, well, what kind of justice is there if a judge can do this and so I think it is in the interest of the administration of justice that the summary contempt power with its inherent unfairness be given a well deserved determent by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.765" offset="2155833">I take it if the judge is going to retain any control of the proceeding, there has got to be something that makes counsel for each side to pull his punches on occasion, the Court has indicated their particular line of questioning will be prohibited or something like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="872.627" offset="3567282">Now again, we are not saying that the lawyer cannot be punished for criminal contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.662" offset="3691416">Moreover, in a criminal proceeding in which the accused faced originally four-and-a-half years imprisonment and now it was cut down to six months so as to defeat the claim of the jury trial, you have the trial judge performing the necessarily inconsistent functions of prosecutor, jury and judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.302" offset="3765917">I think that is one of the crucial things that’s wrong with the criminal contempt power.</text>

            <text syncTime="963.594" offset="3931115">Certainly at a minimum in this case, the Court should hold that there is a right to a hearing, and by a hearing I mean a separation, events on the spot, a separation of the contempt proceedings from the other events involved in the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.221" offset="5189590">Well, depending on the view that the court takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.675" offset="5199412">My -- the point that I -- the submission that I would make is that -- is that contempt of court as defined by recent decisions of this Court such as the little case, necessarily constitutes a serious offense within the meaning of the trial by jury guarantee because it is the kind of offense, this material, intentional obstruction to the administration of justice that is likely to be regarded as contrary to the ethics of the community and secondly, there are some subsidiary arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.273" offset="5337861">Many of the criminal contempt cases involved lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.422" offset="5350400">Lawyers do suffer collateral consequences which should be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.217" offset="5369626">Moreover, the court itself is sitting in judgment on a contempt charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.721" offset="5395644">If justice must serve the appearance of justice, there is something again seriously questionable about a court sitting in judgment on the charge of contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.701" offset="5443500">But I think that those are subsidiary arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.225" offset="5457607">I think the major argument is that contempt is a serious offense because it is so regarded by the society as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.149" offset="5501388">And I think in this regard it is because criminal contempt has been defined by this Court not merely to include so called disrespect to the person of the trial judge, but as requiring an actual intentional material obstruction to the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.035" offset="5568888">At least the Court should hold that where there is the possibility of substantial imprisonment, let’s say beyond the ten days approved in the Dyke case, that contempt --</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.707" offset="5671602">It seems to me, going on to that point, that the Sixth Amendment speaks in clear terms of all criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.033" offset="5704829">And just as the Court has held that an attorney, I am sorry, attorney is required in all criminal prosecutions so too a jury trial should be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.451" offset="5750596">The only difference is the historical genealogy of the right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.593" offset="5775151">But when the Court has been dealing with the Seventh Amendment’s right to trial by jury in civil cases, it’s disregarded historical practice, even though under the clean up doctrine enacting the word historically equitable, the court could award damages without a jury, this Court has held that every time there is a claim for damages, there must be the right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.117" offset="5865221">It seems to me that the terms of the Sixth Amendment are just as clear and that regardless of the historical practice, the clear thrust of the Sixth Amendment is to require the right to trial by jury in every case where any imprisonment is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.725" offset="6339605">And my point was that merely because he has a right to appeal trial errors, it doesn’t mean that he can ignore the trial errors at the time that he has -- they have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.273" offset="6385789">His duty to his client requires him to try to correct the trial error before the judge because those errors cumulatively could have an impact on the trial even though taken by themselves, they might not constitute substantial and reversible error.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.669" offset="6551406">So one of the things that I think appears from the record in this case, Your Honor was at no time that the trial judge say during the trial, “Mr. Taylor, I want you to stop this behavior, I want you to stop this line of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.978" offset="6600620">You are heading towards the line where advocacy becomes contempt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.841" offset="6620160">There was sort as if the judge was waiting and waiting and then either something hit him personally or he thought the line was crossed and he pounced on contempt, as he put it in his tirade from the bench, “I have you nine counts of contempt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.841" offset="6684108">And I think that during the course of the trial, yes, there comes a time when the trial judge must be able to say to the lawyer, argument is stopped on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.686" offset="6727471">If you have any further thing you want to say to the appellate court, say it in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.900" offset="6756310">And I think at that point, if the lawyer proceeds he could be cited for a contempt and although this court has not granted certiorari on the substantive contempt charges, I think a cursory examination of the charges almost on their face will reveal that they do not constitute criminal contempt under the standards promulgated by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.326" offset="6962051">It is our position and we think the record completely sustains it that all during the trial and in each time the petitioner were cited for a contempt by Judge Hayes that he was indeed given a reasonable opportunity to be heard and in most instances he took it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.946" offset="7036552">So it is our position here that this is really not a question of law, but a question of fact as to whether or not this 15-volume transcript sustains a position that Taylor was indeed given a chance to be heard on the contempts and whether or not he was given the right to state the mitigating factors which if no allocution does exist in a summary contempt proceeding he would be entitled to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.968" offset="7140624">It is our contention that the record does indeed show that each instance that he gave the mitigating circumstances of which he was aware, these included a marriage, a funeral, working without pay, long hours of being tired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.881" offset="7200287">So first it is our position that the record sustained a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.418" offset="7438420">And in affirming or rather refusing to grant a writ of habeas corpus, this Court said that there was a right of instant apprehension and imprisonment with no allocution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.044" offset="7580944">The premise of the case was that there was no allocution as it is explicitly stated in the federal rules that is the right of -- to speak at the time of the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.086" offset="7629113">However, in Sacher the same kind of allocution occurred as occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.057" offset="7652937">Throughout the nine-month trial there was continuous dialogue between Judge Medina and the lawyers involved and there couldn’t be of much doubt that everybody was pretty aware of what was transpiring and that this Court did not set aside that conviction because of a right -- because of no hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.985" offset="7752725">And this is -- it seems to be the hearing, the procedure all through in the Sarafite case, the Ungar-Sarafite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.184" offset="7781460">Again, there was a lot of dialogue in the trial between Judge Sarafite and Unger who was on the witness stand during the trial of Hulan Jack and I think the hearing took two days -- placed two days after the trial, Ungar appeared with a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.609" offset="7851154">The lawyer moved for continuance and Judge would give him a continuance, he withdrew from the case and then Ungar, all he said was “I am not feeling well and I’d like a continuance,” and that was the allocution in that case and this Court held that conviction sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.964" offset="7916565">Now, next I would like to turn very quickly to the right of a trial by jury in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.033" offset="7964839">The highest court in the Commonwealth of Kentucky has said that his ultimate sentence to be served is six months.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.194" offset="8101512">It is said under the rule in Cheff, when the legislature has not expressed a judgment as to the seriousness of an offense fixing a maximum penalty which may be imposed, we are to look to the penalty actually imposed as to the best evidence of the seriousness of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.236" offset="10053695">That is correct sir, that’s exactly what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.897" offset="10068323">Now, it is our position Mr. Justice, and may it please the Court that at the time of sentence, the trial that occurred on the matter of contempt and at some point in imposing the punishment, a judge must have the last say and the last word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.784" offset="10143869">The right to be heard, we say had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.432" offset="10162469">The reasons for mitigation and defense had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.143" offset="10177306">It is not uncommon for judges at the end of a trial and I am not speaking only of lawyers at this point, I am speaking of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.141" offset="10221296">Suppose a judge hears a particularly aggravated case that just shocks of conscience of any human being, it is not uncommon for state and federal judges and I have heard them both do it, to just absolutely take the punishment apart or defendant apart when he imposes sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.461" offset="10298619">Otherwise, there wouldn't be much reason for the disparity in some of the sentences that are imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.597" offset="10327144">With the sentencing power in the federal court, certainly the aggravating circumstances of a particular crime or a set of circumstances will cause a federal district judge to impose a larger sentence than a lesser sentence or even to probate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.922" offset="10396421">And we say that just because a judge comes down hard on the defendant at the time he imposes a sentence is not a predisposition of hostility, particularly when we claim that the bias or a plain bias throughout this 15-volume record is just absolutely not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.685" offset="10483461">And that’s absolutely what we feel about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.387" offset="10494328">Let me address myself, if I may just for a moment, excuse me sir, [Attempt to Laughter] if I may to this proposition that whenever a summary of contempt occurs that the trial judge must recuse himself and allow it to be heard by another judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.490" offset="10574681">Let’s take a very practical question and Mr. Justice Marshall alluded to it in a question to Mr. Sedler, when he asked which Court would hear this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.140" offset="10617313">Let’s take Father Groppi’s case in Michigan, where the people were led through the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.658" offset="10643331">And let’s assume that the Michigan general assembly was in joint session, the Senate and the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.069" offset="10669035">They cite Father Groppi for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.554" offset="10678962">Now the fact that they saw this, they heard this, which legislative body is going to try that contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.618" offset="10707174">Let’s assume that if a trial judge is going to have to recuse himself in other cases, let’s see now whose going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.009" offset="10752836">Is it going to be his brother trial judge in the same district or the same circuit or in the same state?</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.267" offset="10773838">Must it go outside the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.654" offset="10783347">Is it going to occur as it occurred in the Codispoti case which I understand is going to be heard here next week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.963" offset="10812604">Codispoti got his second judge and what he said to the second judge was about as bad as what was that.[Voice Overlap]</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.470" offset="10890658">In the Groppi case, I think the opinion indicated rather clearly that had they seized him immediately and proceeded with contempt, there might have been a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.527" offset="10930887">It was because Groppi went away and then without notice to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.124" offset="10949277">He was in jail for disorderly conduct and two days later without the present hearing, notice of papers they imposed a punishment, that is exactly right Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.487" offset="10990655">But would the bias or the disqualification be any less because Father Groppi led the group pass the Wisconsin legislature you say, then the contempt occurring before a trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.559" offset="11055020">We think not and we think that this displays some fallacy in the proposition that they must be heard by another judge or by some other forum and perhaps that can be dealt with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.456" offset="11126596">We think that the most important factor and the most important protection of a judge and of a lawyer involved in the criminal contempt case is that it appears on the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.930" offset="11196500">There is a record that an appellate court can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.775" offset="11215830">And this is somewhat followed by a -- stated by the Weisberg case out in the Ninth Circuit that when these things appear on the record, this prevent a judge without any court reporter, without any witnesses must do it in public, prevents any abuse in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.049" offset="11300989">Bringing my argument to an end here, we think that for two-week period and including the ultimate part here, Judge Hayes did a pretty good job in this trial if he’d imposed a punishment on Taylor at the time the contempt is heard -- were heard, he could claim a psychological disadvantage to hurt his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.863" offset="11412167">If he didn’t cite him for contempt and did nothing then they would be a claim that he discreetly searched the record after all this occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.794" offset="11447902">What he did was at that the time they occurred was to cite him, permit him to be heard in practically all instances and then at the end of the trial, he imposed the punishments that he thought proper and then he corrected them as the petitioner has conceded, he had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.961" offset="11536614">We think that it is highly necessary for the integrity of the judiciary which protects the freedom of us all, that this judgment be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.738" offset="11607667">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.148" offset="11621355">I think I have a comment on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.425" offset="11634416">Mr. Triplett says that the petitioner had the right to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.768" offset="11655837">The record of course which Mr. Triplett refers, shows that this simply was not so, but more importantly what we are in agreement on is that there was no hearing insofar as the petitioner had a chance to respond to them was only on counts two and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.017" offset="11724800">The response was strictly for the record and it occurred at a time when the petitioner was required to argue substantive questions to protect the interests of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.313" offset="11765969">At least the court should hold that due process requires a hearing in the sentence that the summary contempt, if this Court is going to allow it to go on, be separated from the other events in the case that the trial judge specify the charge which never occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.049" offset="11832947">He didn’t specify the charge until three months later, specify the charges, listen objectively to argument, to matters in defense or mitigation and then make a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.869" offset="11876206">With respect to the matter of embroilment what the respondent says as well, ignore my remarks at the time of sentencing, but there is no comment about everything else that occurred during and after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.900" offset="11928346">This -- of course, it is a burden to prove embroilment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.151" offset="11941303">Here, the respondent was not to very subtle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.534" offset="11954887">He says to the petitioner before the jury, I am going to make an example of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.656" offset="11971396">I am going to do something the bar says they should have done years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.915" offset="11984457">It’s true that there were no epithets hurled at the judge by the petitioner, but it was just a reverse when the judge sent -- when the petitioner argued I may have four or five months of my life tied up in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.830" offset="12032104">The judge said “Acidly before it’s over you might have a lot more than that,” provoking all the time, “You’re putting on the show, I don’t like your utters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.077" offset="12069094">Then he said, “You’ve accused me of rigging the jury,” all this occurs very early and throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.868" offset="12100232">And then there is the acts of the judge where he says “You can’t practice in my court anymore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.719" offset="12119667">He refused to hold a bail hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.677" offset="12127504">He used to admit the petitioner to bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.790" offset="12135863">Now if this does not show embroil then what I think the Court must be saying is that there is no such concept of being embroiled in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.312" offset="12174002">But it does raise the question of the -- what I call the inherent unfairness of the exercise of the summary contempt power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.644" offset="12211304">This case does present both narrow and broad issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.299" offset="12229904">The petitioner has not only argued his own case and has not limited himself to the narrow issues that would result in a reversal of the petitioner’s conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.760" offset="12275775">The petitioner believes that the issues presented in this case go far beyond the present petitioner and the present respondent and have deep implications for the administration of justice itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.389" offset="12322273">Petitioner would ask this Court to reverse his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.721" offset="12335647">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
