            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">The disposition of the following three opinions, 72-1470, Bob Jones University against Simon; 72-1371, Alexander against Americans United; and 73-5412, Dillard against the Industrial Commission of Virginia will be announced by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>

            <text syncTime="24.261" offset="173767">The first of these, Bob Jones against Simon, is a case that involves the application of the Anti-Injunction Act of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.941" offset="216503">The Internal Revenue Service has a ruling letter program, pursuant to which organizations deemed entitled the tax exempt status are identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.123" offset="265195">If an organization is on the tax exempt list, published periodically by the Service, contribution for donors to the organizations are deductible under Section 170 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.454" offset="326531">Petitioner, a private university, was notified by the Service that its tax exempt status would be revoked because of racial discriminatory admission policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.740" offset="379716">In addition to affecting donors, revocation would result in petitioner paying income and other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.664" offset="419422">This suit was brought to enjoin the Service from revoking a previously issued favorable ruling letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.227" offset="457665">The Anti-Injunction Act provides that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.284" offset="509910">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the Act precludes injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.116" offset="541257">We affirm this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.393" offset="562364">In doing so, weâ€™re not unmindful of the harshness of a procedures which allows withdrawal and the tax exempt status without a prior adjudication of a correctness of a proposed withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.939" offset="624536">In this and similar cases, such an action by the Service may result in irreparable laws to an organization largely dependent upon contribution from donors.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.516" offset="678766">But we are constrained by the explicit language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.268" offset="701858">Relieved, if being appropriate, must come from the conveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.701" offset="719517">Mr. Justice Blackmun concurs end results; Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the decision of this case.</text>
