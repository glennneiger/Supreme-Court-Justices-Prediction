            <label>Mr. Douglas D. Doane</label>
            <text syncTime="45.451" offset="258508">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.233" offset="273659">Colorado is here today to ask the Court to assist Colorado to remove the Federal Courts from the administration of the Welfare Programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.078" offset="321097">The facts of this case are that the respondent, Mrs. Vialpando was working and receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children and she was provided certain work expenses under the Social Security Act which required that the state agency in determining need for Aid to Families with Dependent Children must take into consideration, expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.152" offset="513358">The statutory language is not specific as to how this is to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.625" offset="531226">In Colorado, prior to July of 1970, it had a policy which provided for consideration of employment expenses by the itemization of each and every expense which the -- which the welfare recipient have and under this system, Mrs. Vialpando was able to reduce her income by a certain amount of employment expenses and under the previous system she was able to deduct approximately $181.00 of her income and her income was about $281.00 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.866" offset="692245">So this made her eligible and made her needy under Colorado’s program.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.024" offset="712829">After July of 1970, however, Colorado changed its policy and provided for taking into the consideration employment expenses, expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of income by allowing deduction of mandatory deductions from income.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.890" offset="808333">Also, a $30.00 flat allowance which was statistically based and the way Colorado arrived at this $30.00 figure was to take for a period of months during 1969 and 1970, all of the actual employment expenses of all the recipients for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and strike an average and in our brief in the appendix, it’s indicated these figures range from about $32.00 to $36.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.334" offset="946051">Colorado therefore and its policy said, “We will strike an average allowance for employment expenses at $30.00.”</text>

            <text syncTime="227.597" offset="987115">I am having trouble understanding that as matter of arithmetic as they ranged from $32.00 to $36.00, why is the average is $30.00?</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas D. Doane</label>
            <text syncTime="235.856" offset="1020134">Well, the state of Colorado felt that it was taking into consideration expenses attributable to the earning of income by basing it upon what the employment expenses were and not using the actual figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.002" offset="1088784">In both of the lower Court decisions, they do not pass upon whether the $30.00 is an actual sufficient amount or whether it is statistically correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.035" offset="1144895">What they say in the lower courts is that the state may not use --</text>

            <text syncTime="276.719" offset="1183660">I was just wondering why an average of -- a low of $32.00 and I have $36.00 turns out to be $30.00 in Colorado because where went to school it doesn’t?</text>

            <text syncTime="294.266" offset="1253773">In other words, they based it upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.797" offset="1263909">The statute does not in our opinion say that you have to allow what the actual average was.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.571" offset="1287001">It’s I think similar to a case the Court had previously in Rosado versus Wyman were the Court found that you could use statistically based averages as long as they were fairly priced and that some people would have an advantage by the use of that average, other peoples would -- other people would be disadvantaged.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.350" offset="1950198">The Federal Statute in this case provides that the states in determining need must take into consideration expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.994" offset="2016758">Reasonably attributable would seem to require that someone has to decide how you determine what expenses are reasonably attributable.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.876" offset="2052284">The federal regulations in this case are both in the federal register and in the form of Handbook material and circulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.128" offset="2089273">This type of regulation both of which we feel are binding upon the state, mainly restate what the statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.275" offset="2129816">There is some statement in the federal regulations that certain items maybe standardized, but prior to the time Colorado implemented this standard flat expense allowance, the federal regulations both -- the federal regu -- federal register regulations and the circulars allowed for the use of a standard expense allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.583" offset="2247053">And Mrs. Vialpando alleges that Colorado can only accommodate this requirement of the statute by itemizing all expenses and there’s no other way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.941" offset="2292506">As I mentioned previously in Rosado, the Court did allow the use of standard -- standardizing and averaging as long as the items in the average were fairly priced.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.860" offset="2344229">The Court has also held in the welfare areas and recently in the Dablino case that the federal law is to be looked at carefully and if there is not a specific statutory requirement or if there is not a condition of eligibility being added by the state that the states do have discretion in this difficult area in the -- the Courts are -- the lower courts have been cautioned by this Court to not get into the are of -- determine what might be in its opinion the best way to -- to administer the welfare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.943" offset="2492500">Colorado’s position is that this -- this AFDC statute is merely setting out of the basic state plan requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.045" offset="2528967">It doesn’t spell out of every detail, period and comma to have a program which complies with the statute, that there are other requirements in the statute that have to be accommodated also.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.975" offset="2580689">One is that the states must in a prompt manner determine eligibility and provide benefits to those who are eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.483" offset="2618723">The determination of employment expenses only on an item by item basis would have to be done every month for every welfare recipient not only to determine eligibility, but to determine the amount of assistance and the cost of administering this type of a determination would take a lot of money from the actual benefits going to the welfare recipient and use it up for administrative expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.643" offset="4499331">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.580" offset="4515109">In this case we’re concerned with a particular section of Social Security Act of 1935, in particular Section 402 (a) (7) and it's the respondent’s position that the question presented in this case is whether consistent with this Section 402 (a) (7), the State of Colorado may refuse to take into consideration expenses of employment which are reasonably attributable to the earning of that employment, but in excess of the flat, $30.00 per month allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.347" offset="4658155">The controlling statute, Your Honors, require states which participate in the AFDC program to disregard any expense reasonably attributable to their earning of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.461" offset="4710609">The Colorado regulation permits the disregard of $30.00 per month in addition to child care expenses and mandatory payroll deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.960" offset="4772571">We believe it is also important to state what this case is not about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.787" offset="4803918">The respondent is not arguing that Colorado must allow unreasonable work expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.634" offset="4839236">In fact, it is our position that the states have a duty to inquire into the reasonableness of work expenses both as to amount and as to whether or not they're necessary for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.594" offset="4899109">There cannot be a tenuous relationship between the particular work expense in the particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.489" offset="4930664">The State of Colorado made that inquiry prior to July 1, 1970 and determined that in this ascension be upon those case that she had reasonable work expenses in the amount of $126.11 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.317" offset="5006002">That has never been an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.897" offset="5020317">But however, after July of 1970, the State of Colorado disregarded the flat, $30.00 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.222" offset="5061590">And because the State of Colorado failed to take into consideration $96.11 per month, Mrs. Vialpando finding it difficult to meet in -- make ends meet left the job market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.437" offset="5118537">So therefore, the question before the Court is whether Section 402 (a) (7) permits states to use flat amounts based on statistical averages to determine work expenses when the individual’s work expenses exceed that flat amount and we think that properly this analysis begins first by looking to the text of the statute and trying to determine its plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.086" offset="5245074">And that statute says, “That a state plan must, except as maybe otherwise provided in Clause 8, provide that the state agency shall in determining need take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative as well as any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of that income.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.299" offset="5353953">First of all, the word “shall” is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.477" offset="5362625">It mandates the state agency to look at both income and expenses of the recipient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.180" offset="5693440">But as far as administrative efficiency is concerned, we would agree that the use of the flat amount for all recipients based on a fair average, together with the right of individual recipients to demonstrate an entitlement of greater reasonable work expenses would both meet the goals of administrative efficiency and stay within the terms of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.963" offset="5936588">I don’t believe the State of Colorado could use the figure $10.00 per month because as Mr. Justice Stewart mentioned, three years ago, in the State of Colorado, average work expenses were close to $37.00 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.220" offset="6001580">We would maintain and -- expenses have gone up since that time so we wouldn’t want to accept the use of the $10.00 per month.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.481" offset="6146717">Your Honor, I think the State of Colorado by its participation in the AFDC program has to follow these -- this statute, (a) (7) and that statute requires both the recipient to demonstrate an entitlement to each and every expense and also the State of Colorado to disregard each and every expense as long as its reasonably attributable with their earning of income, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.200" offset="6249535">The words of the statute taken into consideration perhaps in and of themselves are flexible as the Tenth Circuit indicated, but when you look at this particular statute and its entirety, it takes no a particular meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.620" offset="6311184">First of all, take into consideration modifies the words “any other income and resources.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.908" offset="6332395">The word “any” is used to introduce income and resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.428" offset="6354442">The State of Colorado and the Secretary of HEW certainly don’t put forth any averaging argument or outside sources of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.118" offset="6393208">The State wants to take into consideration every cent of outside income and they properly should.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.893" offset="6428317">ADC is to be given to needy children and naturally the state should take into consideration any outside source of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.523" offset="6470844">You can’t average child support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.136" offset="6485264">You certainly can’t average the earnings of all employed recipients in the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.781" offset="6503863">You’ve got to take a look at each individual’s outside income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.107" offset="6525179">Now, this statute goes on and adds a expense section and it's introduced by the words “as well as.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.605" offset="6555167">We think its reasonable to conclude that Congress intended work expenses to be treated in the same manner and that’s why they used this phrase “as well as.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.576" offset="6607099">And this language requires any expenses to be disregarded, not sum, not an average but any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.576" offset="6647014">Section 402, the Social Security Act in sub-section (a) (8), Your Honors, uses the word “other than any” when talking about the state’s option to set aside earned income for the future needs of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.442" offset="6750563">In the -- in that part of the statute, Congress has said that states may permit any or excuse me, all or any portion of the earned income to be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.508" offset="6802808">I think this demonstrates that Congress knows how to use specific language and allows states to disregard something less than a 100% and that part of the statute they use the words “any, all or any portion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.487" offset="6870727">In our Section of the statute, they used the word “any”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.890" offset="6904268">In addition to the plain meaning of the statute which we think supports the respondent’s position, we also think that the legislative history supports us as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.880" offset="6964245">Prior to 1962 when this part of the statute was added, it was optional for states to disregard work expenses, but the Senate Finance Committee in reporting out the Bill which amended 402 (a) (7) stated that it believed that only reasonable for the states to take these expenses fully into account.</text>

            <text syncTime="2631.833" offset="10604042">I’d like to comment on several aspects that have either been brought by the Court or by Mr. Armour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.999" offset="10636748">Now, I might start with this situation that existed in July of 1970 when Colorado chose to change its method of taking into consideration work expenses as Mr. Armour has suggested prior to July the method involved in itemized treatment of work expenses for each individual recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.634" offset="10735282">The state’s position is that Mrs. Vialpando did not have a vested right to that earlier regulation or to that method and that the state as long as they acted consistently with the Social Security Act and of the requirements of HEW could elect a more efficient or less costly method to take work expenses into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.568" offset="10835069">And I would also like to bring out that we have all at the counsel side of the case dwelled upon the $30.00 aspect of the work expenses allowance, but it should be noted that the work incentive purpose of the Social Security Act was accomplished not only by the $30.00 work expense allowance, but by the provision of the Colorado Rules that permitted the deduction of mandatory payroll deductions such as State taxes and Social Security and also the actual cost of child care was deducted from income in determining need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.275" offset="10993894">So this work incentive in Colorado after July of 1970 consistent of this three-part work expense --</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.974" offset="11428676">This is another aspect that concerned us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.523" offset="11438811">This was an individual decision in an individual case in El Paso County, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.415" offset="11462426">The same facts could’ve been presented to an (Inaudible) technician in another part of Colorado who would have made a decision on a rather subjective basis equally valid saying that the car was a personal expense, that a job was available closer to the home of the recipient or that she could use probably transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.967" offset="11552601">This is another reason why Colorado prefers to use a flat amount so that there were will be a more accurate and a more consistent determination in each case then is possible without some type of numerical guideline on what is a reasonable work expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.820" offset="11648000">I also like to point out that in connection with the statistical tables that appear in our appendix, this may have been adequately brought up, but I would like to specifically point out that each of the pages, 41A and there after consists of a printout of all of the Aid to Dependent -- Aid to Families or Dependent Children cases in Colorado for the particular month and Mr. Freedman in his analysis on pages 40 to 41 of the appendix, took the items from the left hand column of each of these computer printouts and pulled out the general work expenses, the transportation expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.532" offset="11870877">He excluded childcare because that was going to be allowed separately, took out union dues, tools, telephone and computed a 100% average.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.964" offset="11916643">The people who had more than $30.00 prior to July of 1970 are included in each of these printouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.321" offset="11946005">It’s a 100% sample of the high as well as the low work expense allowance cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.625" offset="11975262">So, this is a primary part of our position that a flat amount does take into consideration not only any type of expense, but also considers the specific amounts that were being spent in Colorado by this class of recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.476" offset="12082678">Then I’d like to comment briefly on your question Mr. Chief Justice on the -- whether or not it would be permissible for Colorado to have a $30.00 work expense allowance and then if a particular recipient wanted to present evidence of expenses in excess of $30.00 --</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.379" offset="12222276">What the state’s position is in this case is that once the dollar amount is fixed by a reasonably statistical basis it could if it wanted to pay in excess of that average figure, but it doesn’t have to, that it’s permissible under the Social Security Act to stick with the flat amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.197" offset="12305554">And I think as Mr. Armour responded, the position of HEW and I think the state’s response would be that if the flat amount is too low, this would present a problem that we would then take up in the District Court.</text>
