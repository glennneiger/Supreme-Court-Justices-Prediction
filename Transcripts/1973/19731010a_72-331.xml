            <label>Ms. Brenda Soloff</label>
            <text syncTime="49.535" offset="274913">Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.108" offset="293198">At issue in this case is the ability of the State, in this case New York and its subdivisions here, Eerie County.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.366" offset="330188">To provide themselves with some reliable assurance that in committing public funds to independent contractors, the contractors will deal with them openly and candidly, when information is sought about those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.033" offset="396852">Two related sets of New York statutes were struck down by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.638" offset="423288">The first, in which New York General Municipal Law Section 103 a is an example, requires each public contract to contain a provision that if a person who is called before a grand jury, or other agency, which is authorized to subpoena and swear witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.990" offset="508656">Such a person is called to testify in an investigation concerning a public contract and he refuses to sign a waiver of immunity against subsequent criminal prosecution, or to answer any relevant question concerning that contract or transaction, then that person and any business organization of which he is a member or officer shall be disqualified from public contracting for five years, and existing contracts maybe canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.446" offset="630491">That’s the first set of statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.841" offset="644075">The second group statutes struck down below and which New York General Municipal Law Section 103 b is an example, is directed at already completed contracts and transactions and establishes a five-year disqualification from future contracting for a similar refusal to cooperate under similar circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.064" offset="736967">Both of these statutes and related statutes, which are similar in other sections of New York Law, were struck down by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.933" offset="780434">The two appellees in this case, are licensed architects and members of a partnership which according to the complaint had various contracts with Eerie County.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.374" offset="834247">The only one of these contracts which is specifically mentioned in the complaint, concerns the construction of a domed stadium in Eerie County, similar to the Astrodome in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.243" offset="889731">In answering the complaint in the District Court, the Eerie County attorney admitted the existence of various contracts and of the stadium contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.326" offset="926093">This is the only information in the record about contracts between appellees and any publications in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.644" offset="955350">On February 8, 1971, while under public contract, the two appellees and another member of the partnership were subpoenaed to testify before an Eerie County grand jury respecting transactions and contracts that they had with the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.882" offset="1020238">All three were presented with waivers of immunity which they were asked to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.896" offset="1036330">All three refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.599" offset="1043122">The third member of the partnership then was granted immunity and testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.536" offset="1062870">The other two did not, and did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.622" offset="1079275">The appropriate authorities were informed of the refusals and the instant action followed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, claiming that they had in the past and wished in the future to contract with the State and its agencies, the appellees claimed that the statutes violated their privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.936" offset="1160464">A Three-judge District Court, and what must be regarded as an over extension of the decisions of this Court and Gardner v. Broderick and its companion cases agreed, and the statutes were enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.896" offset="1228382">However, in seeking to protect the public interest, the State has not acted unreasonably towards its contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.932" offset="1264431">The State and the businessman enter not only into a business arrangement, but into something of a social contract as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.660" offset="1299435">The State begins with a premise, that public money must be well and carefully spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.491" offset="1322736">Neither cost nor quality must be painted by graft, bribery, the use of inferior materials, or any other unseen impermissible factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.113" offset="1457215">This is different from the Gardner case in a number of respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.888" offset="1468291">A contractor, when he enters into a contract, understands at the beginning what is expected of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.701" offset="1511549">He hasn’t committed his life, his career, his ability to earn a living through this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.900" offset="1540389">He’s seeking profit from an episodic source.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.103" offset="1573198">He knows at the time that he enters it, enters the contract that this kind of information will be required of him.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.587" offset="1647073">It does not appear in the case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.175" offset="1653447">Section 1123 of the City Charter is undoubtedly a harder thing to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.842" offset="1676121">That’s one thing that can be said about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.123" offset="1689287">Beyond that, contractors typically enter contracts with attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.509" offset="1722828">They have typically knowledge, they have the advice of the counsel at the time they enter contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.376" offset="1750204">And the contract itself is for a limited span of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.061" offset="1772983">A policeman doesn’t consider perhaps every possible ramification of his employment at the time he takes that Civil Service Examination, doesn’t have the advice of counsel, typically.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.255" offset="1825750">And the Section 1123 was very different from the statutes that we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.710" offset="1847589">The statutes in this case request to information concerning any transaction or contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.115" offset="1873189">Section 1123 of the City Charter talks about any kind of activity in city Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.610" offset="1899207">It’s much broader than the scope of the duties of the policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.946" offset="1912581">It involves local elections; it involves any aspect of city Government which might possibly occur to an investigating agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.731" offset="1963677">But in each case, the basic situation is that the contractor in a one case and the employee in the other case, when called before grand jury, must waive his immunity, correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="494.375" offset="2054269">I think that there’s a much closer question as to whether the public employee makes such an agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.136" offset="2349244">But that the -- the consequences of what happens to a contractor have to be considered from the point of view or at the point in time of what he bargained for.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.000" offset="2408699">What was it that he bargained for at the time he went into the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="586.638" offset="2423327">What was his understanding?</text>
            <text syncTime="589.474" offset="2434612">I think one thing that’s perfectly clear is that the interests of the State are both urgent and vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.858" offset="2472229">In the public contractor and in a public employee situation, it is also clear that a contractor has a higher obligation than the ordinary citizen to provide information with respect at least to the relationship which he has with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.348" offset="2546103">If he’s unwilling to provide the information, then the relationship should not continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.883" offset="2576300">So, that the businessman understands when he goes after a contract on which he’s seeking to make a substantial amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.360" offset="2614230">But before that money, and even perhaps public safety will be committed to him, he must be willing to accept certain preventive measures and to cooperate in any necessary detection of wrong doing doing because typically in a situation involving contracts, detection of wrong doing will be difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.265" offset="2697822">So then he enters into the special relationship with the State and he agrees that not withstanding any possible consequences, should the time come, he will be open and honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.590" offset="2739096">Even if it means that the evidence will be used against him and that he will be brought to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.482" offset="2758635">Obviously, a principal benefit of this understanding is prevention.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.675" offset="2779429">Corruption may well be nipped in the bud.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.353" offset="2794162">The public not only is protected, but it has some sense of confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.569" offset="2810984">The contractors can be called to account.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.609" offset="2823210">But the execution of contract is an open book and that the public is not being had.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.923" offset="8600451">In fact, if anything, I think in the Gardner case, the statute in the proceeding which was involved was more restrictive and more related to the specific employment of the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.451" offset="8658547">Now, that Section 1123 stated at that time if any counsel man or other officer or employee the city shall after lawful notice in presses, willfully refuse to appear before any Court or judge or any legislative committee or body authorized to conduct such hearing or inquiry or having appeared shall refuse to testify or answer any questions regarding the property, government, or affairs of the city or of any county included within its territorial limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.929" offset="8788428">So that in Gardner, the law was even more restrictive and more limited than it is under Section 103 a b, sections of the general municipal law, Sections 26.</text>

            <text syncTime="2190.790" offset="8839941">Well, I was speaking of that one paragraph in the Gardner case in which the Court said that, if the appellant, the policeman and refused to answer questions specifically directed and narrowly related to the performance of his official duties without being required to waive immunity in advance then the privilege against self incrimination would not have been a bar to his dismissal but that still in fact is the law and not just a view of collateral question, it would mean that the policeman is penalized for exercising constitutional right, isn’t he?</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.453" offset="9586521">However, the Court of Appeals held it by virtue of the constitution of the State of New York, a perspective the defendant or one who was a target of an investigation might not be called or examined before a grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.852" offset="9684114">So, at the time that this proceeding arose, the targets, the architects, the police here were presented with a waiver, directed him to give up all constitutional rights which is ahead of the time and compelling them, tempting the appellant to testify against themselves obviously in a criminal proceeding.</text>
