            <label>Mr. Donald S. Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="9.627" offset="115252">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.494" offset="126746">I hardly got a chance to say anything yesterday except good afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.572" offset="150988">I would briefly like to reiterate the facts as set forth by the Government because I think they're important in this case especially in light of Robinson which Mr. Justice Rehnquist just gave his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.140" offset="213264">The important things in this case are that Mr. Matlock was arrested in the yard outside of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.881" offset="244297">He was placed in the police car.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.710" offset="255582">The officers all admitted that they were in no danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.446" offset="274495">The house was under siege.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.137" offset="281287">It was surrounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.217" offset="289646">They had no knowledge that any fruits of any crime were in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.805" offset="312007">No questions were asked as the defendant’s relationship as an owner, as a tenant, as a husband, or anything else in relation to the Marshall residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.536" offset="366864">The officers, even though they had Mr. Matlock completely under control in the car, never asked his permission to search the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.196" offset="413571">When they did go to the door, of course they did not have that very important thing and that is a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.749" offset="439693">They never asked Gail Graff who she was.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.352" offset="458188">The officer’s testimony is clear that when they came in the door she was standing with her two- or three-year-old baby.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.096" offset="489117">They never asked who she was, whether she was a daughter, a wife, or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.381" offset="510224">They asked whether or not they could search the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.208" offset="521613">She consented to the search of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.988" offset="532689">I think it is important that we remember in this case that it's Mr. Matlock’s constitutional rights that are at stake here and not Gail Graff’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.416" offset="574380">The Government argues that there was a joint occupancy of that bedroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.496" offset="686707">They're made in Pardeeville, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.344" offset="694126">That's their claim to fame, that and fishing, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.349" offset="710113">It's in Columbia County and this search was conducted by the Columbia County Sheriff’s Department along with, at the second and third search, the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.833" offset="752118">And even in the second and third searches, which aren't material to this case, the FBI did not bother to get a search warrant either.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.491" offset="782733">I take it there's nothing in the record about the local police knowing Gail or Mr. Matlock or anything.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald S. Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="185.603" offset="819200">One of the deputies, I believe his name was Cross, later testified and he wasn't there during the first search.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.287" offset="849920">He testified that he knew that Gail Graff was a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.636" offset="875311">And he testified that even though he didn't know the relationship of Bill Matlock to Gail Graff, that at one time when he was visiting the house he saw Bill Matlock come down from the upstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.796" offset="939886">But that testimony isn't important, I don't believe, because he wasn't one of the officers who were involved in the first search wherein they found the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.734" offset="979696">Now, getting back to this joint occupancy, the government has used that term quite often and I don't believe it is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.324" offset="1014073">Gail Graff was asked whether or not they could search the bedroom and she said, “Yes, you may, you can search the whole house.”</text>
            <text syncTime="243.333" offset="1050122">And, I believe the testimony is that, from time to time, she slept in that bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.566" offset="1071020">But as far as joint occupancy goes, there is nothing in the record to show that they jointly occupied the bedroom as husband and wife or on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.290" offset="1113861">As a matter of fact, there is evidence in the record that Gail Graff did have a bedroom of her own on the first floor of that residence.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="275.743" offset="1179690">You do not think that permits any inference of joint occupancy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_s_eisenberg" startTime="279.099" stopTime="391.918">
            <label>Mr. Donald S. Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="279.099" offset="1193169">No, I don't because that, Your Honor, is something that came out again after the first search and after the money was found in the closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.169" offset="1229427">Now had they inquired or had they told, and that is an issue that is not in this case also, had they told Gail Graff “You don't have to consent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="296.036" offset="1260878">Or had they asked her, “Are you the wife?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.374" offset="1270282">Do you have joint occupancy of the bedroom?”</text>
            <text syncTime="300.512" offset="1278746">Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.061" offset="1280940">But they never asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.649" offset="1287314">And finally, it was subsequent to, I believe, all of the searches that she or -- I guess it was in the second or third search which aren't material where she said, “Yes, the upper two drawers are mine and the bottom two drawers are Bill’s.”</text>
            <text syncTime="315.875" offset="1340291">Now in that regard, Your Honor, I think the inference could just as well be that there wasn't room in the house to store all clothes and people were using everybody’s closets.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.878" offset="1380310">I think that the testimony was very clear in this case that at no time did anybody asked, for instance, whose dresses were hanging up in the closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.945" offset="1420539">They could've been Mrs. Marshall’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.967" offset="1428584">That is not in the record that they were Gail Graff’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.025" offset="1444885">The District Court Judge Doyle found that the Government had not proved by the greater weight of the credible evidence that there was joint occupancy of that bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.564" offset="1490965">They of course, also found that there was no evidence except this “reliable hearsay” that there was any evidence that Gail Graff was married to Bill Matlock or that she had authority to consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.318" offset="1546031">What the Government would ask this Court to do at this time is to say that apparent authority is sufficient and you don't need actual authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.537" offset="1586887">Now, another thing that I believe is important in the case is the Government has argued before this Court yesterday that Gail Graff said that, “It's my room.”</text>
            <text syncTime="388.996" offset="1632758">Now, she never said that and that is not in the record.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald S. Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="410.524" offset="1718857">The question of exclusivity never came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.181" offset="1729515">I believe, on my examination of Mr. Matlock or of Mrs. Marshall, we asked the questions of, “How was he there?</text>
            <text syncTime="423.699" offset="1771520">What was he doing?” and she said “He is a paying tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.065" offset="1781029">He'd paid a $100.00 a month and he was current.”</text>
            <text syncTime="428.578" offset="1791060">And the judge, Judge Doyle, made a finding that he was current in his rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.640" offset="1807360">No question was ever asked and I don't think it was inadvertent or on purpose, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.229" offset="1829616">No question was ever asked whether or not Gail Graff also was a paying guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.943" offset="1848529">But the police officers never asked either.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.829" offset="1860023">It was myself who asked on direct examination of Mrs. Marshall what the situation was as far as rent goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.327" offset="1894087">The officers never inquired at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.297" offset="1913940">Now I agree with the law, of course I agree with it, that two persons who have equal rights may give legal consent and that's very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.962" offset="1960647">But here, Your Honor, and that was my next point, that there was no inquiry as to whether or not Gail Graff was standing in the position of the defendant’s wife, whether of nor she also was paying for that apart -- for that bedroom, or whether or not she was sleeping any place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.743" offset="2027729">Mr. Justice Marshall yesterday, raised the question of the joint use of the diaper bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.258" offset="2049776">And there again, that's a question that was never raised yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.672" offset="2063464">There is no doubt about it that a diaper bag in this situation, the very strong inference is that it was used for diapers for Gail Graff’s two or three-year-old son.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.226" offset="2105678">That question was never going into the suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.368" offset="2118217">The main question in this case and the only real question is whether or not a third party who consents is in fact, or “in appearance, a joint possessor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="523.446" offset="2170567">The Seventh Circuit placed upon the police the burden of determining whether a person encountered at the door has the authority to consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.206" offset="2213616">Now we cited numerous cases, and the Government has also.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.877" offset="2228245">They rely, for instance, on the Gorg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.976" offset="2244650">Now, the differentiation in that case is that, in Gorg, the police acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.764" offset="2271817">They had consent and they had the request of the homeowner to search the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.457" offset="2302537">The only question in that case was the right of the person who occupied the room, the son in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.047" offset="2332944">If you remember, marijuana plants were found in the room after the son was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.468" offset="2350602">The question of the right to refuse consent was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.037" offset="2372859">The Court or the Government also cites Schneckloth.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.446" offset="2390518">The only question in Schneckloth was the voluntariness of the consent to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.337" offset="2414132">They cite Hopper and in that case, the Court never reached the question of actual authority because it ruled that the consenter did not even have apparent authority to consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.406" offset="2462407">Now, yesterday, the question was asked, Mr. Wallace of whether or not he relied upon Hill and I would say today, “Yes, he does rely upon Hill” and he also, I would assume, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that he now would rely upon Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.873" offset="2532206">Robinson is analogist to Hill in one thing and it's differentiated from Matlock in that, in Hill, the search was incidental to an arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.496" offset="3690684">The -- they have cited in their brief and we cite in ours, Black’s Law Dictionary which says, in effect, that greater weight of the credible evidence, preponderance of the evidence are really the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.069" offset="3745019">The Government cited, which I am thankful for, the Wisconsin jury instructions which Judge Doyle followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.541" offset="3774903">And in the legislative comment or in the comment attached to the Wisconsin jury instructions, the court noted or the drafters of those instructions noted, “greater weight is exact synonym for fair preponderance.”</text>

            <text syncTime="957.466" offset="3906664">But I am assuming, Your Honors, and I think it’s apparent from the record in this case that what they really meant was “greater weight” and not “great weight.”</text>
            <text syncTime="966.550" offset="3942922">It does show that they read the Government’s brief very thoroughly because that’s where the mistake was first apparent in their own brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.881" offset="5164304">On page 12 (a) of the appendix to the petition of the District Court’s findings on which this was based and those findings right in the middle of the page include very specifically that she told the officers that the east bedroom was occupied by the defendant and by her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.720" offset="5255628">I’m on page 12 (a) of the appendix to the petition for certiorari, Your Honor, where we have the District Court’s opinion reprinted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.917" offset="5296379">Right in the middle of the page, the findings on which the District Court based its holding that there was apparent authority includes the statement right in the middle of page 12 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.271" offset="5341832">She told the officers that the east bedroom was occupied by the defendant and by her.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.255" offset="5373806">She then consented to a search of the east bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.656" offset="5391360">She told the officers that she used the top two drawers of the dresser in the east bedroom and the defendant used the bottom two drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.933" offset="5424483">This was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.412" offset="5430439">These findings were upheld by the Court of Appeals on page 3 (a) of the same appendix at the end of the paragraph that ends at the top of the page 3 (a), that she then told the officers that she and defendant both occupied the east bedroom and that the woman’s clothing therein contained were hers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.804" offset="5527928">And, that she told the officers that she used the two upper drawers of the dresser in the room and the defendant used the two lower drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.621" offset="5567216">Without burdening the court to read, all the excerpts in the record which support that I can cite in the printed appendix to page 13, page 15, page 16, and page 18 which is testimony by each of the three officers that conducted the search, all supporting that she said that this was her bedroom, that she slept in the same bed with the defendant there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.698" offset="5687589">Now, there’s just one other factor in response to the question Mr. Justice Blackmun has been asking about whether any of the officers who conducted the search knew who she was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.342" offset="5738162">The only indication in the record on that does not relate to her specifically but to Mr. Matlock, the respondent himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.239" offset="5781734">And, that appears at a portion of the transcript that was not reprinted in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.113" offset="5805244">On page 78 of the transcript in the course of the interrogation of Officer Cross who was one of the officers who conducted this search, they asked him, “Did you know whether or not he lived in that house?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.778" offset="5871909">And he said, “Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.685" offset="5879536">“How did you know that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.457" offset="5886537">“Well, I had seen him there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.818" offset="5896046">My father knew the Marshall family and through that, I knew he was staying there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.570" offset="5919033">That is all that appears in the record on that subject.</text>
