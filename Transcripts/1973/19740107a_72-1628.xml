            <text syncTime="124.232" offset="573649">And fortnightly against United Artists, this Court held that a CATV system which receives a broadcast and makes the broadcast signals available to subscribers -- members of the public does not perform the work which was broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.400" offset="650344">Two issues are presented by these petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.077" offset="665078">First, the main petition, the so-called distant signal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.893" offset="684304">Does the location of the CATV’s receiving antenna on which the broadcasts were received more than a few miles from the CATV community and the connection from the antenna to the community by a microwave link licensed by the FCC have copyright significance?</text>
            <text syncTime="173.606" offset="771135">Trial court held it did not -- Court of Appeals concluded that the antenna location and the connection to the antenna have copyright significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.867" offset="816170">Second, the conditional cross-petition raises the issue whether the reception of a broadcast by a CATV system is converted into a performance of the broadcast work not by what the CATV system did with reference to the broadcast copyrighted work but by reason of what the CATV system did on separate channels not used to receive broadcasts and not involving CBS’s copyrights.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.032" offset="1064856">I turn first to the leading question of the distant signal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.370" offset="1086276">Fortnightly as the Court will recall involve two CATV systems in West Virginia, one in Clarksburg, one in Fairmont which received Pittsburg and other stations 60 to 80 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.160" offset="1141342">In Fortnightly the issue was whether the reception of -- by the two CATV systems was a performance and hence an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.765" offset="1187840">In holding that this -- that the reception service by those two CATV systems was not a performance, this Court did not discuss the receiving antenna or its location in relationship to the CATV communities which had granted a franchise to the Fortnightly CATV’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.411" offset="1258371">There were actually five towns that had granted franchises to the Clarksburg CATV and two to the Fairmont CATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.506" offset="1290762">Nor did the Court discuss the devices which connected the antenna to the CATV distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.057" offset="1320960">There was in Fortnightly a issue as to the technology of the equipment, cables, amplifiers and other equipment to bring the signal from the antenna to the subscriber sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.175" offset="1369443">United Artists, the copyright owner there argued that -- and CBS repeats the argument here, that the CATV systems have complicated equipment, sophisticated equipment and that they are active rather than passive and that the transmission and retransmission of the broadcast signals by the CATV systems, in the course of distributing the signals to the subscribers constitutes a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.967" offset="1480620">There was also in Fortnightly issues to whether the CATV systems spoiled the market for the copyright owners by making a broadcast available in the CATV community outside the broadcast stations market.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.807" offset="1536000">The trial court found that the broadcast could not be received by the residents of Clarksburg and Fairmont on their own antennas.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.923" offset="1568392">The CATV reception, the copyright owner argued, spoiled his market.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.055" offset="1588976">The Fortnightly Court of Appeals said that the copyright owner was entitled to prevent delusion of his market and to limit his license to areas and to audiences.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.048" offset="1636937">This Court rejected arguments based on the technology of equipment and by the Court of Appeals -- and the arguments by the CAT -- of the copyright owner that his market had been spoiled.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.802" offset="1687928">It focused on the meaning of the word performance and held that reception of a broadcast intended for public reception and the distribution of the broadcast signals to the -- what this Court called additional viewers was not a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.199" offset="1761593">Despite this background, the Court of Appeals in this case concluded that the location of the antenna on which the broadcast was received and the technology of the equipment to connect the antenna to the cable distribution system had copyright significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.252" offset="1829721">The error, we submit in the decision of the court below stems from the fact that the court based its reasoning here as it did in Fortnightly on what the copyright owner said was his preferred method of economics in exploiting his copyright rather than on the meaning of the word performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.450" offset="1914567">CBS and the copyright amici in the court below argued that the television station has a specific market area bounded by the points for the broadcast to receive off the air by rooftop antennas.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.036" offset="1984888">A copyrighted owner, it is said, does not intend his broadcast to be viewed outside that area and it was viewed outside that area by reason of the CATV reception is -- it is as CBS says as an importation of a distant signal which is according to CBS, a broadcast function.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="496.827" offset="2064091">No matter how its broadcasted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_c_barnard" startTime="498.174" stopTime="1099.996">
            <label>Mr. Robert C. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="498.174" offset="2069420">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.511" offset="2074749">All of this is an echo of the copyright owners’ economic argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.230" offset="2097633">Building on this copyright owners’ preferred economics, the court below concluded that the CATV perception would be permitted only if the broadcast signal was in the Court’s words, “In the community.”</text>
            <text syncTime="519.275" offset="2153848">But the signal was not already in the community, than it was a distant signal and importing it into the CATV community made the CATV functionally equivalent to a broadcaster and the Court deemed that to be an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.967" offset="2224588">The Court recognized the difficult task of defining the term distant signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.552" offset="2246949">It could not use rooftop antennas as the CBS had suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.781" offset="2267847">Such a conclusion, the Court said, “It would fly in the face of the mandate of Fortnightly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="553.355" offset="2290207">It could not require that the receiving antenna be located in the CATV community.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.372" offset="2314240">The CATV receiving antennas in Fortnightly were located outside, all seven of the CATV communities although the exact distance did not figure in any way in the decision in Fortnightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.501" offset="2366798">In the end, the court below devised the definition based on antenna technology using such vague litigation prone words as near or adjacent to.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.195" offset="2417580">When the antenna is not near or adjacent to the CATV community and what the court called, transmittal or re-transmittal devices were needed to bring the signal form the antenna to the CATV community, then it is a distant signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.466" offset="2478602">Unless the CATV can bear what it called the heavy burden of showing that the signal could be received near or adjacent to the CATV community on an antenna of equivalence sophistication, another litigation prone test.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.280" offset="2553835">The transmittal or re-transmittal device that the court talked about in its formulation included either microwave or cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.305" offset="2589989">In the courts below, CBS argued that because microwave is transmission through the air, its use makes CATV like a broadcaster who also transmits through the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.935" offset="2640457">But both courts below held that microwave is point to point transmission equivalent to or a substitute for cable or wire.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.506" offset="2686746">And that issue of microwave is not in the petition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.316" offset="2702002">Nonetheless, the court below made the use of the transmittal device, such as microwave or cable critical overlooking the fact that a transmittal device was in fact used in Fortnightly cables and amplifier to bring the signal from the antenna to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.013" offset="2780787">In support for this new judicial formulation, the court below and CBS here placed central reliance on two sentences in this courts opinion, United States v. Southwestern Cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.739" offset="2851736">That case involved the FCC’s rule under the Communications Act requiring that CATV systems in the Grade B contour of a station received the station and block out other signals, so-called non-duplication of the same program.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.012" offset="2936790">And upholding the FCC’s regulatory authority, this Court described CATV systems as having one or both of two functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.857" offset="2980153">First, enhancing reception of local stations and second, transmitting to subscribers the signals of stations beyond the reach of local antennae which this Court referred as the importation of distant signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.876" offset="3044206">This was said in a regulatory context, not copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.507" offset="3062805">And this Court specifically noted that the term “distant signal” was given a specialized definition by the FCC in the context of the compulsory carriage rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.928" offset="3108467">Distance meant, received beyond the Grade B contour of a station aligned, calculated on an engineering assumption along which good reception is expected 90% of the time at 50% of the locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.458" offset="3174609">It does not mark the limits of actual reception.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.050" offset="3192999">The court below recognized that this FCC definition of distant signals for regulatory purposes was in its words “unsuitable for copyright purposes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="790.485" offset="3238661">Five of the ten stations received in -- by the Fortnightly CATV’s were distant under the FCC rule beyond the B contour.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.590" offset="3279099">This is significant because Fortnightly and Southwestern were argued together and decided at virtually the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.332" offset="3314103">If the FCC definition of distant signals had copyright significance, this Court would surely had said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.485" offset="3346704">Instead, it held that the reception of signals, both distant and non-distant under the FCC definition was not a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.088" offset="3393097">While the court below uses the word distant signal, the rule that constructed is not based on distance nor in the FCC definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.256" offset="3441789">In fact, it conflicts directly with the FCC definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.409" offset="3466344">The Durango Station received by the CATV in Farmington which the court below held was distant, is only in fact 45 miles from Farmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.835" offset="3548056">In Fortnightly, the Pittsburg stations were 80 miles from the Clarksburg CATV systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.015" offset="3572820">A mountain blocks the reception of the Durango Station in Farmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.482" offset="3594658">The CATV receiving antenna is on the side, on a maser, 40 miles away and the signal is brought to Farmington by a microwave link licensed by the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.186" offset="3653486">But Farmington is within the Grade B contour of the Durango Station and hence, it is local under the FCC compulsory carriage rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.768" offset="3699775">The station demanded and received compulsory carriage and non-duplication protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.693" offset="3727569">Under the new definition of the court below, the reception of the Durango Station by the Farmington CATV which is required by the FCC has become a performance, the consequence which CBS dryly describes as anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.971" offset="3808653">The court below said without analysis that in receiving distant signals, as it defined them, the CATV was functionally equivalent to a broadcaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.781" offset="3855882">But it made no attempt to compare the functions of a CATV system and a broadcaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.553" offset="3886916">Whether or not the signal is distant under the rule of the court below, the CATV had nothing to do with procuring or originating the program, the broadcaster did.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.631" offset="3931324">The CATV system merely received what was broadcast and made the signals available instantaneously and without editing to its subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.072" offset="3969045">This is exactly what the CATV did in Fortnightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.657" offset="3987331">CBS argues that the CATV selects stations to be received for their programming and hence selects programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.708" offset="4099553">Moreover the court overlooked the fact that in law and in the economics of the television industry, the CATV subscribers are in the audience coverage area of the television station.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.329" offset="4182100">It has done this by its general rules permitting CATV reception of stations including the so-called distant signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.835" offset="4224104">But in this instance, the FCC has acted more specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.193" offset="4241554">It has granted microwave licenses to receive these specific stations, by these specific CATV’s to distribute the signals in this CATV community.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.870" offset="4836206">And the significant thing Your Honor is that the distant station here that CBS talks most about, Los Angeles to Farmington is -- has the Farmington CATV subscribers included in its coverage area in the -- and it's published in the volumes, as they are published to shows -- what the coverage area is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.188" offset="4933486">And the record has got a number of proposals by the stations citing in CATV coverage including that of a Los Angeles station which talks about its CATV coverage in the New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.075" offset="4997016">When CBS decided to use television to exploit its works, it took the medium the way it is, in fact and in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.711" offset="5043618">When CBS authorized the broadcast, it was broadcast under the words of the statute intended to be received by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.548" offset="5070890">The statute says, “The public,” not just the part of the public, CBS would like for its own private reasons to be allowed to receive the broadcast, and in the industry economics, the subscribers were in the stations coverage area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.098" offset="5129091">I now turn to the issue raised by the cross-petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.739" offset="5151660">Whether the activity of CATV system on separate not used for broadcast perception so tainted the reception of the broadcast as to convert that reception into a performance put in another way as there are doctrine of infringement by analogy or in the words of the court below, is there a spillover effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.671" offset="5239432">When a CATV originates the program and makes it available to subscribers, it performs the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.460" offset="5258553">If copyrights were involved, Teleprompter secured a license and paid a royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.035" offset="5288856">No CBS program was involved in any CATV origination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.459" offset="5306619">This is not pay TV, no extra or separate charge was made for the originated program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.119" offset="5329189">The origination by the CATV was on separate non-broadcast channels and in no way interfered with or interrupted the reception of the broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.693" offset="5371507">There were two kinds of programming, the so-called automated programming in which cameras, scans, clock and weather instruments and the sort of general interest programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.170" offset="5413407">The idea of originating programming occurred in the early 60’s because there was an empty channel not used for broadcast reception in the Farmington system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.363" offset="5450188">And they’ve conceived the notion of originating with the idea of attracting people to use the CATV service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.965" offset="5480594">It worked and in the relevant periods in this case, three of the five system had general interest programming and automated programming, Farmington, Great Falls and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.135" offset="5537332">The amount varied, Great Falls had two hours a day, five days a week, and up to in New York, 1971, 10 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.499" offset="5574740">Now the interconnection that Justice Stewart mentioned is actually a form of origination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.674" offset="5595429">It was closed circuit rights to the (Inaudible) the systems got in 1964 and 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.515" offset="5626776">Three other systems here carried those fights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.071" offset="5640986">No extra charge was made for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.847" offset="5656137">But with reference to -- I should say that all of this CATV origination was in conformity with the FCC rules and there was one sale of commercials that occurred in 1971 in New York, the New York CATV, that also was in conformity with the FCC rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.875" offset="5756238">CBS has proposed a doctrine of totality by which a reception service can be converted from a non-performance into a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.657" offset="5803363">Because the broadcaster originates programs, sells, commercials, is interconnected in networks, the CATV, it is said which performs these functions is equivalent to a broadcaster and its entire reception service thereby becomes a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.424" offset="5870446">But the CATV systems performed none other broadcaster functions that CBS talks about with reference to the broadcast works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.161" offset="5913391">CBS also speaks about receiving distant signals by broadcasting stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.324" offset="5938051">But here also, the analogy is based on a confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.702" offset="5955605">A distant signal in this context means that a broadcasting station got its program from a distant source, i.e. a network.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.917" offset="5992385">But the broadcaster remained responsible as the originator of the program and he performed it when he broadcast it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.073" offset="6025091">Moreover, there's no totality here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.704" offset="6035540">Two other systems, Rawlins and Elmira had only these automated programming devices, time and weather scan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.732" offset="6067722">New York did not receive distant signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.920" offset="6080470">Its franchise required it to receive only local New York stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.693" offset="6099487">Only one system sold commercials on originations in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.949" offset="6124565">Two events of interconnection that are talked about occurred in 1964 and 1965, months away or years away from the dates of the alleged infringements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.947" offset="6168555">The courts below we submit were correct in holding that there is no spillover effect and that there is no doctrine of totality by analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.436" offset="6210456">In conclusion, the FCC’s regulatory plan perhaps for CATV was designed among other things to provide television service to households in small communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.864" offset="6264163">That is like the service otherwise only residents in large metropolitan areas are able to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.226" offset="6297704">More than 2 million households now depend on CATV reception of distant signals for part of their television service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.752" offset="8063791">Now, Mr. Barnard says that we’re making a frontal assault on the Fortnightly decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.390" offset="8086256">I think that we are entitled to recover here and there should be an infringement whether the Fortnightly decision stands, whether it falls, whether it’s limited to its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.908" offset="8132336">Of course, if you read Fortnightly, Fortnightly says that you have to look at the functions, what place does cable television play in the total spectrum of the broadcasting industry and it used such words as viewers, passive beneficiaries on the viewers side of the line as contrast with broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.161" offset="8229407">Now, I can’t imagine a television viewer or a passive beneficiary who imports distant signals or originates programming or who sells commercials or interconnects into a network.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.599" offset="8283115">No, I know who performs that kind of a function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.946" offset="8292519">Broadcasting stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.884" offset="8300251">WCBS TV in New York City imports a local signal from a network broadcasting center and it originates programming, it sells commercials and it’s a broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.675" offset="8347481">So does the Teleprompter Cable Station in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.002" offset="8360751">It receives those local signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.067" offset="8369006">It originates programming and its selling commercials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.850" offset="8388127">Now, when the case was here, the Fortnightly case was here, Mr. Barnard didn’t talk to this Court about importation of distant signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.956" offset="8424594">He said repeatedly in that oral argument, ”It were in the area where reception is possible off the air.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.186" offset="8457509">We’re in the area where reception would've been expected if it were not for the ruggedness of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.663" offset="8479451">There was no talk about business signals, he said that those areas were in the service area of the broadcast stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.867" offset="8516232">Now, what's involved in the importation of distant signals taking that function?</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.684" offset="8535458">The fact of the matter is that the Court of Appeals didn’t invent the term, the earth is round and television signals on the earth travel in straight lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.719" offset="8575582">As a result, as an engineering matter, television signals normally don’t travel more than 60 to 100 miles, although there are a few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.960" offset="8612571">There was uncontradicted evidence in the record on that subject. Furthermore, the FCC is always regarded as a policy to have separate markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.663" offset="8655412">They don’t want super stations in New York City retransmitting to different areas and therefore Los Angeles is a separate market and its not Farmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.696" offset="8707553">Now, how did Teleprompter Farmington get the Los Angeles Stations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.434" offset="8734511">Well, what it did was to procure and select the type of programming what it -- that it wanted Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.432" offset="8758439">That’s what you said in Fortnightly, was a characteristic of a broadcaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.340" offset="8778083">There were some 113 other television stations as close to or closer to Farmington than Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.215" offset="8813610">But they wanted those Los Angeles Stations because of the type of programming that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.086" offset="8833045">I’m sure they had sports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.831" offset="8840046">I’m sure they had situation comities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.218" offset="8849659">I’m sure they had lots of things to get those signals into Farmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.422" offset="8870452">There was no way of getting those signals into Farmington other than by this importation and Teleprompter got a 1,000 mile microwave transmission link in order to bring it in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.052" offset="8932937">And the Los Angeles Stations did not intend that their programs go to Farmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.273" offset="8957806">And that copyright owners who testified at this trial said that they -- when they licensed those independent stations at Los Angeles, they did not intend the programs to go to Farmington because they were looking to sell those programs again until they license them again for syndication in the Farmington area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.417" offset="9030426">That’s the subject on which Mr. Graubard will talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.959" offset="9044532">This Los Angeles supermarket or the used car salesman who was sponsoring the program on the Los Angeles Station had no interest in Farmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.632" offset="9087269">There's been an amicus brief submitted there by MPAA which has some very interesting statistics on the subject that Mr. Justice White asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.219" offset="9125616">The statistics show that only 30% of the advertising on national television, is national advertising, 70% of it is local advertising, spot advertising, those kind of advertisers have no interest in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.140" offset="9197296">Mr. Barnard closed with the question of how the court below defined distant signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.441" offset="9222478">Well, the court started out by defining local signals, a local signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.053" offset="9232927">A local signal, it said was something that could be received in the local community with a CATV antenna for example, which you had to get a clearer and good reception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.710" offset="9283605">If you went 600 miles or 800 miles further, if you had to locate your antenna near the broadcasting station miles and miles away and you had to use microwave to bring it in there, then the Court said the signal is presumptively distant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.799" offset="9359987">It's costly to lay miles of cable and to go through this microwave apparatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.719" offset="9383602">If Teleprompter didn’t have to go 600 miles to Los Angeles, it would never have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.121" offset="9409202">So the Supreme Court -- excuse me, the Court of Appeals said that with respect for example to the Los Angeles stations which went 600 miles to Farmington, they were presumptively distant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.751" offset="9459775">No one would quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.563" offset="9466984">The Salt Lake City stations with 400 odd miles away from Great Falls, no way that those signals could have gotten in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.507" offset="9498749">Noway that they could be called anything but distant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.116" offset="9513169">The Denver stations were something like a 160 miles from New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.710" offset="9531559">No question about the fact that they were distant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.474" offset="9546606">So that the dispute as to what the court really did here below, I think is rather meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.165" offset="9577430">Mr. Barnard has referred to the fact that the FCC has recently refined its description instead of now talking just in terms of Grade A and Grade B contours, they now use the term, “significant viewing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.053" offset="9636989">If you applied the significant viewing test, the current FCC test to the signals that were involved in our case or with the exception of Durango that the Court of Appeals found imported and distant signals would be distant signals under current FCC definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.317" offset="9722044">Mr. Barnard disagrees with our arguing totality of services but I don’t I don’t understand how we can talk about anything but totality if were talking about function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.726" offset="9771677">Teleprompter advertises that it imports distant signals, then it attracts an audience and the audience listens till the Teleprompter originations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.867" offset="9824235">And that new audience is attracted to the originations, turns on the commercials and listens to the commercials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.157" offset="9853388">Now, what difference does it make that its on a different channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.314" offset="9870002">The Court of Appeals said maybe there would be a different result if you’re on a different channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.047" offset="9888914">Well, up in New York City where I am, that Teleprompter channel has four or five channels on which its originating, programming or having public access programming or showing time and whether or its running an A&amp;P report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.826" offset="9952026">Every time you turn on to that other channel, you are not watching WCBS TV, it’s not enhancing the reception of the signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.662" offset="9983373">It’s blocking it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.172" offset="9989433">Now, that might be desirable because the FCC encourages this type of activity but it blocks out our signal just as much as if they had run those originations on our channel two in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.554" offset="10047007">Now, its true that if Teleprompter weren’t there, channel two is competing with channel four and channel five and channel seven and the viewer has the same option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.531" offset="10082847">But every one of those competitors is paying copyright royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.908" offset="10100402">The only competitor that’s not paying copyright royalty is Teleprompter and make no mistake about it, teleprompter has said repeatedly in its public statements that it was a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.914" offset="10148362">The Fortnightly system was no competitor or a broadcaster at most, it enhanced the reception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.545" offset="10174903">But the Teleprompter prospectuses which we have placed into evidence here state that they are competitive with broadcasters for programming, for personnel, for sponsors and for content.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.854" offset="10236134">Therefore I think that each of these separate functions, one feeds on the other, I think that the Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.677" offset="11879445">Mr. Sokolow has explained the meaning of the term syndication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.079" offset="11909016">Generally speaking, once the initial performance is over, the program owner licenses individual television stations to perform the work or the program and these television stations obtain their own advertising revenues for the programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.506" offset="12010789">As some members of this court may have noticed, some of these reruns seem to go on forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.531" offset="12046838">And there is a different scale of compensation for the artists depending upon how many reruns there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.410" offset="12086439">Now obviously, a program has a greater potential audience and a greater sales value through licensing, if it has not previously been shown in the local area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.743" offset="12151745">Many network broadcasts that are initially licensed are limited to certain regions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.349" offset="12182152">No broadcasts through broadcasting stations reach the entire nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.808" offset="12216007">By importing distant signals, the CATV systems enter the market for these programs that are to be shown initially in the areas not previously fortunate enough to have had the benefit of the initial performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.346" offset="12306181">Thus the cable performance in this distant area is frequently and exclusive first run for which the copyright owners received nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.113" offset="12361247">Moreover, the copyright owner must then deal in these areas for licensed fees based on second showings rather than on initial performances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.205" offset="12413597">To the extent that the copyright owners receive a smaller amount for a second run, the creative artists similarly suffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.968" offset="12460617">On the other hand, to the extent that the cable systems would pay a reasonable royalty for a license to perform programs received distant signal, the copyright owners and the artists would benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.568" offset="12526968">We believe that this is a clear case for the enforcement of the copyright law whose purpose and design were to reward the creators of programs for the performance of their works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.192" offset="12589558">It follows that the copyright owners and their associated creative artists also support the contention that cable systems that function as broadcasters are actually performing the copyrighted works and should pay royalties for the use they make of these works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.095" offset="12685166">Now we are not as concerned frankly at this time about classifying as broadcasters, those cable stations that have innovated programs that have interconnection that go advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.884" offset="12772310">We independents and artists know that cable television today is still growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.489" offset="12814733">By the end of the decade, it is predicted that approximately one-half, the families of the United States with television sets will be linked to cable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3644.829" offset="14656052">Its got a fairly complicated set of rules that have among other things compulsory licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.574" offset="14679040">They have provisions for payments, they have a whole set of standards as to which CATV systems would -- as would apply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.436" offset="14718537">I say to the Court these in very general terms because I am not involved in the legislative fight and I know it only incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.213" offset="14753646">But I would suggest to the Court that what Mr. Graubard has said and what CBS has also intimated as well as one of the other amici that the Court should decide against CATV to motivate the situations so that there's legislation hardly places the proper emphasis on the issue in front of this Court, the issue in front of this Court is not to motivate legislations to decide what is the meaning of the word performance and a statute which is in front of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.239" offset="14885721">May I comment on one or two of the points that Mr. Sokolow made in the course of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.087" offset="14909127">He talked about how much origination CATV does and compared the origination by the New York CATV with WCBS in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.694" offset="14951549">In fact, WCBS New York under the rules originates everything it broadcasts, whether it gets it from the network or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.212" offset="14977567">It is the responsible broadcaster and a responsible originator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.527" offset="14998883">Mr. Sokolow said that we transmit this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.733" offset="15011631">We are engaged in transmission and retransmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.572" offset="15026991">We are in engaged in handling electromagnetic energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.739" offset="15039739">We do not handle the sight or sounds of the programs in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.032" offset="15052904">We received a signal, we deliver the signal to our subscribers homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3752.146" offset="15085296">Otherwise there is no sight or sound involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.710" offset="15099611">Mr. Sokolow talked about whether we were active or passive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.530" offset="15114867">This Court in Fortnightly said that the CATV systems were active.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.142" offset="15133362">They were active on the side of the viewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.000" offset="15148722">He said that in Fortnightly, it was intended that this programs be viewed by the broadcast by the Pittsburg stations, be viewed in Clarksburg and Fairmont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.265" offset="15193757">The Court of Appeals here said, “They recognized that the programs would not have been viewed in Clarksburg and Fairmont but for the CATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.529" offset="15230851">And the Clarksburg -- in the Fortnightly, the copyright owner made exactly the same argument as made here that his market in Clarksburg where there was a television station was being disturbed by the reception of the CATV programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.956" offset="15300545">In Fortnightly, we urged that the CATV subscribers were in the coverage area of the stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.148" offset="15333355">I think that our subscribers now are in the coverage area of the stations.</text>
