            <text syncTime="13.181" offset="129463">In this case, the National Labor Relations Board orders Golden State Bottling Company to reinstate with backpay an employee Golden State had discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.310" offset="185992">Pending Judicial review of the Board order, Golden State sold its business to All American Beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.949" offset="228519">There upon the Board conducted a supplemental proceeding and upon finding that All American after its purchase continued the business without interruption or substantial change in operations, held that All American having acquired the business with knowledge of the outstanding court order was also subject to an order directing the reinstatement of the discharged employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.260" offset="365819">And therefore the Board entered in order to that affect and also an order that both firms were jointly and severely liable to pay the employee the backpay due.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.725" offset="423602">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the Board and enforced its order and we in turn agree with the Court of Appeals and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
