            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="41.261" offset="241789">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.207" offset="257567">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.350" offset="274181">The basic question is, whether it is permissible for the National Labor Relations Board in the exercise of its broad discretion to establish the standards and safeguards for conducting a fair and free representation election to conclude that a union's offer to waive initiation fees for all employees who signed union authorization cards before the election, should the union win the election, does not tend to interfere with the employee free choice in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.758" offset="435827">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.641" offset="443350">In September of 1970, pursuant to a representation petition filed by the Mechanics Educational Society of America, the Board conducted a secret ballot election among the production and maintenance employees of the Savair Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.090" offset="521091">The Union won the election by a vote of 22 to 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.113" offset="541153">The company filed objections to the election alleging among other things that union representatives had improperly coerced certain employees by leading them to believe that if they failed or refused to sign a card requesting an election and the Union were successful, they would be fined from to $20.00 to $200.00 before they could join the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.195" offset="657554">These objections were investigated and set down for hearing before a Hearing Officer of the Board who found that prior to the filing of the representation petition, Bennie McKnight, an employee supporter of the union, solicited employees to sign cards applying for membership in the union, which cards were to be used to support the petition as this Court note out those that generally, the Board requires a support of 30% in cards before it will process a representation petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.858" offset="824216">McKnight told the employees that if they did not sign a card now, they would be subject to an assessment or a fine if the Union won the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.284" offset="869878">When the employees questioned McKnight about the union's policy, he told them to call Alfred Smith, the Union Secretary-Treasurer whose phone number he gave them.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.886" offset="920242">After the election petition was filed but before the election was held, Smith addressed the group of about 20 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.376" offset="966217">In response to a question about the assessment, he explained that it was the union's policy to waive initiation fees in organizing new shops but to require a small fee to be paid by the persons joining the union after a contract had been negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.383" offset="1066318">In fact, the union's constitution and by-laws provide for the local union to set the initiation fees, which in no event can exceed $10.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.872" offset="1120235">Smith added that there was no assessment or fine in our organization in regards to the situation of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.948" offset="1156493">The only time the fine was imposed was for violation of the union's constitution or by-laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.157" offset="1193378">The Hearing Officer concluded that what the Union did through Smith and McKnight was to inform employees that an initiation fee would be waived in the eventuality of a successful election by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.157" offset="1261401">He further found that whatever confusion may have re-existed with respect to the terminology utilized by McKnight, the union's policy was clarified at this initial organizational meeting at which Smith explained the union's policy when he held a subsequent meeting shortly before the election going over the same ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.230" offset="1381669">At the first meeting, there were about 20 employees and he indicated that about the same number were at the second meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.844" offset="1412075">The first meeting was attended by the card signers.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.359" offset="1434227">He explained that those were the only names and addresses that he had and that's what the notice went out to.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.106" offset="1465156">There is no indication as to who in addition may have been present at the second meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.979" offset="1504653">Following the Board's decision in DIT-MCO that a waiver of initiation fees prior to an election, is not an improper inducement for vote for the Union regardless of whether it was contingent upon the results of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.652" offset="1583334">The Hearing Officer concluded that the union's waiver offer did not impair free choice in the election and recommended that the union be certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.271" offset="1633802">I should point out that DIT-MCO represents a reversal of the Board's earlier position in Lobue in which the Board had concluded that if the waiver was tied to the outcome of the election, it was improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.949" offset="2796565">Isn't that what the case is about whether this is an improper inducement?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="685.774" offset="2819866">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.965" offset="2824568">I think that that is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.959" offset="2832614">I think that there's no question that it is an inducement to sign a union card.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.978" offset="2856647">The question is whether it's a type of inducement, which is likely to influence the employees' vote in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.881" offset="2892278">For example, there's no question that if the Union promises to get the employees a wage increase if it wins the election, that may well be an inducement for the employees to vote for the Union in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.183" offset="2965525">But that type of inducement the Board and the Courts have held is not the kind that would preclude a rational choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.276" offset="3009829">Now, in this area of what inducement is going to fall on which side of the line, I submit that that can often be a fine question.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.075" offset="3097078">The Board felt that it fell in the coercive side not with respect to the waiver of the initiation fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.466" offset="3134589">The Board almost from the beginning has taken the position that an offer to waive initiation fees during an organizational campaign was a legitimate type of inducement and did not interfere with the employee free choice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="791.768" offset="3243781">In Lobue, the thing that the Board felt it made it improper was that, in addition to offering to waiving the card of the Union furnished was a membership card, and at the bottom of it, it said, "The employee shall be entitled to put a paid-up initiation fee upon if the Union wins the election" with the addition of "if the union wins the election" that the Board felt tipped the scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.958" offset="3436565">Now, on reconsideration in DIT-MCO which was applied here, it was the Board's judgment that whether you exquisitely stated that the waiver would be effective if the union wins the election or you didn't as so state, didn't make any realistic difference because that fact would be understood in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.850" offset="3612108">Because the way that the thing operates, as I explained before is that the only time that the Union is in a position to force an employee to pay an initiation fee is if it wins the election, it gets a contract and the contract has a Union Security Clause in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.960" offset="3704581">So, in effect, what the Board concluded in DIT-MCO was that it was really relying upon an artificial factor in making the propriety of the waiver turn upon whether or not the Union said nothing or whether they were candid enough to add that the waiver is effective only if we win the election.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.762" offset="4071758">But the waiver serves the legitimate function as the Second Circuit pointed out in the (Inaudible) case which was solely a current case, I might point out, there was no election there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.592" offset="6607099">McKnight, the fellow who was alleged to have done the coercing was not put on the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.964" offset="6640640">And that the Hearing Officer at the end of the evidence reproduced in the appendix, have stated, as I read his testimony on page 79 and 80 that he has filed an input to McKnight on and he said, "I'm not going to take the testimony of Mr. Smith" which is clear as I say, Smith was offensive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.561" offset="6866965">The test is whether or not the circumstances are such that you can objectively include whether it's reasonable to believe that there was coercion or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.392" offset="6922344">And the more I submit that the circumstances here warrant that influence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.881" offset="7016281">The Hearing Officer follow on that Bridgeman's testimony was no probative value at all because of his propensity to confuse fine assessment and initiation fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.466" offset="7102589">And therefore based upon his testimony as a whole, he found no basis for believing that there had been a threat or a fine either before or after the election petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.471" offset="7174583">With respect to Rice, the Hearing Officer found and credited his statement and McKnight had mentioned the word "fine" prior to the filing of the petition but then he went on and define that Smith's explanations at the organizational meetings which were held shortly thereafter completely clarified the Union's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.867" offset="7336229">I just wanted to say that with regard to the failure to conduct an adequate investigation, the Court of Appeals examined that contention and found no merit to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.223" offset="7641652">In Gilmore, they said the card was immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.091" offset="7661087">Others they talked about what was said by the union representative as to the outcome of the election and the effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1907.222" offset="7705600">It's very clear for the record at the time that the Hearing Officer had testimonies on one page there that this was an authorization card and it actually was an application to join the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.003" offset="7856797">And it said something to the effect that "I authorize the MESA to act as my representative to bargain with" and there was a blank space and they fill in the company name and "That I hereto abide by and make application to join the Union."</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.638" offset="7915311">And in the testimony of Mr. Smith, he made it very clear because I cross-examined him on this to whether this man could join the Union before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.179" offset="7953450">Because they were getting these cards signed up and we're not talking about pre-petition for the petition was filed for the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.527" offset="7982811">These were cards that were signed after the petition and an election have been scheduled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.857" offset="8008202">I asked him if he had a card signed if he could join, this man could join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.910" offset="8024398">He made it very clear that there was merely an application until such time as they have a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.044" offset="8044878">They could not belong to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.988" offset="8052715">And once there they could not belong with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.270" offset="8061806">He said, the only ones that he allowed to belong with the Union were they withdraw a card from a shop where they have had a contract or at the representatives of the union who were members, who were dues paying but they were actually business agents in that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.063" offset="8116976">But the card itself was merely an application to join the union and it was this authorization card.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.670" offset="8155429">Well, I assume as soon as they would negotiate a contract, then at that point, they would then say that all these people who signed cards don't pay any initiation fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.425" offset="8190433">They become members and of course, they close shop and they'll say that you have the check up system in the shop for the other employees to withhold of their initiation fee and their dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.586" offset="8231079">And those who have signed the card will get a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.217" offset="8241633">Of course, I am not in disagreement in the Respondent with the right of the Board of course to have a blanket waiver of initiation fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.822" offset="8288026">They don't themselves in a fear with the choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.560" offset="8302968">The Union was to waive for all, it's equal to all, and all participates the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.097" offset="8325120">I agree with the Board's position in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.068" offset="8333061">However, in this particular case, this was where they obtained the card on economic inducement and based it on the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.889" offset="8364304">For those people that signed the card and I'd say that's a moral commitment that that person is asked to make based on an economic inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.103" offset="8401189">In other words, he has him sign the application, the union representative and say now, "Okay, you made a commitment to have these union representatives."</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.072" offset="8437029">The side of this card is definitely, I think, material to the union's position of wanting this commitment because it leaves the employee absolutely no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.294" offset="8485930">He cannot afford not to sign the card because if he doesn't sign the card and the Union is elected then he is penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.765" offset="8527830">Secondly, if he doesn't show an interest for the Union when he is asked to sign a card, then he may feel or after the union later when they get in and say, "This man didn't have the interest."</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.989" offset="8572656">And there's a great deal of pressure put on these fellows between the time that the election was scheduled and that final date when that election was held to sign those cards because several of them signed it right at the last day just as a hedge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.380" offset="9362286">Under the facts and circumstances of the cases in which they reversed themselves, I'm inclined to think it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.338" offset="9386109">It could because they do say in effect that one is a card and doesn't affect the card once that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.155" offset="9413381">I think you have to take a general principle and tie the two together to the case to understand which way they're going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.105" offset="9441176">I don't think that Lobue and DIT-MCO have completely reversed each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.353" offset="9458207">I don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.407" offset="9462387">I think that if you study the facts of each case, they're different enough that I think the Board in dictum they said in effect they are reversing it themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.234" offset="9509721">But I don't think they were really doing it for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.109" offset="9521215">I think it was based on the facts of the two separate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.493" offset="9534694">But I think you're in a position -- this Court is in a position where it have to determine if they're going to set a full principle of what can be done or what cannot be done by the Union in regard to an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.734" offset="9591641">They have to set down whether the Board is acting arbitrarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.344" offset="9606165">They have to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.182" offset="9613479">And I see that there is as certain commitment that means something would having to sign that card that the NLRB wants to ignore that and say, "Well, a man can sign a card and yet he can vote against the union and the signing of the card means nothing."</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.364" offset="9690175">I think the fact that he is coerced into signing that card is some kind of a moral principle or he may not want to abide by but he has to, to protect himself and it may be against his own brain or against his integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.182" offset="9745450">And I see that's not giving him a free choice and the full freedom in the right of having an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.236" offset="9769691">Secondly, there's a good question as to whether or not the obtaining of this card isn't a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, is an unfair labor practice in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.521" offset="9818802">Under Section 158 of the National Labor Relations Act provides there, "The expressing of any views, arguments or opinions, or the dissemination thereof whether in written, printed, or graphic or visual form, shall not constitute of the evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this subchapter, if such expressions contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of a benefit."</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.256" offset="9929770">Well, he is asked to sign something here and he certainly is either under the threat of reprisal in my set of facts because he was told the threatening of the fine, or he was given some kind of a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.818" offset="9976059">And if it's an unfair labor practice then it certainly doesn't give the man the freedom of choice and I think for that reason that there's another reason that this is an arbitrary decision on the Board in coming to the conclusion that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.943" offset="10052545">Now, there's a second issue in my case that's a secondary issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.788" offset="10075951">However, it's one that I'm very concerned with because I was involved in it and I think the Regional Director has a certain obligation to investigate and make sure that this election is held and that this election is held under the conditions that there is freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.530" offset="10154841">We filed objections to the election for objections and at the hearing, there was no evidence produced as to objections number three as to certain promises were given to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.469" offset="10206668">There was a letter received by the District Director of the NLRB from an employee in which he said that he alleged a certain conduct that have been set forth was not necessarily be grounds for setting the election sides, as the buying of this or the union's promises of what it would accomplish if it were to be selected as the bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.162" offset="10317427">They replied to that letter and said in effect that there is -- Mr. Ridley was not a party of the proceedings and his objections were not timely filed, and that what was in there appeared to be extraneous to the objections filed to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.145" offset="10417319">Well, I think that there are two things that they violated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.899" offset="10432366">One, I don't think they can hide it behind the technical requirement that the party be the Company or the Union to file objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.824" offset="10467997">I think that once they have had a letter like that, that alludes directly to the objections that they should bring that person in or at least allow him or tell him or notify him that he can appear at that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.152" offset="10513345">I think there's a second obligation, on their part, to notify the Company or the Union of this objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.591" offset="10539154">And that they -- of this employees -- so they can investigate it at that point to determine whether in fact, there was some conduct that went on that should be investigated to make sure that there was a fair and an impartial election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.592" offset="10599131">And since there was no investigation, they did not allow this man to appear in effect by not telling that he had a chance to appear that they cannot certify this Union as the bargainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.269" offset="10657855">I thank you very much.</text>
