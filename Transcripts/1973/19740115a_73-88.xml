            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments next in 73-88, United States against Edwards and Livesay.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward R. Korman</label>
            <text syncTime="58.965" offset="312633">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.970" offset="324650">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.495" offset="346697">That court refers judgments of conviction entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio convicting Eugene H. Edwards and the late William T. Livesay who died subsequent to the granting of the writ of attempting to break into the United States Post Office in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 2115.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.159" offset="437394">The Court of Appeals held that certain scientific evidence which established that paint chips which were found on the clothing of both of these gentlemen came from the same source as paint chips on the window of the post office where the attempted burglary had taken place, and that this evidence was the fruit of the unlawful taking of the clothing of these two gentlemen some 10 hours after their arrest on the morning following their arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.755" offset="547736">Although the Court of Appeals held that the arrest of Mr. Edwards was lawful, did not in fact reach the issue as to Mr. Livesay and that there was probable cause to take the clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.792" offset="595905">It held that the taking was fatally defective because a warrant had not been obtained for the search and seizure of the clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.732" offset="635716">The issue presented here as to whether the authority to search an individual without a warrant or an independent showing of probable cause which arises by virtue of his lawful arrest is somehow dissipated, if it is not exercised “substantially contemporaneously with the arrest,” but several hours, in this case approximately nine, after the administrative process and other mechanics of the arrest have come to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.911" offset="752431">Since there is in this case a lingering issue as to the validity of the underlying arrest raised by implication in the brief that’s been filed by the respondent and expressly by Mr. Edwards in a separate document which he has filed with this Court entitled the motion for extension of time for filing a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.393" offset="830276">It is appropriate, I think to begin the discussion of the facts in this case where it all began on the evening of May 31st in the year 1971, in the City --</text>

            <text syncTime="198.208" offset="869564">Would you first tell him Mr. Korman how that issue is still alive?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward R. Korman</label>
            <text syncTime="202.579" offset="887014">Well presumably, it has been raised as an alternative grounds for affirmance, although it was not raised as an issue on our petition for certiorari that was raised, as I understand it in the opposing papers on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.303" offset="949917">But nevertheless, I think it would still be helpful to start this case where it began in Lebanon, Ohio around 10:45 in the evening on May 31, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.527" offset="1002893">At this point, I would refer the Court to a map which is on page 1 of a supplemental appendix which we filed yesterday and which might be helpful at the Court had while I discuss the facts, in the event that it had not yet been distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.767" offset="1079798">I gave nine copies to the clerk right now and you might be able to distribute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.630" offset="1115220">I said yesterday, we filed a supplemental appendix which contained a map of the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.171" offset="1141447">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.035" offset="1156911">The map is the map of approximately two or three square blocks and around 10:45 in the evening at 10th Plymouth pulled up at South Sycamore Street which is a block from the Lebanon Post Office and parked at number 124 South Sycamore Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.073" offset="1225038">Three gentlemen emerged, took something out of the trunk of the vehicle and began walking towards the business district.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.500" offset="1254713">This scene was viewed by several people who were sitting on the porch or looking out of their windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.085" offset="1277074">One of them called the police and told them that three strange persons had been seen emerging from this stand, Plymouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.825" offset="1304033">This is generally a business district except for this brief, small residential area and a bulletin went out that three suspicious persons had been observed leaving this town on an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.443" offset="1362547">At that point and time, Patrolman Ashley was cruising on South Street which is right around the corner towards the bottom of the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.299" offset="1393894">He proceeded to examine the Plymouth, saw nothing particularly unusual about it except that it had an out-of-county license plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.295" offset="1429943">He then drove around --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="339.498" offset="1434749">Did you say out-of-town license plate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_r_korman" startTime="341.027" stopTime="622.740">
            <label>Mr. Edward R. Korman</label>
            <text syncTime="341.027" offset="1440810">Out-of-county license plates, apparently in Ohio, each county, -- the residents of each county get license plates with a particular letter on the license number to indicate the county in which the automobile is registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.061" offset="1500996">Seeing nothing particularly unusual other than this, Patrolman Ashley drove his car around up South Sycamore Street North, he made then a right turn onto West Main Street, and then you see the alley on West Main Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.447" offset="1558570">He drove down the alley, into the driveway of the Lebanon Post Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.042" offset="1584901">He then drove through the driveway and now to South Broadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.311" offset="1602038">As he got to the past the Post Office he turned north and he saw two individuals on the north boundary of the Lebanon Post Office near the museum.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.353" offset="1646132">It appeared to him that they were walking in a north, northeasterly direction that they had just come from that portion of the Post Office and being perhaps naturally suspicious since this was 10:30 at night in the business district, which was not on a Sunday night, which was not to his knowledge terribly crowded with people.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.387" offset="1734322">He decided to follow them and so as they walked, he drove behind them, and they made a turn on West Main Street to begin walking towards South Sycamore.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.939" offset="1776536">And by the time, Agent Ashley had gone to West Main Street over the radio of his car he heard that the burglar alarm had been sounded at the Post Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.719" offset="1819585">He there upon stopped these two gentlemen, asked them to get into his car which they did without drawing the revolver and then he drove back to the Post Office, got out of the car, by that time other police officers had arrived on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.120" offset="1885205">He examined the bank and the area right where he had seen these gentlemen emerged from and discovered that in fact there had been an attempted burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.650" offset="1919373">There were burglar’s tools, the screen had apparently been tampered with and also he noticed paint chips near the area as well, and it was at that point that he told these gentlemen that they were under arrest and they were taken into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.720" offset="1995651">Now these two gentlemen were Mr. Edwards, who was a respondent here and one Huntley, who was not convicted of this crime because he jumped bail and ultimately plead guilty to bail jumping rather than the particular offense here.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.715" offset="2047582">At the time all of this was transpiring, the Defendant Livesay was observed back on 118 Sycamore Street hopping over the back fence and hiding in the bushes at 118 South Sycamore Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.445" offset="2114560">He had been observed by a Mr. Cruise who lived in the house and who had earlier was one of the neighbors who had observed this three gentlemen emerged from the Plymouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.770" offset="2155833">He then saw Mr. Livesay run towards the Plymouth and hide in the Plymouth where Mr. Livesay was ultimately discovered by another patrolman who placed him under arrest and brought him to the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.791" offset="2207869">After these gentlemen were placed in custody, this is now and taken into the station house, this is approximately now about 11:30 on a Sunday night.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.881" offset="2248307">They were placed in custody and the following morning, the police having noticed the paint chips near the window with police -- went to a local department store called Kaufman’s Department Store and purchased new clothing for these gentlemen, went to the prison sometime around 9:30 of the local jail, asked the two men to change into the clothing, which had been purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.104" offset="2349140">The clothing that they were wearing had been taken from them and that of course the scientific analysis which followed clearly established that the paint chips that were found on their clothing came from the same source as the paint chips from the window of the Post Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.062" offset="2421029">And prior the trial, a motion to suppress was made and I note only for the purposes of information amounting to suppress only dealt with the probable cause aspect and did not involve the issue that was ultimately raised and decided in the Court of Appeals and decided by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.583" offset="2507128">At trial the evidence was as I described it, the observations of the patrolmen, the neighbors in the surrounding area, and of course the testimony of two scientific -- two people who made the scientific analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.590" offset="2695105">And as I understand what you said it’s in that attachment primarily that the claim was made at the arrest was invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.794" offset="2719974">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.680" offset="2727497">Now the Court of Appeals in a rather exhaustive opinion rejected the argument that there was no probable cause for the arrest held that the police officers acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.365" offset="2766158">It’s a reasonable proof and then should have under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.895" offset="2780369">However, it held that the seizure of the clothing, some ten hours after the arrest was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.806" offset="2803984">The Court reasoned that since the arrest was not contemporaneous -- the search was not contemporaneous with the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.146" offset="2833345">It could not be justified as a “search incident to an arrest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="693.282" offset="2849855">And struck down the taking of the clothing because there was no warrant even though as I indicated earlier found probable cause to justify the actual taking of the pants independent of the probable cause for the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.631" offset="2915265">We have filed a petition for certiorari not only because of the conflict among the circuits but the importance of the issue in both federal and state prosecutions and indeed we have been advised by the Attorney General of Ohio that a predictable spate of habeas corpus litigation has already begun that in the Southern District of Ohio alone, two habeas corpus petitions have already been granted in the Dean versus Gray and Carpenter versus Gray and are pending before the Sixth Circuit and there is yet another petition for habeas corpus in a case called Huskinson versus Grey raising the same issue as involved in this case and the Sixth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.551" offset="3214942">Whereupon they said was, “Well, what did you do in this case?” and he said that they took it the morning after apparently with the expressed purpose in mind not of holding it for inventory or exchanging it for a jail clothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.506" offset="9222792">What I’d like to really talk about is whether or not there was a warrant requirement for the search in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.229" offset="9253616">The existing authority in this Court, it seems to me makes it very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.891" offset="9272320">That a search without a warrant, whether that is a search of a person or of a place is an exceptional search and maybe justified only if the circumstances of that search bring it within one of the exceptions to the warrant required which have been previously established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.442" offset="9358524">The Court said that in Peck, it said it in Katz, said it in Terry and as recently as May of 1973 it said that a warrantless search is an exceptional search in Schneckloth and in Cupp versus Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.493" offset="9430727">So, I think that the Court is historically on record as indicating that even in searches of persons, a warrantless search is the exceptional search unless it comes within one of the existing categories of exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.723" offset="9491644">Now plainly, one of the existing categories of exception is a search incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.705" offset="9519543">This Court has always been talking about what is a search incident to arrest, require that some time, relationship exist between the time of arrest and the time of search and it has done that properly because of the reason for the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.386" offset="9602299">The Court has said that the reason you may search incident to arrest is to one, protect the officer from weapons and two; ascertain the existence of and preserve the destruction of evidence, which may be used in prosecution ultimately arising out of that arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.748" offset="9683696">Now, it seems to me that when either of or both of those purposes of the exception no longer exists, then the exception ought no longer exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.620" offset="9735210">So that, if by the mere passage of time, we have defeated the purpose of the search incident to arrest exception then that exception no longer has application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.039" offset="9788918">Now, the question of a search for weapons was never involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.115" offset="9813159">This was plainly a search for evidence and it is not a search to capture evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.924" offset="9836460">It is a search to ascertain whether or not the evidence ever existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.588" offset="9859135">The passage of time we submit, the minimum of nine or ten hours from the time of arrest until the time that the clothing was taken defeats the purpose of taking the clothing so as to preserve evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.273" offset="10013884">In the one Court of Appeals case which involved a delay of six hours, the court was very emphatic in indicating that during that entire period of time.</text>
