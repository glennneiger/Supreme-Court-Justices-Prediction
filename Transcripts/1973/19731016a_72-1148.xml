            <label>Mr. John W. Osburn</label>
            <text syncTime="22.428" offset="166452">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.332" offset="182126">The sophisticated legal issue which is before the Court in this case involving the presumption of witness truthfulness is an interesting contrast to the factual situation which gave rise to the case and upon which the State Court Trial Jury was called upon to deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.306" offset="265927">The respondent Naughten was convicted in State Trial Court of the crime of armed robbery involving the robbery of a late night pore (ph) and a friend of his who were in the store about mid night.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.223" offset="317649">One night the proprietor was locking the place up and getting ready to close and just before he locked the place, a man came in who witness later identified as the respondent Naughten and brandished the pistol and informed Mr. Livengood according to Livengood's testimony that this was stick up and he then forced the proprietor and the friend into the cooler and told them to wait there until he was finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.248" offset="461740">Then the two men were sitting in the cooler and the friend said to the proprietor, “Well, I think they are gone now”, and so the proprietor went out and the robber had not gone and forced him again back into the cooler.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.845" offset="528091">Then a short time later the friend again suggest that the robber was gone by this time and they came out and proprietor called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.221" offset="569678">The police arrived fairly immediately and it turned out that Mr. Naughten's car had been parked across the street in a tavern parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.629" offset="611265">The police arrived and the proprietor, Mr. Livengood identified the respondent Naughten as being the robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.761" offset="655778">There was no line up or there were no Wade-Gilbert problems, no problems of undue suggestibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.641" offset="695275">Both, the proprietor and the witness had seen Mr. Naughten for approximately a period of 15 minutes, most of which they were in his presence, some part of which they were back in the cooler.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.256" offset="757760">There was also a testimony by two police officers, one who testified that he came in and Mr. Livengood had identified Naughten as the robber, and there was also testimony that at the time that Naughten was handcuffed with his hands behind him that he was attempting to stuff some money into the crack between the seat of the automobile, this money was later retrieved by the police and this essentially was the testimony that was presented at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.455" offset="914599">The defendant's cross-examination consisted primarily, the cross-examination consisted primarily of asking the two eyewitnesses about when they talked about the case, asking about why was that the man who was arrested, who was identified as Naughten, why it was that he did not have a pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.569" offset="1015014">And the defendant didn't present testimony, didnt' call any witnesses, and the case went to the Jury then with the Court's instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.902" offset="1052317">Now the Trial Court instructed the jury that it was the state's burden to prove guilt beyond the reasonable doubt, instructed the jury that the defendant was presumed to be innocent and the jury returned the verdict of guilty.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="259.625" stopTime="275.877">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="259.625" offset="1115220">I take it Mr. Solicitor General that you have reviewed these evidentiary matters in detail, perhaps the purposes of indicating that the guilt was established by overwhelming evidences of it, there is no question --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_w_osburn" startTime="275.877" stopTime="388.633">
            <label>Mr. John W. Osburn</label>
            <text syncTime="275.877" offset="1180212">This is the reason why we tried to present it in this fashion, because it seems to us that on those facts and given the instructions which the Court gave clearly instructed on burden of proof, clearly instructed on presumption of innocence, that it's just inconceivable to me that a lay jury could have taken that instruction about witnesses being presumed to speak the truth and could have turned that on the facts of this case into an instruction which did just the opposite, which placed the burden of proof on the defendant, and this is particularly true in this case because of what occurred at the time that the Jury had received its instruction and counsel took his exceptions to the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.526" offset="1414896">At the time that their prepared instruction were given the Court and defense counsel, the prosecutor and the defendant, in court report, all went in to the Court's chambers and they then considered whether or not there were exceptions to the instructions and the counsel did take some, and one of the instructions which he requested, which he had an answer for was an instruction on that the jury was not to infer guilt from the fact that the defendant didn't take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.508" offset="1534746">This is what this instruction -- of course, there is considerable disagreement among defense counsel as to whether or not this is grid instruction or not, some counsel preferred -- some consider that the instruction is in the words of the Ninth Circuit "Don't put the jelly bean in your nose" instruction, because it simply caused attention to something that the jury might otherwise have overlooked.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="388.633" stopTime="402.555">

            <text syncTime="388.633" offset="1631295">Mr. Solicitor General, despite the overwhelming evidences you say it guilt, I gather the Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court that this was case in which Harrington's harmless errors rules required.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_w_osburn" startTime="402.555" stopTime="404.141">
            <label>Mr. John W. Osburn</label>

            <text syncTime="404.141" offset="1693362">So as it comes to us at least that issue of the harmless error is not before us.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.284" offset="1713842">Well we think that it comes before the Court in two ways and maybe these are subtle statements of the same principle.</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Osburn</label>
            <text syncTime="420.998" offset="1760758">Yes, we have raised both of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.245" offset="1773714">The first way of stating it is this, that the instruction itself, while it does present a colorable constitutional issue, because it's been discussed in the various circuits, in a constitutional context, and the courts have generally not given good marks to this instruction, that our position is, it's just not that bad, that it should result in the reversal in federal habeas corpus of a jury verdict on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.512" offset="1922821">That it's just inconceivable that on the facts of the case and given the clear precise instructions that the Court gave that a jury could possibly have even understood what the legal issue was all about.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="476.841" stopTime="486.404">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="476.841" offset="1984157">So you suggest that the Ninth Circuit apparently adopted the view that any constitutional error which is quite judicial per se and that's what obligated the harmless error determination?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_w_osburn" startTime="486.404" stopTime="521.945">
            <label>Mr. John W. Osburn</label>
            <text syncTime="486.404" offset="2022400">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.531" offset="2026893">Now, they also found that none of other instructions which the Trial Judge had given specifically obviated the problem that is involved in this instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.857" offset="2080183">Well, we think that it did because the jury was called back or rather the court and parties went back into the courtroom and after the jury has been sitting there and they are called back into the courtroom and court again gave them some instruction which says that the burden of proof is on the defendant and that --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="521.945" stopTime="523.732">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="521.945" offset="2164506">You say not presented.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_w_osburn" startTime="523.732" stopTime="695.886">
            <label>Mr. John W. Osburn</label>
            <text syncTime="523.732" offset="2171716">Pardon me, the burden of proof is on the State, that the State must prove its guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant is presumed to be innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.243" offset="2205675">Now we certainly recognized that it's fundamental to our law that a guilt of the defendant in a criminal case must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.756" offset="2251755">It's not quite so clear that an instruction must be given to a State Tourt trial jury that the defendant is presumed to be innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.406" offset="2282371">Nevertheless that is an instruction which is always given under our state law and which was given in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.800" offset="2315912">Now, then the question is what is there about the presumption instruction that suddenly shifts the burden to the defendant, even though the Court said time and again that the defendant had no burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.286" offset="2385920">Well, the argument goes that where the defendant does not testify and where the defendant does not present any evidence or call any witnesses, that the instruction really amounts to a presumption of that witnesses who are called by the State have told the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.440" offset="2462511">Because the instruction is expressed in terms of a rebuttable presumption, every witness is presumed to speak the truth, says the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.559" offset="2498978">This presumption may be overcome by the manner in which the witness testifies, by the nature of his or her testimony, by evidence affecting his or her character, interest or motives, by contradictory evidence or by a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.792" offset="2559896">Now, the instruction says in its very words that while the witness is presumed to speak the truth, that the witness himself may overcome that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.147" offset="2609319">The presumption may be overcome by the manner in which the witness testifies, by the nature of his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.752" offset="2631784">The jury was again told at later place in the instructions that you are not bound to find in conformity with the testimony of the declarations of any number of witnesses which do not produce belief in your minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.043" offset="2692911">Now we have tried as is our lawyerly duty in the brief to explain why the instruction is given, to explain what it is intended to convey, and I think essentially it simply intended to convey the impression to the jury that the jury is there to hear the testimony, they are there to hear to witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.296" offset="2785907">They may begin with a presumption that a person who is sworn on oath, is not going to commit perjury and until there is something that occurs, something about the way the witness testifies, something about the way he looks or the nature of what he says that convinces a person that he is not telling the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.621" offset="4339252">The Appendix, Page 15, the judge instructs the jury on what a presumption means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.886" offset="4364330">A presumption is a deduction which the law expressly directs to be made from particular facts and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.860" offset="4452206">Now, it's our position that the truthfulness presumption is in direct contradiction in terms, in theory, and in effect to the constitutional burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.399" offset="4598387">The burden of proof means a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.712" offset="4615628">It can mean the burden of pleading, the burden of proceeding with the evidence, the burden of persuasion, and the only meaning it can really have that has any effect is the burden of persuading the jury of the truth of the allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.133" offset="4677277">And so by saying that you were to presume that whatever these witnesses say is true, seems to me that's in direct contradiction to the concept of the burden of proof being on the State.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1165.622" offset="4739239">But suppose counsel that this instruction had been given before any evidence went in as some trial judges in some courts do; give some general instructions of the jurors, particularly jurors at the outset of their service will grasp the burden of proof concept before they hear the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.623" offset="4847282">Now, suppose these instructions had been given in advance, would you think that would lighten the problem any?</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.859" offset="4876225">Now it makes a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.760" offset="4879778">I think the position of the State seems to be that may be the instruction was given at the beginning, because perhaps when the witness first gets on the stand, you might accord him certain deference that he will not either lie or make innocent errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.981" offset="4944666">But, now we are dealing with a situation where the witnesses have already testified and now you are telling the Jury that they must presume that these witnesses in fact have testified truthfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.690" offset="4991478">And I would like to contrast that with another point in time where we talk about the truthfulness of witnesses and that's on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.085" offset="5025123">I have cited innumerable cases where the comment is made that witnesses should be presumed to have told the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.513" offset="5054798">And here we are doing a completely difference thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.700" offset="5063576">Now, we are looking back on the case and saying was there sufficient evidence to go to the Jury, and in testing the sufficiency of evidence of course, we take the case in most favorable state and by doing that we presume that the witnesses did tell the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.770" offset="5127837">But, that only gets us pass the question of whether the case should go to the Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.600" offset="5147167">And now what we are doing in this case is what State is saying, the Judge is saying, this evidence is sufficient, therefore it goes to the Jury, and secondly you must presume that this sufficient evidence is in fact true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.198" offset="5201502">And it seems to me then that there is really no difference at all between the sufficiency of evidence rule which may simply mean that there is some evidence and the rule that the burden of persuasion lies with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.292" offset="5257927">It seems to me they are hopelessly confused by this instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.952" offset="5272555">But, I would say that if the instruction were given at the outset, it certainly would make more sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.998" offset="5308709">Now, it's inescapable, we have to talk about presumption and inference cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.170" offset="5333473">I am taking the position, of course, that this is not really a true presumption at all because a presumption is a situation where you have a fact proved and the Jury has told that from that they should deduce a second fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.581" offset="5387076">In this case it seems to me there is no proved fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.819" offset="5400033">But, I think it's important to distinguish the line of cases in this Court, the most recent one being Barnes from the Spring, working all the way back through Gainy, Romano, Todd, Bowen, Black and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.950" offset="5464503">Firstly all of which it seems to me involve inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.624" offset="5479236">In other words, the Jury has told, you may if you wish link these two facts together in your minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.514" offset="5510792">In this case the Jury has told you are expressly directed to link these two facts in your minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.299" offset="5537959">Now, the reformulation of the inference rule in Barnes seems to be that the Judge may instruct on an inference, if a rational juror -- this is not in my brief, because I think that was decided about the time I was in printer’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.537" offset="5630851">If a rational juror would be able to link the two facts and find that the presumed fact beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.286" offset="5669930">But, that's in a mere inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.077" offset="5677035">Here we are telling the Jury that you must find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.163" offset="5689365">And in that case it seems to me that Judge can give the instruction only if a Judge himself would find that the facts are linked beyond a reasonable doubt, because the Jury has no option at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.493" offset="5758746">They must find this fact to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.838" offset="5772121">And if I can make a comment about Vlandis against Kline which is a whole another situation from the Spring involving an irrebuttable presumption in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.779" offset="5831889">I take it that the rebuttable presumption in this case is one not lower than Vlandis against Kline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.100" offset="5861146">But you will notice in Vlandis the Court holds that that kind of an irrebutabble presumption can be used only when the fact would follow necessarily and uniformly and certainly we are not asking for that much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.043" offset="5928960">We are only asking that the judge be able to find beyond a reasonable doubt not uniformly and exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.915" offset="5972428">Now, the opinions from the other courts, both within the last ten years and over a hundred year span, indicate first that the presumption of truthfulness is not a standard exception for the reasonable doubt standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.268" offset="6073783">It has never been simply included as part of the package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.813" offset="6087993">Secondly, every time the presumption of truthfulness seems to raise its head particularly in last ten years, it becomes crushed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.579" offset="6127073">Now, in the Circuit Courts, every time the presumption of truthfulness raises its head the Court seemed to crush it in one session or another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.451" offset="10198518">Well, your argument does rest on our acceptance of your proposition that this was a constitutional error, instruction is a constitutional error, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2539.880" offset="10236238">Absolutely, and the fact that the evidence was sufficient does not mean that the error was harmless, because you can stack up 15 or 20 witnesses and if you presume that they have all told the truth, then you would never have a burden on the State and any case would be harmless.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.138" offset="10461309">No I think the only relevant point is what if the juror complied with the instructions, what logical steps would he take in reaching his burden, apart from the quantity or the quality of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.789" offset="10519928">Although I would point out that we are -- accepting the state's argument on harmless error that it could be harmless, where was the gun 10 minutes after the robbery, where was the so-called raincoat the robber wore, why was he driving the car and there were two other people in the car, why did the police arrested three defendants in the car and only charged one with the crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.735" offset="10627657">It seems to me there is some doubt here about guilt and innocence which the jury might have considered, if they were not require the believe the state's witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.617" offset="10699233">We assume I think as lawyers that the words that we say in a courtroom are hung on by the jury and that they attach great significance to them, and we have talked now both in briefs and in oral argument about this instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.019" offset="10764852">Remember this is an instruction that went to the jury in about 15 seconds and they heard that middle of all kinds of other instructions about other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.970" offset="10800588">We ask a great deal of jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.258" offset="10809783">We bring people in who are cab drivers and housewives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.322" offset="10826083">We sit them down in a courtroom and we parade witnesses in front of them and then ask people to make a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.508" offset="10850743">We think the fact finding system here was fair that the adequate evidence was presented, and that there was nothing essentially wrong with the standard which was employed by the court, that instruction is not a model but it's just not that bad.</text>
