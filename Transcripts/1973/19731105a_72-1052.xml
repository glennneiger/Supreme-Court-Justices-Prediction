            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We'll hear arguments next in 72-1052, Morton against Ruiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.338" offset="234057">Mr. Sachse, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="41.554" offset="242939">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.692" offset="255478">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.291" offset="285884">That Court held essentially that a supplemental welfare benefit that the Bureau of Indian Affairs provides for Indians who live on reservations and Indians who live within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Oklahoma and Alaska must be applied, must be made available for Indians throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.172" offset="401450">The Court did that not on constitutional ground but as an interpretation of the statutes under which the program is conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.885" offset="444291">We think that that’s a misinterpretation of those statutes and then it would require the Bureau of Indian Affairs to conduct a program that Congress has not appropriated money for.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.813" offset="496013">And it’s on that basis that we ask the Court to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.388" offset="526315">I’d like to take a minute to describe what the program is that we’re talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.226" offset="557662">Through the Social Security Act, there are four or five, I think its four types of categorical welfare assistance, aid for dependent children, aid for the blind, and so forth that under Federal sponsorship available throughout the country through the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.521" offset="646792">There's another which is under a different legislation, the Unemployment Insurance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.084" offset="681064">But what’s missing from this program that is available throughout the United States is anything in the way of a general assistance program that will give money to able-bodied people who are chronically out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.175" offset="745430">Now this is the issue that the country has faced in terms or perhaps has failed to face in terms of a negative income tax or some sort of income maintenance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.563" offset="799033">Because this is missing from the Federal legislation, the States have done with it pretty much as it please.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.647" offset="831321">And some states have fairly important income assistance programs, others do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.943" offset="864549">Some states do it on a statewide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.950" offset="876565">Others do it county by county.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.578" offset="891089">But the situation became clear that in the -- in Indian reservation where the Indian tribe itself has the basic government and where that government is under the direct supervision of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.063" offset="969038">That the Federal Government ought to undertake this kind of income maintenance program and it did undertake this kind of program in a cash payment program rather than giving provisions which had been done earlier in the early 1950s and this is the program that we’re talking about, a program that has some flaws in it that has worked fairly well.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.030" offset="1076872">Some people think, other people think that it tends to discourage people from going out and getting jobs but this is the program and the questions whether Indians who are off reservations have a right to this program under the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.639" offset="1155344">And eventually, I suppose the question is whether it's constitutional to make this discrimination on the basis of residence on a reservation.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="279.366" offset="1194214">Suppose Mr. Sachse you had in this particular company the Indian who is in question here and I suppose the number of whites -- Caucasians worked for this same company, they’re all on strike and they’re all living in the same town, under the Ninth Circuit holding, is it correct that the Indian would get some benefits that the white strikers would not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="304.433" offset="1294524">That’s correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.930" offset="1300480">The Ninth Circuit has held as we read the opinion that since the Bureau of Indian Affairs provides this supplemental welfare program for Indians on reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.068" offset="1344993">It must provide it for Indians everywhere or at least in a narrow screening decision is that it must provide it for Indians in this situation of Mr. Ruiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.224" offset="1381669">That would mean Mr. Ruiz would get these benefits whereas the other strikers would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.505" offset="1406746">I’d like to take a minute just to state what you’ve already alluded to and that is the situation Mr. Ruiz here, Mr. and Mrs. Ruiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.751" offset="1455752">Mr. and Mrs. Ruiz are Papago Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.547" offset="1470903">As far as I know, full blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.763" offset="1479784">They lived on the Papago Reservation until 1939 or 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.104" offset="1505176">That time, Mr. Ruiz moved 16 miles away to a town called Ajo.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.110" offset="1533179">He moved there --</text>

            <text syncTime="370.326" offset="1558047">He moved there, he got a job in the copper mines and he apparently worked steadily in those copper mines until 1967, at which time the plant went out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.338" offset="1614054">Nobody under Arizona Law, none of the striking workers were entitled to general assistance or unemployment compensation payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.072" offset="1672986">Mr. Ruiz unable to get the Arizona payments applied to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to see whether he could get payments there and he was denied those payments on the basis that he did not, neither he nor his wife resided on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.647" offset="1743308">Now, I’d like to discuss the statutes that under which the bureau operates this program.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.546" offset="1786984">Suppose that this particular applicant was able to work at the mines but the reservation was right across the street and he maintained his residence on the reservation, would he have been eligible under some other program at that time?</text>

            <text syncTime="459.263" offset="1913835">Be very much as if you have people who live in the State of New York who go to work in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.712" offset="1943615">The person who still lives in New York will get whatever benefits the State of New York offers I supposed and people who moved from the State of New York and moved in to New Jersey then are under -- get whatever benefits New Jersey supplies rather than New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.218" offset="2321659">The strike lasted about 11 months and it’s over.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.613" offset="2351229">On the statutory base, I want to say first that the President, Sec -- through delegation, Secretary of Interior and Director of Bureau of Indian Affairs have very broad authority under 25 U.S.C. 2 and 25 U.S.C. 9 to make such rules and regulations and decisions as are necessary in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.092" offset="2465123">But the Act that we’re primarily concerned with here is the Snyder Act which was passed in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.613" offset="2511203">And I think the Act is clear on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.188" offset="2529489">It’s the Authorization Act of Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide health, education, welfare and all sorts of other services to Indians wherever they live in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.410" offset="2594377">We don’t say that this Act prohibits the Bureau of Indian Affairs from doing things for Indians off reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.907" offset="2628336">But I think it’s quite clear that the Act simply is the Authorization Act as it created no programs and legislative history is clear on this too that to solve points of order that there was no authorization for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Congress passed this particular act.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.345" offset="2698136">I won’t burden the Court with going through what I’ve done in detail in the brief there.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.868" offset="2724258">The language of it is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.916" offset="2728438">The Bureau of Indian Affairs under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior shall direct, supervise and expend such moneys as Congress may from time to time, appropriate, for the benefit, care, and assistance of the Indians throughout the United States for the following purposes: General support civilization, including education.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.265" offset="2805760">At the time this Act was passed there was no general support program, financial support program neither on or off Indian reservations or in the country as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.027" offset="2844839">Social Legislation of 1930s hadn’t been passed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.913" offset="2872424">I thought it's a hard question.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.985" offset="2888725">I think that the respondents are really reaching to take the language in that Act and to say that it commands the Secretary of the Interior, institute a welfare program and that that Welfare program must be for Indians both on and off the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.385" offset="2978273">And one, I would say certainly neutral observer of this Act, Mr. Wolf who at one point, I think had some role in representing the respondents in this case.</text>
