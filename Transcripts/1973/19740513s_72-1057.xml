            <text syncTime="18.300" offset="149943">The Giordano case number 72-1057 comes here from the Fourth Circuit on certiorari, and Chavez from the Ninth Circuit on -- also on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.323" offset="202083">These two cases raise related questions under the Federal Statute, authorizing official wiretapping under a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.937" offset="252447">Under the statute only the Attorney General or an assistant Attorney General, specially authorized by him is permitted to approve an application or a wiretap order.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.329" offset="310021">In the Giordano case, the Attorney General had authorized his executive assistant to approve wiretap applications, in the name of the Attorney General when that officer was absent from the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.185" offset="381492">The question is whether that procedure comports with the Act, and if it is not whether the evidence obtained from a wiretap under an order that was so authorized is admissible or inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.271" offset="453799">We hold that an application approved in that manner does not comply with the Act, and that evidence obtained from a wiretap under such an order, where the application has been so approved, is admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.921" offset="528405">The Court of Appeals had arrived at the same conclusion, and so we affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.491" offset="574694">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.232" offset="617639">Mr. Justice Powell has filed an opinion dissenting from part four of the opinion.</text>
