            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="41.736" offset="243670">The ultimate question on the merits as I indicated before is the same here and the same jurisdictional questions arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.416" offset="274390">After being classified I-O which means that a conscientious objector opposed to any participation in war in any form, even in noncombatant duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.155" offset="325381">Robison took a job in May 1968 at a hospital in Boston where he resided, he was going to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.267" offset="361848">Under procedures, I’ll describe later, he asked the local board to sign him to that hospital for his alternative service required under the Selective Service Laws which he was entitled to in lieu of induction having claimed his exemption from service as a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.164" offset="441365">In August 1968, the local board ordered him to work at the hospital he had selected, effective the preceding may and he would have, at that time been classified I-W which is a classification of people who were I-O and have been ordered to do alternative service and I may use those terms for convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.519" offset="538854">Two years later in May 1970, he finished his alternative service and quit his hospital job and having continued at school at night he graduated from college in 1970 as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.482" offset="598727">In 1971, he applied, he got to law school and he applied to the VA for educational benefits under chapter 34 of Title 38 (b) 1966 Veterans’ Readjustment Benefits Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.053" offset="661002">The VA decided that he was ineligible because he did not come within the statutory definition of eligible veterans to whom such benefits are made available because he had not been on active duty as those terms are defined in Title 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.153" offset="741355">In February 1972, a complaint was filed against the VA and the administrator as a class action for all persons who had served the alternative service and completed their service, and seeking a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional in extending benefits to veterans of military service, but not to persons who had rendered alternative service.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.857" offset="852219">They also sought a declaratory judgment that plaintiff and members of the class were entitled to receive these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.184" offset="885447">No injunctions or other specific relief was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.212" offset="905613">Now, the ultimate question here as in Hernandez on the merits is whether it is unconstitutional for Congress to extend certain fringe benefits to a specified category of federal employee, namely certain members of the uniform services and not to extend them to anyone else, who might share some of the circumstances for a background in common with some of those receiving benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.571" offset="1018984">I think it might help to provide some background about the statutory scheme involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.951" offset="1060571">Congress has of course in number of specifically enumerated powers pertaining to the Armed Forces and under the Constitution and for at least as long as this country has required the services of Armed Forces and its employee, it has exercised these powers to provide benefits to veterans of various types of veterans of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.816" offset="1139984">The first Veterans’ Pension Law was passed in 1789 for example for veterans of the revolutionary war and the history of veterans’ benefits maybe traced ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.811" offset="1187944">At present, Congress has established a number of programs for veterans of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.677" offset="1211455">Some are contractual in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.642" offset="1219291">Some are non-contractual, involving essentially fortuitous benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.512" offset="1238831">They have a variety of eligibility restrictions and each one has to be taken separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.272" offset="1261819">We deal here only with the program concerning educational benefits under Chapter 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.988" offset="1288673">Now, the educational benefits program reflects a number of policy decisions by Congress in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.869" offset="1320229">One of course was the level of benefits which is not as generous as the benefits provided to veterans of Korean War or World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.322" offset="1362024">The benefits available to anyone of these plaintiffs is under the law -- under most circumstance is not to be likely to exceed $10,000 because of adjustment for the number of dependents and you would need a great number of dependents to be entitled to $10,000 over the course of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.531" offset="1462857">The program is not intended to subsidize education, but merely provide partial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.431" offset="1486472">It’s available, however, without regard to the needs for the benefits and it’s also available without regard to whether your education has in fact been disrupted or hindered.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.784" offset="1539866">One limitation in the statute is that you be a veteran as defined in Title 38 which means a person who has served active duty aligned in Military Forces, the Air Force, and who has not been dishonorably discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.820" offset="1623980">The 1966 Act further limits the category of eligible veteran for the purpose of Chapter 34, the educational benefits to a person who has more than 180 days of active duty, again, a person who was discharged under the conditions other than dishonorable or of discharged for a service-connected disability.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="424.456" offset="1774550">Under the 1957 version of Title 38, active duty was defined in a way as to include active duty by commissioned officers of those two organizations within the terms active duty for veterans’ benefits purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.471" offset="1850619">So that unless Congress took affirmative action to exclude them, they would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.636" offset="1867337">Now, this reflects a historic equation of service in these two organizations to military service that goes back to World War I days.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.485" offset="1918642">These organizations have historically been at from time to time under the direct control of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.452" offset="1950511">They have reserved course, they have military structures, they are at times subject to military duty and for purposes of pay and allowances they are included with the military in Title 37 covering compensation of the uniform services.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.162" offset="2021355">We -- the statutory background is rather detailed and we haven’t developed it in our brief and if the Court would like, we’d be happy to submit a supplemental memorandum on that point, but there was no affirmative provision of the 1966 Act which dealt with those categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.017" offset="2116859">There were several other decisions made in 1966 by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.355" offset="2130129">It was a question whether to extend these benefits only to people who had active duty in the military zone or hostilities, but the purpose was broader than rewarding such service so that the Act is broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.856" offset="2184150">There was a question whether to limit benefits to draftees or the men who had enlisted and again the statute had various purposes which ended up being served by including both.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.853" offset="2228140">As I understand, the claims in these cases if the statute had been narrower and had not extended benefits as far as it does, we might not have a case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.713" offset="2267638">The position is that Congress should have indeed was constitutionally obliged to go even further than it did.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_p_norton" startTime="594.025" stopTime="986.943">
            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="594.025" offset="2452898">Well, that’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.811" offset="2456033">If you look one purpose and try to measure all of the benefits in terms of that one purpose that it might be a problem, but there are multiple purposes here and each recipient of the benefits need not be justified by each of the purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.943" offset="2512562">I think there’s been a tendency to crisscross the lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.474" offset="2530638">Essentially, the plaintiff's case comes down to the contention that looking only at people who were drafted into military service and conscientious objectors who performed alternative service, there are absolutely no factual distinctions between the nature of the service rendered that would permit the Congress rationally to conclude that it was an inappropriate action to extend benefits to veterans of military service and not to anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.192" offset="2653518">Now, we think it claimed that Congress took a different view that Congress realized that there were a number of unique and distinctive features of military service which could have supported this distinction so that the distinction cannot be said to be illusory or utterly lacking in substance or any of the other terms that this Court has said must be supported in order to say that the classification is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.764" offset="2787788">Let me turn now to some of the distinctions that Congress had in mind either explicitly or in the nature of things, it could recently have -- had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.656" offset="2855393">For one thing, someone who was drafted into the military service has an obligation of six years, four of which after active duty are in the reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.364" offset="2898233">The person who serves alternative service as a conscientious objector has a maximum obligation of two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.506" offset="2922789">Now, that reserve obligation is not merely a theoretical possibility as it can involve the burdens of training in weekend or summer time duty or other duty and Congress had in mind particularly in 1965 and 1966 when this Act was being considered, the fact that in only a few years before it had been necessary to call up the reserves in connection with the Berlin crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.346" offset="3022158">So this was something that was explicitly discussed and it’s a very significant distinction between the two kinds of service because as Congress indicated having this additional liability hanging over his head, a person in the military has a kind of disruption and continuing disruption of his plans and his educational plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.965" offset="3116617">Now, there is the additional fact that service in the military involves the possibility of being sent anywhere in the world to face a variety of dangerous or hostile conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.669" offset="3163429">In the District Court, Robison agreed that it was unquestionable that military service was a hazardous and vigorous demanding than alternative service.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.132" offset="3217241">There is been some suggestion in the briefs that conscientious objectors at times do serve abroad, but in fact that it’s the policy of the selective service and was the policy not to order anyone to report for work overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.141" offset="3277322">Persons who ended up doing alternative duty overseas were ones who had indicated a willingness to work for one of the -- or established organizations who did overseas service and knew that that was what they’re going to do and what they’re getting into and even then they would not be assigned overseas, but would be assigned to work for a group base in this country who then might use their services overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.180" offset="3385469">There is also a very substantial difference in the way in which these two groups select or influence the work they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.058" offset="3433012">I think the influence that a draftee has over where he works and what he does is notoriously limited, if there is any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.450" offset="3474599">He does what he is told and goes where he is told.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.706" offset="3487556">However, under the regulations that were in existence in 1965 and 1966 and continued until 1971, a person doing alternative service had considerable opportunity to influence those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.651" offset="3543353">It could as Robison did submit up to three types of employment that he was qualified and willing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.480" offset="3578671">If the local board found anyone of them appropriate, it would then order him to do one of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.491" offset="3610749">If they did not find anyone appropriate, then they would come up with three and submit them to the registrant and if he didn’t find anyone of those satisfactory, then they would have a conference with the state director.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.332" offset="3658083">And if they still couldn’t work out something and finally the local board did have the authority to order the registrant to do work, but only with the approval of the national director.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.660" offset="3699357">This is a far cry from the situation presented to a military draftee.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.820" offset="3720046">That man understandably that a selective -- that a conscientious objector who was going to alternative service had much greater opportunity to fit his service inconsistent with other obligations he might have such as pursuing his education as Mr. Robison was able to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.155" offset="3801339">Of course the pay, but I think it is important to note one does apprehension of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.253" offset="3829760">The District Court quotes a what is cited as a regulation of the selective service which permitted local boards to assign and abruptly reassign persons who were doing alternative service anywhere at anytime even in combat zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.091" offset="3901127">Now, selective service in knows of no such regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.382" offset="3926309">It is not contained in the regulation that is cited in a District Court’s opinion and there was none such that was into factoring the period that Congress was considering this Act or since.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.673" offset="3979389">We simply don’t know where it came from and I think there’s a reference on it to one of the briefs which is based on the District Court’s use of it in the opinion, but again, there’s no way we can track it down.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.943" offset="4024529">Mr. Norton, I take it that Judge Geraghty rejected the disposition of the government's that there is a rational distinction between those who were subject to being assigned to hazardous combat duty and those who were not on the grounds that Congress had intended to rely on that distinction, that it probably could have, but I gather he said that wasn’t what Congress had in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.899" offset="4136333">We’re saying that even if you look at all military draftees, the nature of the disruption of their lives was quantitatively and qualitatively different from that of anyone else who was affected by the selective service laws and that Congress could rationally conclude that given these various distinctions that it was appropriate to extend benefits to the military draftees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.295" offset="4241972">Even if you were to accept that the contention that alternative service veterans, if you will, had some disruption of their educations and hence had some need of the same kind of benefit, I think it is permissible certainly under this Court’s decisions in Jefferson against Hackney for Congress to distinguish between different categories of people who might share in some general way a characteristic and extend benefits in a differential fashion as long as the distinction, the classification is not altogether illusory or utterly lacking in any rational meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.796" offset="4431935">Well, we say that the test that has been announced in this Court’s decisions is the former that could it rationally have been conceived -- is there a state of facts that might have been conceived to justify this distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.144" offset="4485329">But we say in addition that there were distinctions that were directly addressed by Congress which support this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.298" offset="4517930">And another one that Congress specifically mentioned was the fact that military veterans have been subjected to deprivations of liberty and loss of freedom, inherent in military discipline and military life, is subject to the universal uniform code of military justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.791" offset="4587938">And this kind of existence for two or more years creates additional transition problems in returning to civilian life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.099" offset="4625136">There is also the related to a fact that in the military someone may after serving be discharged on grounds other than the honorable indeed in dishonorable grounds because of things done in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.311" offset="4697966">Whereas someone who was doing alternative service does not face that possibility if they complete their two years even though they may have done something which would’ve warranted a dishonorable discharged in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.361" offset="4750211">They have no such adverse consequence attaching to their service and this has a direct bearing in this case because a veteran of military service served is otherwise within the definition of an eligible veteran but for some reason was dishonorably discharged would not be entitled to these benefits and if under the District Court’s decision here if someone who did alternative service committed the same offense, they would be entitled to it, so that the result of the decision below is to place alternative service people in a somewhat more favored position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.567" offset="5130971">Now, this was not a part of the scheme, the regulatory scheme when Congress was considering the Veterans’ Benefits Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.268" offset="5161796">This is under a regulation and it was not adopted until 1971 and it can have no bearing of course on the rationality of the judgment made by Congress in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.689" offset="5203487">Similarly, there are repeated references to guidelines issued by the Director of the Selective Service to the effect that the disruption of alternative service person’s life should be comparable to that of someone in the military.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.941" offset="5360536">A draftee during let’s say the period that Mr. Robison started work was paid I think, at the rate of about $100 a month.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.463" offset="13290580">Just a few comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.022" offset="13304790">With respect to the last remark about the public attitude toward conscientious objectors and suggestion that Congress had a purpose of somehow penalizing people who were conscientiously opposed to participation in war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.249" offset="13373753">There is not a shred of evidence of any such intention under laying the classification embodied in the 1966 statute, that is conceded in the plaintiff’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.221" offset="13429656">What they have done is gone back to a various things said in World War II, very different circumstances, different public attitude towards war, towards conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.803" offset="13479915">The attitudes and views expressed then by the congressmen have no bearing on what happen in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.535" offset="13510844">Indeed, I think the Court has acknowledged that the Congress has demonstrated an increasing degree of accommodation to the views of conscientious objectors in the statutes that have been enacted as time has gone on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.080" offset="13561104">I think it’s wholly unsupported contention to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.187" offset="13589525">The comment concerning the statement of purposes and the Act underlines one of the deficiencies of the District Court's approach in this case we believe and he took a very strict and narrow reading of the purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.236" offset="13653682">Now, this Court has never said that the Court is confined to an explicit statement of purposes in considering the validity of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.420" offset="13686387">Indeed in the Moreno case, the Food Stamp case last year, the Court first considered the explicit purposes that were stated and then went on to consider whether they were other possible purposes that might have justified the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.809" offset="13739990">It's a perfectly proper and established approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.252" offset="13753783">Now, there is one continuing misapprehension that pervades the argument on the other side and that is that there is in the statute an exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.199" offset="13801535">The statute is not in terms to exclude anyone, all it does, is extend benefits to a defined category of persons who rendered military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.462" offset="13842599">People who rendered alternative service are not the only people who denied benefits; everyone else who is not within that category is denied benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.404" offset="13874364">Someone who has conscientious objection to participation in war and who does not happen to fall within the statutory exemption, and therefore, he goes to prison instead as Mr. Gillette chose to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.569" offset="13939043">His life was disrupted by the Selective Service laws but he is finally not entitled to benefits.</text>
