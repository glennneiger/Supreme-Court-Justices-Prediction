            <text syncTime="46.460" offset="262583">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.018" offset="276793">This case arises on a motion to suppress in connection with respondents as yet untried inditement for bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.505" offset="330815">Respondent was arrested by local police officers at about 9:30 a.m. in the yard of a farmhouse rented by Mr. and Mrs. Walter Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.284" offset="397897">Immediately after his arrest, three officers went to the door of the Marshall house and were admitted by the Marshall's 21-year-old daughter, Mrs. Gayle Graff who had her three-year-old son with her and apparently, they were the only ones in the house at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.231" offset="493714">The officers had no search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.470" offset="506671">They told her that they were looking for money and a gun and asked if they could come in and make a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.753" offset="539794">She consented and in response to their questions, told the officers that she and the respondent jointly occupied an upstairs bedroom in which they slept in the same bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.222" offset="609593">She specifically gave them permission to search that room.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.320" offset="630073">They found that it contained a double bed with two pillows on it which gave the appearance of having been slept in and there was men's and women's clothing in the closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.382" offset="682318">There was also a four drawer bureau, two drawers of which contained men's clothing and two drawers of which contained women's clothing including underclothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.072" offset="732996">And Mrs. Graff told the officers that the respondent has the two bottom drawers and at the top two drawers were hers.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.276" offset="777822">In the closet, the officers found a diaper bag half filled with a large amount of cash, several thousand dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.276" offset="825887">The Government's petition in this Court contest only the suppression by the courts below of this cash found in the closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.887" offset="864340">No issue is raised in this Court with respect to two later searches or the suppression of some of the items found during those searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.259" offset="913763">The District Court--now I have recounted only the facts known to the officers at the time they conducted the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.330" offset="946051">The District Court--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="220.835" offset="960052">It was at a later point in the day not at the time of the consent that this lady said that she was the common law wife of the respondent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="230.393" stopTime="465.940">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="230.393" offset="998296">She did not make that remark later in the day at the police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.057" offset="1036957">The District Court held and the facts that I have recounted that prior to the search of the issue, it reasonably appeared to the searching officers that Mrs. Graff had the right to consent to the search or in other words, it was reasonable for the officers to rely on her consent in making the search but the Court held that this satisfied only one part of a two-pronged test that the Government must meet in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.243" offset="1169763">It held that the Government must also prove that she actually have the right to consent to the search and it further held that excluding all hearsay, testimony which was introduced to show the actual right.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.190" offset="1241548">The Government had failed to meet its burden on the second prong of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.986" offset="1268715">The Court of Appeals affirmed in all respects although there was a difference between the two courts in the formulation of the burden of proof on the Government to which I shall allude later.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.146" offset="1317303">Our principal contention in this Court is that the two-pronged test applied by the courts below is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.987" offset="1364741">In conducting an investigation, we contend police officers must act on the basis of the facts as they appear at the time of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.270" offset="1421793">What the Fourth Amendment requires is that their action be reasonable at the time it is undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.571" offset="1463066">Just as an entry made without probable cause cannot be validated by what the search later turns up, so the reverse is also true.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.589" offset="1519073">A subsequent discovery that the police were misled by deceptive appearances does not invalidate the search if it was reasonable for them to rely on those appearances in undertaking the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.023" offset="1596813">That was the holding of this Court in Hill against California in 401 U.S. 797 in which the police conducted a search incident to the arrest of a man, they reasonably but mistakenly believed to be the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.076" offset="1693048">And in that case, the Court emphasized that sufficient probability, not certainty is the touchstone of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment and said that the arrest in that case was again "a reasonable response to the situation facing them, the police officers at that time".</text>
            <text syncTime="437.639" offset="1827318">Similarly here, the courts below correctly found, finding that it is not a challenge in this Court that the officers responded reasonably to the situation they found.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.674" offset="1891474">Since their glass was at total absence of official misconduct, there was, we contend no Fourth Amendment violation.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="465.940" offset="1940480">I gather Mr. Wallace, what bother Judge Doyle and Judge Morgan and the Court of Appeals was an example, a both side of the possibility that you could have a valid consent under your theory given by a complete imposter.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.551" offset="2002965">Does your theory have someway of dealing with that? Do you accept that as the logical conclusion of your line of argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="489.356" stopTime="575.800">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="489.356" offset="2034207">Well, that is not with the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.286" offset="2049881">We think that Hill against California says a great deal about that hypothetical situation but I think that the answer has to be that what inquiries are reasonable on the part of the police officers depends on the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.870" offset="2124278">Here, there was no reason for them to doubt and that she was rightfully in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.198" offset="2153535">It was 9:30 in the morning, she answered the door with her little child with her and she had previously come out of the door to find out what was going on with respect to the arrest of the respondent whom she referred to as Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.145" offset="2249352">There was every indication that they resided in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.871" offset="2268264">So, I don't think the Court need deal with the situation of an imposter until that case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.623" offset="2299193">So, one might surmise that an imposter for example, a burglar would be reluctant to consent to a search because of the problem that he might then be arrested if something were found by the officers and it would then be found out that he was not rightfully there.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="575.800" offset="2379964">Well, let's take an extreme situation Mr. Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.039" offset="2392921">Let's assumed that the meter readers on the porch or up in the yard and they asked him if they may enter and the door is open and he said "be my guest", the usual vernacular and they go in, would you say that that's covered by your rule too?</text>

            <text syncTime="598.298" offset="2469930">If it had reasonably appeared to the police officers, reasonably appeared to them that he had the authority to consent to the search that he was consenting to.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="611.997" offset="2524787">Well, we don't need to because as I say, the facts here were such that it was readily apparent that she was residing in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.130" offset="2585287">I think that the general principle really is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.289" offset="2609946">I don't see that the Fourth Amendment has any meaning except that the police in conducting their investigations have to act reasonably in the context of the situation as it appears to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.785" offset="2667938">Not just, as it appear to them in good faith, but as it reasonably appears to them.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="651.873" offset="2684238">Well, among other things, is this might be relevant then on the hypothetical case I gave you.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.396" offset="2706286">It might be relevant to find out whether they ask the man, "Do you live here?"</text>
            <text syncTime="664.564" offset="2735020">And if he--they had asked him that question and he said, "Yes, I do", you might have one result.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.797" offset="2767935">And if they didn't ask him that question, you might conceivably have another result.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="679.063" offset="2793012">I think differences in the circumstances would indicate that it would be reasonable for them to ask additional questions in some situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.098" offset="2833136">In this case, although they did not ask her where she slept, she volunteered that information to them before they undertook the search and there was no need for them to ask.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.284" offset="2893845">You think they might not have to ask her very much after the objective evidence that she was lawfully there and perhaps live there.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="714.691" offset="2935536">Yes, there might be some question that she might be a domestic employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.185" offset="2961450">In this case, it was apparent from her conduct that she was not addressing the respondent as if she were a domestic employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.229" offset="3005649">Besides which she identified the room where the two of them slept as being her room and stated that her clothing was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.636" offset="3047340">And I think the courts below correctly held that it was reasonable for the police officers to act on that information.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="754.105" offset="3093211">Did the officers at that time know that she was a Marshall daughter, and that the Marshalls owned the house?</text>

            <text syncTime="766.058" offset="3140963">The record is not clear on what they knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.235" offset="3149740">This was a rural area where a lot of the people knew one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.492" offset="3170743">The record is not clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.085" offset="3177117">It does indicate that one of the officers had observed her living there prior to the day of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.386" offset="3218286">But it does not indicate whether he knew that she was a daughter of the Marshalls.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.802" offset="3239915">This later became apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.829" offset="3276069">Now, since there was no finding of official misconduct of any kind, it is difficult to see what function and exclusionary rule would perform in a situation on this sort, which I think means primarily that there is no reason to hold that there was a Fourth Amendment violation since the officers conducted a reasonable search.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.838" offset="3400098">But we contend also that it means even if the Court should hold that there was something technically wrong with the search under the Fourth Amendment that the exclusionary rule should not be applied to these factual circumstances since the officers acted in a responsible, reasonable way and presumably would act in the same way if the facts were to arise again.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.307" offset="3517962">Now, the courts below seemed to believe that consent searches should be treated differently with respect to what this Court has held that the conduct of the officers and the circumstances as they find it should be the touchstone.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.735" offset="3607719">They formulated the situation of a consent search as really involving an agency question or a question of the authority of one person to wave the constitutional the rights of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.036" offset="3672921">We don't believe that this is the accurate formulation of what's involved here and indeed, two recent opinions of this Court have indicated that the question is not a question of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.771" offset="3719837">I'm referring to the opinion Shneckloth against Bustamonte and also the opinion in Coolidge against New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.541" offset="3758916">Instead, it is really a question of the joint occupant's own right to authorize a search of the premises where she lives as indicated in the Court's holding in Frazier against Cupp with respect to a jointly used duffel bag which one of the users gave the police permission to search.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.212" offset="6325603">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.398" offset="6338351">I have somewhat of an advantage over Mr. Wallace and that I was at all of the proceedings including in the Court of Appeals, and I might just say for openers that when Mr. Matlock or somebody because we don't know who yet that legibly robbed the Bank of Wyocena, they did get all of their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.141" offset="6413270">I think the Government is wrong in many respects and I must start by saying that we do have in this case a test of Judge Doyle, namely, it's a two-pronged test--a test of apparent authority as well as the magic words that the Court of Appeals used and that Judge Doyle used, namely actual authority to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.141" offset="6509296">Now, the Government leaves out a couple of very, very important things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.522" offset="6526851">And the first question, and that question was asked in the Court of Appeals, why no search warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.000" offset="6552764">That's the most important thing that I can think of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.973" offset="6564676">That goes to the heart of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.265" offset="6577842">The officers admitted they were in no danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.186" offset="6589544">All of the testimony from every officer I specifically asked, were you in danger of your life?</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.398" offset="6614309">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.673" offset="6619429">Where was the defendant at this time?</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.593" offset="6631131">He was handcuffed in the car, in front of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.947" offset="6648581">Now, the facts in regard of that, I believe are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.452" offset="6662583">The defendant was arrested outside of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.956" offset="6676584">He either went out to walk the dogs but anyway, he was outside when the Columbia County Sheriff's Department came upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.284" offset="6705842">They put him in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.514" offset="6714828">They admitted at that time that they had no knowledge that any fruits of any alleged crime were in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.842" offset="6744085">They never asked the defendant his permission to search the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.577" offset="6767073">They never asked him if he was a tenant in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.869" offset="6780238">They never asked him whether or not he paid rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.427" offset="6794449">All they did was put him in the car and knocked on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.303" offset="6809913">Now, there's a conflict in testimony as to whether or not they did in fact knocked on the door or whether or not they in affect burst in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.489" offset="6846694">The Court, both the lower court and the Court of Appeals did find that Gayle Graff, the paramour, the mistress or whatever you want to call her, in fact, gave consent to the police officers coming in.</text>
