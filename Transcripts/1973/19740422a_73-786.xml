            <text syncTime="1733.617" offset="7011265">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.722" offset="7031641">Gillian and Douglas are now all over ten years old since their decision, the principle that fundamental in due process and equal protection is that in trial in all appeal, an indigent defendant must have counsel appointment for him if he cannot afford it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.956" offset="7132578">And that principle has been expanded or further delineated to hold that the right is not diluted by the nature of the offense so long as imprisonment is threatened or by the age of the defendant versus in juvenile cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.629" offset="7207288">Mr. Safron pointed out the right attaches at the beginning or at the issuance of formal adversary proceedings usually by indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.645" offset="7255353">Now, the question in which we have before us today is whether or not after the right accrues and further along in the adversary process whether or not the right the measure diminishes or disappears or we put another way whether or not the right attaches according to the nature of the Court or how far long the adversary process the Court might happened to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.018" offset="7372800">In 1969, the Tenth and the Seventh Circuit decide that indeed the right to counsel stopped after the first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.373" offset="7410207">The Courts there limiting their decision to the facts in Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.770" offset="7431837">More recently however the Fourth Circuit and now the Sixth Circuit find that the right does continue on throughout the adversary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.941" offset="7472483">This court is already familiar with the background of the case (Inaudible) in this particular Court and the Mecklenburg case, the defendant received a letter from his attorney stating that after his first appeal that he had approached the Superior Court, the Court in our State, and have been informed that he no longer could represent him because there was no longer the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.643" offset="7591288">Thereupon the right to counsel in that particular case seized and the Guilford County case, the public defender in that County representing the defendant and carried it through the discretionary review in the North Carolina Supreme Court but did not carry it to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.202" offset="7661505">What we have before us today perhaps is very defined and what we do not have before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.916" offset="7692434">We are not deciding or this Court does not want to decide or have to decide whether right to counsel exists before or after the adversary process begins or ends.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.222" offset="7861603">It's an attack, in fact civil in nature as viewed by the Courts and the defendant's attack upon his conviction rather than the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.737" offset="7891696">He is defending and when I term the adversary procedures on direct review but federal habeas corpus I think is a little bit different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.009" offset="12624771">In my representation, I did not reach the question of our state statute which I did say was in the state of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.194" offset="12673567">Our general assembly just adjourned last week and in the dying hours of the 1974 general assembly they pass a bill amending the provision which Mr. Anderson spoke to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.505" offset="12770743">That particular provision now reads review of any judgment or decree pursuant to GS78-27 that is direct review to the Court of Appeals or direct review to Supreme Court in applicable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.247" offset="12837721">GS78-30-1 that is the substantial constitutional questions from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court, GS78-30(2) that is the dissent case and GS15-222 that is the petition for writ of certiorari in post conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.545" offset="12922880">So, the language which was causing the trouble and which the justices or the judges or Superior Court had difficulty in applying has been rewritten and our statute now reads that the right to counsel in these instances is counsel to the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals when it is as of right and in post conviction matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.803" offset="13039909">So it’s a clear cut constitutional question without any state statute being involved.</text>
