            <text syncTime="21.253" offset="161750">In Shea against Vialpando, we have a case that's here from Certiorari, from the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.871" offset="208248">The provisions of the Social Security Act providing aid to families with dependent children are administered by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.028" offset="252865">Section 402 (a) (7) of the Act requires that the states take into consideration any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.107" offset="309185">Such expenses are deducted from an applicant's income in determining eligibility for assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.310" offset="341995">A Colorado State regulation adopted in 1970, established a flat uniform allowance for work related expenses of $30 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.587" offset="399047">Respondent's expenses substantially exceeded this $30, making her ineligible for continued assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.774" offset="435827">She brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.717" offset="459651">We hold that the Colorado regulation, imposing what in effect is an arbitrary ceiling on work related expenses, conflicts with Section 402 (a) (7), and therefore, is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.694" offset="523494">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Tenth Circuit.</text>
