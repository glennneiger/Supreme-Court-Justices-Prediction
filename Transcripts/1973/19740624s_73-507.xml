            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">In Hamling versus the United States, the petitioners were convicted of mailing and conspiring to mail an obscene advertising brochure with sexually explicit photographic material relating to their illustrated version of an official report on obscenity in violation of provisions of the United States Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.213" offset="177633">The indictment under Section 1461 charged petitioners in the language of the statute which prohibits the act whoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing of anything declared by this Section to be non-mailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.427" offset="238446">The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the counts charging the mailing of the allegedly obscene Illustrated Report itself, but it did find petitioners guilty of violations of statute in circulating the brochure through the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.390" offset="298318">Following affirmance of the convictions by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, this Court decided Miller versus California last June and in the companion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.767" offset="339801">The Court of Appeals thereafter denied a petition for rehearing based on its consideration of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.930" offset="364460">We granted petitioner's petition for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.352" offset="382119">Petitioners challenge their convictions based upon the pre-Miller obscenity test in Memoirs versus Massachusetts and also because they claim it fails to meet the standards laid down in the Miller cases last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.984" offset="440633">They also challenge various procedural and evidentiary rulings of the District Court and certain of its instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.609" offset="467174">In a 50-page opinion filed today which I will only summarize, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.113" offset="497162">We hold first that 1461 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to petitioner's pre-Miller conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.648" offset="527360">The jury's determination that the brochure was obscene was supported by the evidence and was consistent with the Memoirs obscenity formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.113" offset="561215">In addition, we hold that the standards of obscenity established in the Miller cases are to be applied to petitioner's pre-Miller conduct, that in applying these standards, we hold they do not require the reversal of petitioner's convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.741" offset="619729">We similarly reject petitioner's contentions directed at various procedural and evidentiary rulings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.510" offset="654838">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.655" offset="667376">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall joined.</text>
