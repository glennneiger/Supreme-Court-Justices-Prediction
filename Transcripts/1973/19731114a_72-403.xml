            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="27.127" offset="185260">Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the court?</text>
            <text syncTime="30.824" offset="199993">The issue here was whether in a case involving a routine termination action against the federal probationary employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.277" offset="237819">Federal district court may enjoin the termination pending that employee's appeal to the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.497" offset="266762">The facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.585" offset="279092">In January 1971, respondent was hired as a program analyst in the general services administration and a salary of about $18,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.897" offset="324336">Four months later, one of her immediate supervisors sent to his supervisor, Mr. Sanders, a memorandum recommending that her employment be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.816" offset="376059">His recommendation set forth a variety of reasons why her work performance was considered to be unsatisfactory and that among these were her failure to follow the instructions of her supervisor, follow office direction generally and her inability to get along with her fellow employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.771" offset="455784">The memorandum went on however to state that she had experienced difficulties with her previous employer, the Defense Intelligence Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.465" offset="494655">After studying this recommendation Mr. Sanders issued to the respondent a notice terminating her employment effective to next week, the termination notice stated expressly that the reasons for her termination or for failure to abide by office of procedure and to accept the direction of her supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.338" offset="586083">On receiving this termination notice the respondent filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission and lodged a complaint in the United States District Court to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.844" offset="632163">In her complaint in the court, she alleged or she asked for injunctive relief pending the appeal to the Civil Service Commission and she alleged that if an injunction would not issue permitting her to stay at employment, she would lose income for the interim period and unrebutted charges against her would remain in her personal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.285" offset="717845">The District Court immediately granted the temporary restraining order against her termination and set a hearing for the following week on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.309" offset="750028">For describing the events of that hearing it is helpful to first summarize briefly the Civil Service regulations pertaining to federal probationary employees so that the grounds for appeal in Civil Service Commission can be better understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.668" offset="811468">Under the Lloyd-LaFollette Act permanent employees in the competitive service, that is, employees who have finished their one year probationary term maybe discharged only for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.669" offset="859429">But the Act does not provider similar protections for probationary employees, during her first year of service under the Act such employees maybe terminated at will, under the regulations however, Civil Service Commission certain rights are granted to probationary employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.510" offset="934766">Among these are the rights not to be terminated because of invidious class based discrimination, marital status, political activities or improper discrimination because of physical disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.046" offset="988891">In addition although a probationary employee maybe terminated upon the discovery of pre-employment misconduct, termination on that ground does invoke under the Civil Service regulations, certain procedural protections, the employee must be informed of the charges of pre-employment misconduct against him and he must be given an opportunity to respond to those charges in writing before the termination becomes effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.519" offset="1102785">Thus when the respondent appealed to the Civil Service Commission, her claim was that not withstanding the fact that the termination notice recited only her poor work performance, she alleged that the fact that she was being terminated for pre-employment misconduct that is, events that took place at the Defense Intelligence Agency in her previous job.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.166" offset="1197453">If she prevailed upon that appeal to the Civil Service Commission, she would be reinstated with back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.889" offset="1232353">However, at that time upon her reinstatement her employer would remain free under the Civil Service regulations to go forward with termination proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.721" offset="1275611">All that GSA would have to do at that time would be to inform her in writing as to the charges pre-employment misconduct, if any, made against her and permit her an opportunity to respond to those charges before she was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.059" offset="1336947">In other words the respondent had no right to retain her employment under the constitution or under any statute or even under the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.613" offset="1375190">All she had was a right to certain procedural regularities.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.822" offset="1404029">I return now to the hearing which was held before the District Court on her motion for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.386" offset="1434331">At that time government filed a motion to dismiss one of equity jurisdiction; this motion was not active upon by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.139" offset="1477277">Instead the court proceeded to consider the merits of respondent’s requests for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.374" offset="1502250">District Court did not determine whether respondent had either alleged or shown that she was in danger of irreparable injury of the injunction would not issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.136" offset="1545300">Instead the District Court first took up the question whether respondent would be likely to show before the Civil Service Commission that she in fact was being fired for pre-employment misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.846" offset="1596082">That was an issue which would be tried by the commission on the basis of written submissions only.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.564" offset="1623040">However, the District Court was not content to review the case on the basis of written submissions or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.095" offset="1653133">Instead he requested that Mr. Sanders the GSA official who had ordered respondents termination, come to the court and testify as to his reasons for terminating or informing respondent that her employment was to be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.352" offset="1722201">Mr. Sanders at that time was on vacation in California and he was not available to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.085" offset="1745084">Therefore the District Court continued to temporary restraining order until he should appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.228" offset="1769639">The government appealed from that order to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit and that court affirmed cases now here on the government’s petition for certiorari which the respondent did not oppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.934" offset="1820526">In the meantime the respondents appeal to the Civil Service Commission has been held pending the outcome of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.229" offset="1853649">I turn now to the legal issues involved here; our principal contention is that the general statutory and administrative scheme governing federal employment precludes the exercise of equitable jurisdiction in cases such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.758" offset="1919791">This scheme which I will describe in a moment must be understood in its decisional context.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.959" offset="1944555">Under the decisions of this court a federal employee in the absence of any protective legislation or regulations has no right at all to employment, his employment maybe terminated at will, following this general rule the court expressly held in White against Berry which we cited on brief, that the federal courts have no general equity jurisdiction to enjoin a discharge of a probationary or of a federal employee rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.717" offset="2071615">That case involved a discharge which allegedly was in conflict with the pertinent Civil Service regulations at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.539" offset="2110903">In short White against Berry involves essentially the identical issue here and this court could not affirm that overruling of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.898" offset="2152385">In any event, that decisional background, Congress in 1912 decided to extend certain additional protections to certain federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.592" offset="2199092">It enacted the Lloyd-LaFollette Act which as I have previously stated, affords to non-probationary employees in the competitive service.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.440" offset="2238485">The protection that they maybe discharged only for cause subsequent enactment and promulgated regulations established for such employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.212" offset="2281639">The elaborate appeal procedures which are now before this Court in Arnett against Kennedy which was argued last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.165" offset="2309433">However, in enacting Lloyd-LaFollette Act Congress determined there should be a one year probationary term during which the employee would not be afforded such procedures, could be terminated without a for cause determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.510" offset="2514756">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that there was such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.427" offset="2530429">That case of course took place before the enactment of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act but in 1883 Congress had established the Civil Service Commission and the commission had promulgated certain regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.296" offset="2577972">And I think the claim in White against Berry was that the dismissal was in violation of one of those regulations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="637.645" offset="2627291">It’s my understanding that she is Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.183" offset="2645473">A central feature of the scheme however which applies to both probationary and non-probationary employees like is that termination becomes effective prior to appeal to the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.720" offset="2699598">The employees have certain rights of appeal as to probationary employees such rights are limited and nevertheless there is no statutory or regulatory provision for them to remain in their employment pending the appeal with Civil Service Commission.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="670.682" offset="2759471">I understand that Mr. Jones, the government's position is that there is no equity jurisdiction at all in this kind of a case because there is a fully adequate remedy at law in terms of reinstating the employee and giving back pay with interests and perhaps costs if the termination for any reason is determined to have been improper.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="695.636" stopTime="892.090">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="695.636" offset="2859259">That’s correct, that involves the back pay Act, Mr. Chief Justice to which I was just coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.195" offset="2885486">Prior to the enactment of the Back Pay Act there was an unfortunate gap governing legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.181" offset="2913489">If an employee was terminated and it was subsequently determined that, that termination was unlawful and the employee was reinstated nevertheless the employee would have lost pay during the time of the appeal to the Civil Service Commission and there was no mechanism for the provision of such back pay and this of course was a problem which was aggravated by the fact that the courts would not grant interim equitable relief because following this courts decision in White against Berry that kind of relief was deemed unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.821" offset="3048072">Now confronted with this dilemma Congress could have done any combination of three things, it could have provided Civil Service Commission with authority to grant back pay upon reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.696" offset="3099481">It could have granted the Civil Service Commission, the power to stay a termination, pending appeal before the commission in appropriate cases or could have explicitly granted to the courts the power to provide the kind of interim equitable relief that the District Court here thought that it could provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.769" offset="3175863">The Congress chose only to do the first of these three things, only to provide the Civil Service Commission with a power to award back pay upon reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.602" offset="3219122">This we believe was a deliberate policy choice which was intended to accommodate the respective interests of both the employees and their employing agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.623" offset="3259246">Under the Back Pay Act, if the employee's discharge was unlawful, he is fully compensated upon reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.815" offset="3292056">On the other hand under the Act he has no right to remain in employment pending hearing of his appeal by the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.966" offset="3324656">We believe that the exercise of equitable jurisdiction which the District Court here engaged in is disruptive of the balance which Congress was seeking to achieve between the federal employees and the interest of the government in an efficient Civil Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.497" offset="3406785">The retention of a discharged employee, an employee who has received his termination notice, pending review before the commission which could take as long as six months in some cases would be bad for morale of the agency and bad for discipline with that particular department where she was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.063" offset="3485048">And if the termination had any basis, that is, if in fact it was for poor performance, then it would be bad for the efficiency of the employing agency as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.418" offset="3530397">The citizens of this country rely upon government to provide a wide array of necessary services from national defense to social welfare and the ability of the government to provide these services quickly and efficiently shouldn’t be interfered with or hampered by the forced retention of an employee found by his supervisors to be incompetent or unwilling to follow direction or for some other reason unqualified for further service.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.972" offset="3724643">The court did not restrict itself to any particular class of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.694" offset="3747527">I suppose this would apply to permanent employees as well as probationary employees and it will apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.594" offset="3767171">Well, if it applies to probationary then there is a fortiori that would apply to permanent employees with their greater degree of protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.674" offset="3867481">So that in the future case the court might decide not to apply that rule in a special case, there is nothing in the courts language itself which was so --</text>

            <text syncTime="978.637" offset="3991301">You are relying on the proposition that no equitable remedy is available if there is remedy at law in terms of backpay and reinstatement?</text>

            <text syncTime="989.995" offset="4036754">I suppose in essence that’s our argument that the remedy, the Congress has in fact provided a general remedy at law available to all federal employees and therefore there should not be a case by case determination of the matter of adequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.481" offset="4106658">Now I think it’s important to realize that the interest of the employee do not outweigh the cost to the public, if the employee succeeds upon his appeal to the commission then interim injunctive relief would have provided him with absolutely nothing because he is reinstated with back pay anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.319" offset="4190041">On the other hand if he does not prevail on his appeal to the Civil Service Commission, interim injunctive relief would have simply unjustly enriched him at the expense of the tax payers, at the expense of the efficiency of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.955" offset="4244584">We believe that interim injunctive relief here not only disturbs the balance that Congress meant to achieve between the federal employees on the one hand and the needs of the government on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.425" offset="4290456">That would also offend the values further by the exhaustion doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.436" offset="4310518">The Congress has left to the Civil Service Commission the responsibility for determining in first instance, employee rights subject only to subsequent judicial review, and as this Court noted in Arrow Transportation and Wichita Board of Trade cases, a preliminary court ruling on the merits pending decision by the administrative agency can be disruptive of that agency's primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.898" offset="4412291">Now, we believe that would be especially true in a case such as this where the court undertakes the scope of review which itself is far broader than that which would be assumed by the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.200" offset="4461505">Here the court was granting a full evidentiary hearing where its fourth commission that would merely be a decision upon written evidence in that affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.730" offset="4511660">Respondent in her brief, I think essentially ignores the policy considerations that we have stated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.166" offset="4553456">She relies primarily or almost entirely for equitable relief upon the All Writs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.710" offset="4587624">It seems clear to us that, that Act must be read in light of the pertinent statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.814" offset="4620016">The Act itself requires the issuance of writs to be “agreeable to the usages and principles of law”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.166" offset="4653453">And this court in Arrow Transportation and other cases has held at a federal court’s equitable powers under the act if granted can be implicitly withdrawn by the pertinent statutory scheme, that is, can be withdrawn by the necessary implication of the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.447" offset="4730567">In Arrow Transportation there was nothing in the Interstate Commerce Act which would have expressly taken away from the District Courts the equitable relief they sought there to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.092" offset="4793156">Nevertheless, the general administrative scheme was such this court viewed equitable relief in those circumstances to be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.708" offset="4827533">We believe a similar result is required here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.364" offset="4846237">But we would contend further that the All Writs Act does not properly extend to the kind of interim relief respondent seeks here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.236" offset="4885734">That Act simply provides that the federal courts, “may issue all rates necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions”'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.423" offset="4930456">This court has never read that Act as providing a broad power to grant pre-exhaustion relief in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.643" offset="4963370">This court has permitted pre-exhaustion relief of the kind respondent seeks only in cases where it is necessary to ride a constitutional wrong or to preserve the jurisdiction of the court upon subsequent review, that is, preserve the possibility of effective judicial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.941" offset="5036513">In the context of this case, I think that a reading of the All Writs Act which is so limited and the respondent concedes in our brief that the All Writs Act is so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.933" offset="5088444">I think that critically disposes off this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.438" offset="5102550">Courts below did not rely upon their power to preserve jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.188" offset="5121463">They didn't discuss that issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.961" offset="5132643">They instead asserted a broad power to provide pre-exhaustion relief, whenever, wherever they thought it necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.715" offset="5167647">Court of Appeals explicitly saw its role as that of breathing life into the Civil Service Regulations, that is, of giving pre-exhaustion equitable enforcement to regulatory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.114" offset="5217176">Whenever the likelihood, even a preliminary denial, not a permanent denial but even a preliminary denial of those rights have been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.581" offset="5251030">We believe that the All Writs Act is not conferred such a broad power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.657" offset="5271406">Our respondent seeks to defend the decision below finally, on a ground that interim injunctive relief here pending exhaustion for administrative remedies may have been necessary to preserve jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.489" offset="5318740">Respondent however does not suggest how in this kind of case, interim injunctive relief could be relevant to the subsequent social jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.415" offset="5358446">The immediate discharge of the respondent from the GSA, would in no way limit District court's reviewing authority over the subsequent appeal from the Civil Service Commission determination, nor would it prevent the court from providing the kind of relief and the only kind of relief which Congress has made available here, reinstatement with back pay.</text>
