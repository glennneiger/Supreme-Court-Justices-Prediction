            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ll hear arguments next in 73-1265, the Saxbe against the Washington Post.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="45.295" offset="257881">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.087" offset="269061">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.628" offset="287242">The respondents, the Washington Post Company and a reporter Ben Bagdikian, brought this action in the District Court for the District of Columbia challenging as a violation of the First Amendment, the Federal Bureau of Prisons Policy prohibiting members of the press from obtaining personal interviews with pre-selected inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.504" offset="358713">Petitioners here, the Attorney General, and Mr. Carlson, the Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons were defendants below.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.027" offset="388807">In the courts below, the plaintiffs-respondents complaint sought by way of declaratory judgment an injunctive relief to gain access to any and all inmates in the Federal Prison System.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.929" offset="440424">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals however gave more limited relief in which the presumption appears to be according to the relief granted that press interviews will be allowed unless there are serious administrative or disciplinary problems likely to be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.046" offset="500924">In other word, the District Court was -- they say affirmed with slight modification by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.132" offset="525270">The position to the parties I think have shifted slightly in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.164" offset="537391">Respondents now adopt and defend the decision of the Court of Appeals, and I have informed this Court and we’ll mention again that the Bureau of Prisons will soon promulgate a new policy, which prohibits interviews, pre-selected inmates, only in those institutions where the Bureau deems it essential that is maximum and medium security institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.826" offset="624013">All other institutions, prison farms, halfway houses, youth and juvenile institutions for example will permit press interviews under reasonable regulations as to time and place.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.325" offset="670093">This policy now correlates the rule about interviews with the Director’s judgment about which institutions are at tension-filled and which institutions that policy is necessary.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="169.775" offset="755879">This case comes down now therefore I think simply to the question of the Bureau’s power to maintain a no interview rule in maximum security and medium security facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.932" offset="796526">Those are facilities with strong perimeter guards, walls, double fences, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.377" offset="822230">I think it’s important to be quite clear about what this case involves and what this case does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.765" offset="847830">And I think I have to say that I believe that the First Amendment claim here is not at the core of First Amendment because I think they are relatively attenuated First Amendment claim, and I say that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.775" offset="891820">One, it does not involve any inhibition on the right to publish.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.354" offset="910211">This is a claim of a right of access to news-worthy information which I think is not at the core of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.917" offset="940408">And secondly, we have the claim made in a prison context which is a regulated context, in which many constitutional rights vary because of the nature of the context, and in which primary discretion is entrusted to the Director of Bureau of Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.800" offset="1011984">What this case does involve is a restriction on one of many modes of access to news.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.846" offset="1040091">It is not enough to argue I think as respondents do, that they could do a more effective job of reporting if this mode of access were also available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.492" offset="1078753">As I have said the core of First Amendment’s guarantee is the freedom to publish.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.165" offset="1101427">The amendment’s application to rights of access is ancillary to the freedom to publish.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.933" offset="1120444">And as the Branzburg opinion reminds us, rights of access may be limited by Government for reasons which would not give Government the power or the right to limit publication. The Branzburg opinion gives examples of that, I think Zemel against Rusk, Kleindienst against Mandel are other instances where access may be denied lawfully although publication could not lawfully be prevented.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.800" offset="1223993">That’s frequent in Governmental life I think it’s properly so surely a judge could tell his law clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.289" offset="1241861">But they may not give interviews to the press about pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.593" offset="1255131">And I assume they could discharge a clerk who did even though he might not be able to enjoin the publication if the information was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.637" offset="1287314">Now in this case, the press has so many sources of information and the minor restrictions placed on this one journalistic technique is so vital of prison administration that I find it difficult to think there is a valid First Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.598" offset="1359099">I would think, I would urge that the proper method of review is to ask whether the Director of the Bureau of Prisons has adopted a regulation which lies within the zone of reasonableness which accommodates the competing policies in a manner that can be said to be rational and to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.596" offset="1443109">Because any other mode of review will involve courts in effect in second guessing the administrative decisions of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons in detail in the guides of constitutional adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.671" offset="1503399">It will also prevent the evolution of prison policy and for policy in these matters or the matter does evolve in the Federal Bureau of Prison system.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.219" offset="1745607">We are in the field of federal regulation that Mr. Justice Douglas and I think, Congress would not need to legislate under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.355" offset="1770162">It could just regulate the prisons as it see is fit, and if it wishes to do so of course may implement First Amendment values although it need not use the First Amendment as a source of legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.380" offset="1822302">These are the Federal Institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.500" offset="1838707">But recalling that this is a regulated context where regulation of Constitutional rights is permissible, and I think that the zone of reasonableness is the proper standard to judge the Director of the Bureau of Prisons standards, I think we might examine the actual claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.007" offset="1924807">Respondents and varies amici pitch this case on the press’ need to learn about prison conditions, and the allegation is prison conditions require reform and if the press can’t tell us about them we won’t know about them and won’t reform them.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.303" offset="1997949">I would suggest that there’s almost nothing about prison conditions certainly nothing about general conditions, but the press cannot now learn with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.294" offset="2033894">I would like just to run through the sources of information available to the press now about prison conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.865" offset="2396160">That’s a process that’s going forward I would hate to see it set in contrary all of the sudden by constitutional rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.969" offset="2424581">A concept of a zone of reasonableness gives the system a little elbow room, a little play in the joints.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.841" offset="2496157">It is encouraged to tour the prisons and inspect any office, any and all facilities and equipment, and programs; and on such a tour there is no part of a prison that is close to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.778" offset="2535863">They may go into the segregated facilities and they may converse with prisoners in segregation, as well as, with any other inmates they dropped into.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.856" offset="2568150">In fact, Mr. Bagdikian was offered an opportunity to do precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.737" offset="2587690">The inmates at a prison who had led us right we’re in segregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.643" offset="2659370">Fourth, members of the press may obtain interviews with groups of prisoners who are randomly selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.108" offset="2685179">Mr. Bagdikian was given such an interview with no prison officials present.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.575" offset="2711092">Now, members of the press of course may also interview any visitors who have been to see an inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.265" offset="2733767">His lawyer, his family, his attorney, all of these persons may talk to the inmate in complete confidence and may then talk to the reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.999" offset="2768771">And sixth, I think if we’re talking about general prison condition, it ought to be noted that members of the press may of course freely interview all of the inmates who are being released from prison, and that’s a constant flow of men at any one time, I think its approximately half of the entire federal prison population will be out within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.915" offset="2848392">At Leavenworth for example, during fiscal 1973, 415 men were released which is an average of 34-35 men a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.007" offset="2888725">Now, most of those men are processed out from prison farms or halfway houses, but they under this new policy can be reached as soon as they leave Leavenworth and get into the halfway house or the prison farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.819" offset="2928013">So, we have a constant flow of inmates who can tell you immediately about the conditions they just left behind aside from the correspondence, the tours, and everything else was provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.917" offset="2960405">Although there are six channels of information that give the press, I think complete ability to learn what they want to know about prison conditions accurately and promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.392" offset="2994364">Respondents’ brief refers to these rules as a dam against information.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.713" offset="3011605">I think this general rules, views and context, act more like a sieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.997" offset="3028741">Information comes out freely and easily and the only kind of journalistic technique, which is forbidden, is the one that raises severe problems for discipline and for rehabilitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.637" offset="3087256">Respondents concede they may be properly denied interviews during times of riot or heighten tension in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.953" offset="3116513">So, what is really left in the First Amendment claim is the right to pre-select an inmate for a confidential interview when there isn’t riot or tension in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.331" offset="3162070">And in fact, does that usually mean the right to interview a celebrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.765" offset="3175758">Interview a Jimmy Hoffa, Phillip Berrigan, or to interview a disruptive inmate who has just made the news because he’s lead a work stoppage or a riot.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.817" offset="3215987">And it is the latter of course is particularly troublesome because that man becomes a leader by leading a trouble and then by broadcasting his inflammatory charges direct to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.194" offset="3265515">And hardly enough, the very rule of respondents are arguing for would cut-off access to that man as soon he did it, because he would become the disruptive figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.263" offset="3305848">So, I think the rule you are asking for is really not a rule that makes a great deal of sense from anybody’s worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.449" offset="3334583">It ought to be said that it is very odd to claim this kind of right of access in the prison context.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.546" offset="3366975">The maximum and medium security prisons constitute the most tensed, volatile, violence-prone society I suppose on the face of the earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.066" offset="3408980">The Bureau of Prison simply cannot maintain discipline and effect rehabilitation, which they have done with increasing effect of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.991" offset="3440744">If press interviews are permitted to create or maintain disruptive inmate leaders, that much is conceded by the courts are blown and apparently by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.835" offset="3476062">But they think a case-by-case approach will cure it, I don’t think so I think it would damage rehabilitation or harm discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.561" offset="3510962">In the first place, there is inherent discrimination between inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.972" offset="3528620">The man who is disruptive who they alienated who is hostile will not be allowed to have interviews, while man who says more pleasant things will be not because the warden is trying to control contents but you do get a control of content when you say the disruptive hostile alienated man cannot speak to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.727" offset="3607615">And you also get tension and unhappiness as between prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.053" offset="3633006">Furthermore, wardens are going to be required to guess under this new policy about who is likely to be dangerous.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.531" offset="3678877">It suggests they have to have some past experience with this man to believe that he is disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.761" offset="3695804">Well, they may have a subjective feeling that he is disruptive and he may be quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.102" offset="3713149">But they are going to be required to guess, sometimes they are going to guess wrong, and you may have seriously harmful even tragic results.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.072" offset="3745019">And I would add this, even if a notorious inmate proves not disruptive within the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.395" offset="3770305">It seems to me that constant press attention which could not be denied then if he was not disruptive is totally inconsistent with the idea of an opportunity for penitence and for rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.598" offset="3827148">A man who is -- becomes the object of the press and his opinions are cited everywhere is not likely to repent.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.042" offset="3976882">I will say one last word.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.856" offset="3988167">I think the First Amendment itself cuts against this case-by-case policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.852" offset="4012199">If the press has full access to the prisons, we are going to have to decide, who is the press?</text>
            <text syncTime="988.762" offset="4031843">Now, respondent say, you’ve already done that, you have a definition of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.165" offset="4045427">That was a definition adopted as a matter of administrative discretion about constitutional pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.305" offset="4066011">Once it is stated that the definition is controlled by the constitution then we have a government official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.980" offset="4092656">In the first instance a warden of a penitentiary deciding who qualifies as the press and who does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.235" offset="4117734">That becomes something like an official licensing policy if made under the First Amendment, and I think that’s a concept, its an (Inaudible) to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.797" offset="4155977">We submit in short that the considerations of the First Amendment, consideration to the prison context, considerations of the deference due to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons suggest that the case be reversed, and that the Director be allowed to go forward under the policy statement is promulgated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.490" offset="4734746">We do have in this record, the fact that 19 of the 24 American Jurisdictions whose regulations -- who have regulations that are introduced in the record, or may be the press interviews on a virtually without exception, or on a discretionary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.428" offset="4798485">And we now have a situation in which the warden, at least that the lesser secure prisons of the Federal Government will have to make discretionary judgments because presumably in times of emergency, or in times of particular individual disciplinary problems they will not permit a particular interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.528" offset="4894824">That change in policy, I believes -- believe makes relevant to the Bureau of Prison’s policy with respect to the way man are assigned to the various prisons of the Bureau of Prisons, and that is their policy statement 7300.13 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.022" offset="4972878">I would simply note for this Court that of the many, many reasons listed as to why individuals are assigned only one or two of them deal with security problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.101" offset="5969189">The District Court would then decide, I would simply note that in all the cases cited by the Solicitor General by us, in our case, and the other case that this Court heard prior to ours, that all the litigation deals with the total ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.510" offset="6022792">That with one exception, there is not a single case that I am aware of that deals with any of the 19 jurisdictions that were introduced in the record of the 29 jurisdictions in fact that have discretionary policies, or generally admit the permit interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.534" offset="6094890">So, what I think that the litigation point is not a point of serious concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.978" offset="6128640">I would note that in the context of our record and the evidence it was submitted on the findings of the court below, all virtually, all of the evidence deals with maximum and minimum security prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.690" offset="6195513">Those are the wardens who testified, those are the wardens who testified on our behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.371" offset="6218188">We submit that it is our point that under Branzburg and Hayes, the news gathering was firmly hitched to the First Amendment by all nine justices and by all opinions in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.226" offset="6281613">And that in that case, the court applied to news gathering, the same kinds of tests that is was applied to the right to publish and other protections guaranteed by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.632" offset="6327275">Namely that the infringement of the protective First Amendment rights must be no broader than necessary to perceive, to achieve a permissible governmental purpose, and secondly, that a state’s interest must be compelling or paramount to justify even an indirect burden on First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.372" offset="6402194">And we think that the -- in this case, in which the Government had two hearings, two opportunities to present evidence that they clearly did not establish that kind of a governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.697" offset="6455484">We also believe as the Court of Appeals and the District Court found that the record provides substantial evidence, and uncontroverted testimony that face-to-face personal interviews are not simply another technique, but that they are essential to effective news gathering in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.013" offset="6532807">The Bureau of Prisons’ method of permitting an exchange of letters with the prisoner’s letters to the reporter not examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.427" offset="6566452">But to reporters’ letter to the prisoner examined for contraband and for content, which would incite a legal conduct is patently inadequate as far as the press is concerned, and if we think as far as First Amendment values are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.619" offset="6623190">The reporter has no opportunity to test the credibility of the prisoner or to follow up in his questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.443" offset="6650567">Indeed, he does not have the assurance that the prisoner who is signing the signature block at that letter is the prisoner who is answering the questions he is writing to him about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.153" offset="6697378">We all know that in prison life, one prisoner writes for another, one prisoner answers and helps other prisoners answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.881" offset="6732278">And I would note that such a policy makes an assumption that prisoners and inmates can read and write clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.736" offset="6763729">And as the Chief Justice has noted the percentage of inmates in all institutions who cannot read or write is staggering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.901" offset="6796330">We think the public interest in learning about prisons weighs heavily on the First Amendment scales, and they are with simply note that with there are more than 1.5 million Americans in prison in this nation on any given day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.607" offset="6943138">We think Your Honor that the public, the fact that this are public institutions that the taxpayers of this country are paying for them that they are a significant part of our Government is a weight in the scale of the right of the public to know about what’s going on in our prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.896" offset="7012310">We think that the right of the press here is essentially their right, as surrogates of the public to inform the public, and that that should weigh in the scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.523" offset="7070824">We believe that the record in this case, which I said, puts as in the position of not having to speculate does not justify a Government sweeping ban of the kind that here exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.746" offset="7123696">I mentioned the Warden Aldrich’s comments about Terra Haute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.934" offset="7144490">I would mentioned that all warden directors who testified on the issue of “big wheels”, wardens Aldrich and Directors Wainwright and Bensinger, in the court below all testified that “big wheels” come in to prison “big wheels” or become “big wheels” in prison whether or not they are interviewed that what is involved here is a kind of negative leadership function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.547" offset="7238949">They also noted that the prison officials are easily able to identify the disruptive prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.294" offset="7261936">Particularly in the Federal Prison system for the reasons that are mentioned by the Chief Justice in the context of the testing that now is on the more sophisticated psychological and aptitude testing, that now goes on in prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.253" offset="7317734">We do not think that there is any significant evidence in this record which indicates that press interviews creates disturbances at prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.386" offset="7366322">There were three items of testimony in this area, in this case and one related to the warden or the head of the State Correctional System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.334" offset="7414073">In Iowa, Mr. Brewer, he testified that during a period of tension, he was overruled by the governor who ordered him to permit press interviews and that these increase the tension in this institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.978" offset="7468617">There were still no violence at that institution, I might note, and moreover, Iowa still has a discretionary interview policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.636" offset="7515324">In the other -- the other instance mentioned was in the State of Florida in which a warden from the State of Florida said that some articles that were written created tension in Florida four months later where there was violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.627" offset="7575301">I think the causation when this Court looks at the record, the causation is highly tenuous, and the warden admitted that there were severe racial tension problems in his prison before any press interviews or articles actually were written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.354" offset="7650116">In the context of the questions that have been raised by this court, I think in the context and attempt to define the press, I do not consider that a difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.600" offset="7703197">The press is defined in many, many ways and if the Solicitor General is concerned about how the press is defined, he should be concerned about the fact that it’s defined by every department of this Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.860" offset="7748232">Everyday, the Justice Department has regulations defining what the press is, who is entitled to use their press facilities, who is entitled to go in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.460" offset="7782609">There are press definitions here and this is not proposed in the Bureau of Prisons, which are in existence in the Bureau of Prisons policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.901" offset="7816359">This is not a situation like Branzburg where we have an inherently unlimited number of people that might claim to be reporters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.172" offset="7853453">In the Branzburg case, any individual at any given point of time might claim to be a reporter, claim to be entitled of the First Amendment rights, and therefore create a problem in terms of investigation by the Grand Jury where it witness a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.943" offset="7912490">We don’t have that situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.499" offset="7922730">In this case, there is a recognition by the press that there has to be some -- it has to be reasonable judgments made as they are made everyday by this Court, and who sits in its own press box.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.831" offset="8036101">I think in cases of severe abuse, they would be but I think that -- I mean the right -- the First Amendment right is a personal right, but it is not an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.933" offset="8088451">It is subject to reasonable regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.314" offset="8102034">That’s recognized in case after case by this Court, and one of the implications of as this for example, is that there will be a limited number of reporters in the courtroom during a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.314" offset="8158041">And I do not think that that means that all reporters should at everyone who ever claims to be a reporter or every reporter for every established newspaper, or everyone should be banned from having interview, personal interviews with pre-identified inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.419" offset="8238393">I would note that it is not simply a situation where the -- where we can speculate that the press will always want to interview the man creating the disturbance or always want to interview Jimmy Hopper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.697" offset="8283533">Surely, they want to interview poeple that are celebrities, for example on television Saturday Night in CBS had an interview with Budd Crowe, who is out in Allan Wood at a time when the policy prohibited personal interviews and there he was photographed for 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.206" offset="8341525">But Mr. Bagdikian in the record of this case was not after people who had created a disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.882" offset="8364304">He was not after celebrities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.105" offset="8377156">He was after group of people who have been selected to sit on a negotiating committee with the prison officials after a non-violent demonstration at Lewisburg and at Danbury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.195" offset="8421564">And he wanted to find out as the record shows, why the problems were resolved in those prisons non-violently?</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.969" offset="8452598">How that came about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.277" offset="8457822">He was not after the “big wheel” if you will or the major celebrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.024" offset="8480810">My own closing with respect to this is that the -- as far as the Washington Post and Mr. Bagdikian is concerned and as our brief reflects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.747" offset="8539742">It is our firm conviction that one of the reasons why prisons are in the condition that they are in today, the condition that’s been described by the Chief Justice many, many times is, because the First Amendment has not been permitted to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.085" offset="8605048">The way it operates on Government, the way it operates in schools, the way it operates in virtually every other facet of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.132" offset="8641306">The First Amendment has not been permitted to let a little sunshine in to those prisons, and let the reporters whose right becomes even more critical when the average American, when the citizen cannot walk through every prison in interview, every prisoner he desires, and let them go in to the prisons and get the story of the prisons out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.772" offset="8731794">The First Amendment is part of that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.475" offset="8742661">I can understand as any one can that this policy is very convenient and very helpful for the warden, administrators, wardens and administrators in the Bureau of Prison System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.481" offset="8794697">There isn’t a single member running in United States Government Department or Bureau, or court, or university, or anything in this country, or military base that would not be delighted to have a regulation that prohibited interviews in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.057" offset="8856973">But that’s not what are system is all about, and that’s not what the First Amendment is all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2249.884" offset="9076297">They perceived that this kind of interview was quite troublesome so that of course they have to rehabilitate and to maintain order.</text>
