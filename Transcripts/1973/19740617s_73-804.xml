            <text syncTime="14.035" offset="132911">This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.913" offset="152451">It involves the suit by trustee of a railroad in reorganization under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act for freight charges, the suit being against the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.638" offset="203337">Shipper counterclaimed for cargo loss and damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.641" offset="223295">The trustee had his judgment for his freight charges and the shipper for his cargo damages and the question arose whether the shipper could set off his judgment for the cargo damage against what he owed to railroad for freight charges and pay over only the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.815" offset="296020">The Court of Appeals held that the shipper could set off on judgment against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.200" offset="325590">In an opinion that Mr. Justice Douglas has written for the Court, we reverse that judgment and hold that in the circumstances present here in this railroad reorganization, the set off was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.008" offset="384731">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed an opinion concurring in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.125" offset="401241">Mr. Justice Powell joined him and Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
