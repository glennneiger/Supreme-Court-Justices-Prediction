            <label>Mr. Peter G. Nash</label>
            <text syncTime="259.500" offset="1114697">There is no evidence in the record which would indicate that the bulletin board was the consideration given to the union for their waiver of the statutory right of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.017" offset="1164852">But there is a clause in the collective bargaining agreement which does provide for bulletin board rights for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.529" offset="1198916">The facts in this case indicate that since 1954, the IUE has represented the company’s employees and that since that time the company has maintained a rule which is prohibited distribution of literature anywhere on company premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.886" offset="1260251">The Board in this case found that as a matter of fact the union had waived the right of employees to distribute literature on company property but found that the right of employees to make that kind of a distribution was so basic to the act that it could not in fact be waived by the collective bargaining agent of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.247" offset="1357740">The Board however, although it rationalized its decision based upon an earlier decision in Gale Products declined to apply the Gale Products remedy which had been applied sometime earlier in a number of cases between Gale Products in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.144" offset="1429316">In that remedy, the Board said that the employer and the union could not agree to a rule which prohibited employees from distributing literature against the interest of that incumbent union, but they could agree to a rule which prohibited employees from distributing literature on behalf of the union which had presumably waived that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.780" offset="1511863">The Board in the case now before you, for the first time has said that that that remedy that it had provided before does not make a great deal of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.973" offset="1552614">And as a matter of fact, there is nothing in the act which indicates that the right to dissent from union representation is any more protected than the right to support or defend you collective bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.088" offset="1597127">As a consequence, the remedy in this case now before you provided by the Board requires that the company cease and desist from enforcing this rule as to the distribution of any literature for or on behalf of any labor organization including the incumbent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.851" offset="1668180">The Court of Appeals in the Sixth Circuit upheld the Board’s factual finding supported by substantial evidence that there had been a waiver here, but rejected the Board’s Gale Product’s rationale and held that a bargaining representative has the authority to waive on premises distribution rights of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.594" offset="1747174">A brief history of the litigation in this area maybe of some assistance, since 1944 and up unto the Gale Products case the Board held that and the employer and the union could waive the Section 7 rights of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.636" offset="1811331">In the Gale Products decision, the Board held for the first time that such a waiver was in ineffective as I explained before, at least as to the distribution of materials against the interest of the union which attempted to waive this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.374" offset="1866292">Both the Sixth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have disagreed with the Board and have said that the right of management and labor to freely contract is such an important right that that ought to stand even against the Section 7 rights of employees to distribute literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.451" offset="1930553">The Fifth and the Eighth Circuits have both agreed with the Board and have held that the right of employees to distribute literature related to the rejection or retention of a collective bargaining agent is so basic to the Act that it cannot be waived by the union which might in fact itself be benefited by that waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.279" offset="2005891">Further, these Courts of Appeals, the Fifth Circuit and Eighth Circuit, have indicated that the existence or nonexistence of any other alternative means of communication which might or might not be available to the employees is irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.242" offset="2309747">The issue has not been presented in this case, Your Honor, and it was not litigated and has not been argued in any form below.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.524" offset="2338795">I might add, that at least relevant to the argument in the last case, the Mason &amp; Hanger case decided by the Fifth Circuit prior to the commencement of the litigation in this case, and in that case -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.581" offset="2415073">In that case the Fifth Circuit said that this right not to distribute literature was a protected right of employees, but that the union could waive its right as to the distribution of literature for its own internal organizational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.107" offset="2485185">In the Eighth Circuit’s -- the Eighth Circuit's decision in the previous case indicated that the Eighth Circuit felt that the employees rights to distribute literature on behalf on its own collective bargaining agent could not be waived, and the decision in that case preceded the litigation in this case, so that to the extent the same kinds of issues might come up in this case as did in the last in those arguments before you, at least the Eighth Circuit had indicated that there was a feeling that employees rights in this area couldn’t be waived either for or against the incumbent.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.225" offset="2633665">In arguing its position, the company in this case contends that the mere existence of an agreement between the employer and the union concerning this distribution right is sufficient reason to change the normal rule which would prohibit any restriction on employee’s distributions of literature in nonwork areas on nonwork time.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.182" offset="2713496">However, the company doesn’t tell us anywhere why the existence of an agreement ought to change the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.836" offset="2736065">I’d like to direct my attention to the reasons that passed by the Board and by the courts as to why the existence of this agreement should make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.377" offset="2774204">I believe in dealing this issue it would be helpful to start by saying that we are not really dealing here with any literal balancing of the right to contract against the employee’s right of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.390" offset="2822269">Clearly employees have the right to distribute literature in nonwork areas and nonwork time absent of valid contractual waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.316" offset="2854034">The question before this Court is whether the Board may properly find an attempt of such a waiver to be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.132" offset="2877231">To discuss cases and legal doctrines upholding the right of the unions and management to freely contract really begs the question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.776" offset="2907847">The whole issue here is whether that right to contract should apply to an attempted waiver of distribution right.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.276" offset="2933864">If the distribution right can be waived, freedom of contract doctrine stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.257" offset="2949747">If it shouldn’t be and can’t be waived as the Board has set, then the right to contract can’t prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.402" offset="4554397">I think the Court has recognized this in its language in the Republic Aviation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.869" offset="4576235">Clearly the Fifth Circuit in the Mid-States Metal Products decision recognized this fact that the right to freedom to organize belongs to dissidents as well as the bargaining agents, and limiting its exercise by non-solicitation agreements, tends to smother competitive union organizational activity and accordingly militates against the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.632" offset="4659304">The Court went on to say, “We believe that the individual organizational rights at issue guaranteed by the Act are too fundamental to be contracted away.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.137" offset="4693264">I might add that the union in its reply brief filed last Friday takes somewhat different view, but basically comes out the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.617" offset="4723252">In that brief, they argued that an employee’s Section 7 rights maybe waived only when that waiver furthers the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.307" offset="4757943">Thus, the union -- thus, the Act encourages industrial peace, and thus the Board and the courts have found that the right to strike can be waived when as a quid pro quo for that the union and the employer agreed to peaceful arbitration for the resolution of industrial disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.993" offset="4832758">However, the right to select or reject the union is not furthered by waiving the distribution rights of employees, and thus under this analysis, that right cannot be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.211" offset="4873613">I submit that under either analysis however, the significance or unique type of right with which we are dealing here, the right to distribute literature on these issues is the right which cannot be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.052" offset="4928993">Further on analysis of the relationship and the interest between the employees whose right is sought to be waived, and union which seeks the waiver, I believe compels affirmance to the Board’s conclusion that at least that incumbent collective bargaining agent cannot waive the individual rights of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.093" offset="4993149">The kinds of Section 7 rights which the Board and the courts have found to be waivable by a union are those in which the union’s interest and the employee’s interest may be said to be in harmony, because of the nature of the right involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.668" offset="5043409">Thus, in the right to strike, as I indicated before, that’s an employee right, but clearly the basic strength of a union is closely tied to and depends upon the continued right of its members to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.700" offset="5095549">Thus, it’s not surprising that the Board and the courts have upheld the right of a union to waive the right to strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.709" offset="5651540">I think as the Court indicated in its Mastro Plastics decision where the activity of the employer committing an unfair labor practice is so destructive of the collective bargaining relationship, that the right to strike may not be presumed to be waived, and may in fact not be waivable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.897" offset="5732310">Thus, in the Mastro Plastics case where the employer dismissed an employee because he sought to campaign in behalf of the incumbent union where the employer wanted another union, and the employee was dismissed and there was a strike both in violation of a No-Strike Clause and the collective bargaining agreement, and arguably in violation of Section 8 (d) of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.397" offset="5810364">This Court has held that where that employer action wants so to the relationship, the collective bargaining relationship as to attempt to destroy it, it may well be that the union may not be able to waive the rights of employees in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.789" offset="5879954">I submit it’s the same kind of situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.946" offset="5892493">The right to distribute literature for or on behalf union representation goes to the very heart of the collective bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.993" offset="5940767">Let me give just a couple of examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.376" offset="5954247">Under the National Labor Relations Act, under the Board doctrine as has exist to date, employees may not file a decertification petition, nor may they file a petition on behalf of another union except between the 90th and the 60th day preceding the termination of a collective bargaining agreement or after the end of the collective bargaining agreement if the employer and the union have not, during that 60-day period, entered into a new agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.802" offset="6055915">To hold the union, an employer may agree that employees can’t distribute literature in furtherance of either a decertification campaign or in furtherance of a campaign to change the collective bargaining agent during the term of the collective bargaining agreement, takes away significantly from the right and the ability of those employees to file such a petition within that 60 to 90-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.289" offset="6141910">If the union interested in its own preservation and incumbency can obtain and enforce such a waiver from the employer and further can enter into a collective bargaining agreement with that employer within the 60-day period that can perpetuate itself indefinitely in power to the detriment of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.716" offset="6219651">The same kind of a situation arises under Section 9 (e) of the Act in the de-authorization proceeding where an election can be held during the term of a collective bargaining agreement to take away the right of the union to make an agreement which requires union membership as a condition of employment, to say that employees can’t campaign effectively through distribution and furtherance of that kind of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.230" offset="6313691">As the Sixth Circuit's decision in this would say, I submit again, takes away that very important right from employees. And again --</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.779" offset="6531866">And I think further, Member Fanning’s concurring opinion in this case has some validity and that is, that if the Gale Products rule is in fact correct that a union can’t waive the right of employees to distribute literature against its interest, then you’ve taken that out of the rule which the union agreed to, and the union never agreed to a rule, which said that “you can’t campaign before me, but you can’t campaign against me”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.734" offset="6647641">And therefore again, the Board has really divided employees into two different groups which doesn’t make a great deal of sense under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.101" offset="6677107">So I think if the Gale Products rule is correct, then I believe it to be correct, that it makes a great deal more sense to say that you just can’t interfere with this right, union and management, by agreement, can't interfere with this right in any event on either side of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.725" offset="6747638">I submit further that the employer’s argument in this case to the effect that alternative means of communication or alternative avenues of communication ought to be reviewed by the Board and the courts I think is a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.535" offset="6802913">This Court has said in the Republic Aviation case in essence that there is no right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.892" offset="6824333">There is not effective alternative means of communication available to employees leaving out strangers and outsiders for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.210" offset="6861636">There is no effective alternative means available to employees to communicate which would take and otherwise invalid restriction and make it not a violation of Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.546" offset="6970932">So they were talking about both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.199" offset="6977515">I believe that the best discussion of the Republic Aviation decision can be found in the United Aircraft decision cited in our brief of the Second Circuit in which it goes into a good bit of detail as to why as a matter of law there just is no other effective alternate means of communication available to protect the employee Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.909" offset="7072392">Where that doctrine has arisen is in the cases of outside union organizers who are attempting to organize employees, and in all circumstances for those employees can be prohibited from even going on the employer’s premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.267" offset="7133832">This Court has said and the Board has said that where other means of communicating with employees are so difficult that the union can’t really effectively get its message to the employees in very limited circumstances, the employer may be required to open his premises to those outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.566" offset="7218991">But nowhere have the Board and the Court said that there are effective alternative means to the employee ability to distribute or solicit on premises during nonworking time and in nonworking areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.494" offset="7282730">So I submit that really the combination of the very important right involved here, plus the fact that the union’s interest may very well and most likely will be in conflict with the interest of the employees right itself, those two things I think dictate an affirmance of the Court of the Board’s award and a reversal to the Sixth Circuit’s judgment in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.613" offset="7411252">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.697" offset="7423582">I hate to take issue with Mr. Nash, but it seems to me that we are faced directly here with freedom of contract under the National Labor Relations Act as opposed to the right of employees to distribute literature, and I think this is the primary issue that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.538" offset="7502890">Before getting into that discussion, I believe that there are several factual situations which should be brought out that have been ignored by general counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.377" offset="7542282">First of all, there was no organizational activity going on at any time during the period of the enforcement of this rule leading to the filing of the unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.274" offset="7593796">The literature to be distributed was to be distributed by and on behalf of the incumbent union about an internal union matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.538" offset="7626919">It was in accordance with the waiver rejected for passing out on company property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.004" offset="7660774">Secondly, the general counsel has totally ignored the fact that employees are totally able to solicit and discuss any matters they so desire on company premises anywhere at anytime that does not involve their work time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.722" offset="7739664">Therefore, we do not have the Republic Aviation situation of a no distribution and no solicitation situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.740" offset="7775713">Additionally, the evidence on the record demonstrated thoroughly that ultimate avenues of communication were available, utilized and effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.277" offset="7817822">The evidence demonstrated that through the 16-year history between the union and the employer, that employees who wanted to pass out material were able to do so effectively by standing at the plant entrances off of company property to make their distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.819" offset="7900056">Thus, I think we have three highly relevant factors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.210" offset="7913639">One, no organizational activity going on; two, an ability of the employees to discuss and solicit on company property; and three, an effective use of an alternate means of distribution on company property, i.e. being able to distribute right at the plant entrance which they had done for over 16 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.593" offset="8103079">As to the full discussion during nonwork time in all areas of the plant, I think that is recited in the Appendix at Page 127 and 136.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.439" offset="8166504">Quite contrary to a red herring situation of alternative means of communication being available, I think that is extremely germane to a consideration of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.644" offset="8211331">It has been considered germane by the Seventh Circuit when they overruled the Board in Gale Products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.732" offset="8231706">It was considered germane by the Sixth Circuit when they overruled the Board in Armco Steel, when they overruled the Board in General Motors, and when they overruled the Board in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.784" offset="8275905">It has also been considered, I think, germane by the Board itself in its later determinations in Stoddard-Quirk as well as in its discussion on Gale Products itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.922" offset="8328464">Now, what we have is going back to the history of the Board’s development of this line, is in 1944 the May Company case basically held that this right was not so fundamental that it could not be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.166" offset="8389381">And that basically was the status of the law until the 1963 Gale Products case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.197" offset="8413518">In that case, which again involved a total ban against solicitation and a total ban against distribution on company property, the Board followed basically the Republic Aviation theory that because of the ban on distribution of literature and because of the ban on solicitation with solicitation being shown as being the place uniquely appropriate for employees to discuss their policy, that there was an impediment to the Section 7 rights of employees here which had not been overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.494" offset="8570776">Now, there was a very strong dissent in the Gale Products case by the Chairman at that time Mr. McCullough and by Member Leedham (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.873" offset="8604212">They pointed out that certainly, alternate means of communication were available here, employees were able to discuss matters on company property during their free time, and stated as such there should be a waiver capable by the incumbent union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.629" offset="8703269">The majority of the Board in a footnote took cognizance of the minority’s opinion particularly as to whether or not they could freely discuss on company property, matters such as changing or retaining the collective bargaining agent, and stated that the evidence to their satisfaction showed that that was not the case that these matters could not be discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.730" offset="8803683">Secondly, as to alternative means available, the majority in Gale Products found that there was no evidence to this effect, and therefore, went with there presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.177" offset="8853420">Now, the Seventh Circuit as I noted earlier, overruled Gale Products saying that no presumption should stand here that we are talking really about freedom of contract, and if there are effective alternative means available, then the Section 7 rights of the employees has not been impaired, and freedom of contract should be given full reign and the validity of the contract procedure should stand absent a showing of an actual interference in Section 7 rights, which had not been done in Gale Products, in Armco nor has it been done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.082" offset="9005035">In fact, the Board chose in this case to totally ignore the alternate means of communication available, used and found effective by the union throughout its 16-year history, and chose to rely instead simply upon the presumption found in Stoddard-Quirk and Republic Aviation and Peyton Packing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.509" offset="9102733">We would submit that this is totally contrary to the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act, and contrary to the duty of the National Labor Relations Board to enforce that Act and foster collective bargaining.</text>
