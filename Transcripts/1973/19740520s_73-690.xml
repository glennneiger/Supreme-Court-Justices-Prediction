            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">I also have 73-690, Air Pollution Variance Board of Colorado versus The Western Alfalfa Corp here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Colorado, which held the -- an inspection by a state health inspector to be in violation of the Fourth Amendment, because the inspection was made without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.515" offset="206785">The health inspector entered the outdoor premises of respondent in daylight without his knowledge or consent to make an opacity test of smoke, the Ringelmann test commonly used to measure the density of the smoke that was being emitted from the respondent's chimneys, a sight that could be observed from many different points on the premises and off the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.275" offset="333845">We hold that the -- no warrant under the Fourth Amendment was needed under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.154" offset="377313">Thus as Court has held previously in the cases cited that the search does not require a warrant, but extends only to sights that are seen in the open fields and this was comparable to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.541" offset="466860">Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals of Colorado on that point and remand to it for consideration of such other questions as maybe left open.</text>
