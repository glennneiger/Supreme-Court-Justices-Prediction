            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We'll hear arguments next in 72-5794, Davis against Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.796" offset="191948">Mr. Wagstaff, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Wagstaff</label>
            <text syncTime="31.804" offset="203964">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.489" offset="218697">The issue presented to the Court in this case is the virtual confrontation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment against a state statute and court rule which provides that juvenile record shall remain secret and anonymous in virtually all cases, save when the juvenile is being sentenced as an adult and the court in its discretion feels that the juvenile record would be relevant or desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.843" offset="348160">In this particular case, the statute and court rule was applied when a juvenile was testifying for the prosecution as a chief identification witness against the accused, petitioner Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.618" offset="407197">Now we sought at trial to use this -- his juvenile record, not simply to impeach his character with prior wrongful acts, but rather to show that he had biased, prejudiced and was testifying out of fear and favor when he identified petitioner Joshua Davis at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.181" offset="489430">The court's protective order or the court entered a protective order, the trial Court did, during the voir dire examination for the jurors and at that time, the issues were fully raised or actually presented in our briefs today.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.557" offset="542929">The confrontation issue was argued to the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.199" offset="561528">There has here been a significant diminution of cross-examination and this calls into question integrity of the whole fact-finding process and requires that the competing interest be closely examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.098" offset="633104">The facts of the Davis case really bespeak the legal issues raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.428" offset="670511">A safe was found on some property next to a truck, approximately 25 miles from North of Anchorage, Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.767" offset="703843">The stepson of the owner of this property, owned this particular truck and was on a probation for burglary as a juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.143" offset="745326">He had committed acts which should he have been an adult would be burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.351" offset="762149">He had been adjudicated a juvenile delinquent and was under probation at that time to the Juvenile Court, he was sixteen years of age and lived on this particular property.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="179.895" offset="796317">Was that his only collision with the law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_wagstaff" startTime="183.432" stopTime="366.327">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Wagstaff</label>
            <text syncTime="183.432" offset="810527">To our knowledge, we never actually were provided with the record at that time, but the respondent has admitted in essence what I have just related to the Court in their particular brief, we don't believe that's at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.550" offset="874998">We desired to bring this fact out to the jury in order to show that this witness was initially afraid that he was going to be linked into a burglary charge himself because this witness turned out to be the key critical identification witness and indeed the one essential witness had trialled against Joshua Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.954" offset="980532">The story that Mr. Green, the boy Green gave to the police officers when they came up to investigate the situation was that earlier in the day he had been walking in the area where the safe was found and observed two black men to be standing near a recent, a late-model Chevrolet automobile metallic in color.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.976" offset="1076663">He said that he talked to them briefly and asked what they were doing there and he asked they had any trouble and they related that they just said something to him, “Is your father here?”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.462" offset="1134550">He progressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.051" offset="1136953">He said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.653" offset="1139357">He progressed and came back later and stated that he observed these two men on same position, one with a crowbar.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.463" offset="1162553">He stated that he probably could identify them.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.099" offset="1173107">The next day Green was taken down to the police station in Anchorage and apparently coercive environment to begin with, coupled with this, he was taken into a small room in the presence of four detectives, seated between the two chief -- the two actual investigating officers, one of them was packaging pistols apparently in connection with another case and given either five or six photographs and asked to see if he could identify one or both of the persons that he claimed to have seen standing where this safe was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.175" offset="1333499">Now at this particular point in time, our theory of the case and the one that we were precluded from presenting to the jury was that Green was under a lot of pressure then to identify someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.605" offset="1383131">He in his own mind if not actually was a suspect of this burglary and was under strong impetus to in fact pick someone out of these photographs in order to take the heat off of himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.092" offset="1433078">Again, the jury was not aware of these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.420" offset="1446452">He did in fact take a picture out, one of which was the picture of Joshua Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.422" offset="1470485">There was a subsequent line up and then an identification at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.007" offset="1488771">Our point is that when this initial photographic identification was made, Green was then and from that point forward locked into this identification and this was the critical point in time when the identification --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="366.327" offset="1542060">Before you leave that police station situation, I noticed on page 34 that you were referring to earlier, there was a general question in the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.613" offset="1611233">Had you -- this is addressed to Green, had you been questioned like that before by any law enforcement officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="391.671" offset="1643416">I would assume for the moment at least that that was some kind of an effort to perhaps lay grounds for impeaching him and he answered no, when in fact as we now know on the total record, if he had been involved as a juvenile and was on probation, he must have been at some time interrogated by police officers in the past.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="428.340" offset="1790119">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_wagstaff" startTime="428.809" stopTime="772.423">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Wagstaff</label>
            <text syncTime="428.809" offset="1792000">No, I did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.267" offset="1797851">An objection was made at that time when I asked that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.569" offset="1811017">There was a negative response.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.317" offset="1821989">That objection was incomplete, attempting to raise in the jury's mind and the court said simply I'll sustain the objection and at that point I believe that the court and the record reflects was referring to its prior protective order that we couldn't get into that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.442" offset="1898475">Respondent attempts to limit the meaning of that question with the words like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.450" offset="1918537">I think when the question is read in conjunction with the prior questions which was and then you went into the investigating room with Investigator Gray and Investigator Weaver, yeah, and they started asking you questions about the incident, is that correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="475.973" offset="1980604">Yeah.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.592" offset="1983112">Have you ever been questioned like that before by any law enforcement officers?</text>
            <text syncTime="479.873" offset="1996278">The answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.596" offset="2003174">Again, we feel that this answer itself was -- must have been untruthful and we were precluded from showing this to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.051" offset="2040999">Also we not only were prohibited from cross-examining Green on this point, but the police investigators as well with respect to particular pressures they may have put on Green at the time of the initial photographic identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.411" offset="2098364">Particularly Investigator Gray was asked, did you at any time suspect Green to be involved in this burglary?</text>
            <text syncTime="511.994" offset="2124696">He responded no.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.010" offset="2132741">Cross-examination at that point was precluded on how is your negative response consistent with your knowledge that he in fact was a juvenile on probation for burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.750" offset="2175791">The safe was found on his land next to his truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.415" offset="2186449">Again that question was precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.108" offset="2201182">The prosecution at trial made the most of their protective order.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.774" offset="2219886">The jury was in essence given a distorted view of exactly what Green was and who he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.709" offset="2255621">The protective order of course came during the voir dire examination, so any mention of the problem, the juvenile record would not come before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.357" offset="2298149">In closing the argument, the prosecution stated that the petitioner's entire defense, which -- our entire defense was that the Green's identification was unreliable, that he was under pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.041" offset="2352901">We tried to show just by the fact that he was -- the safe was found on his property next to his truck that he would be under pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.676" offset="2375471">That was our defense, this was developed an opening statement throughout the trial and closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.199" offset="2397518">The prosecution in the closing argument claimed that this was a total red herring issue, one that we had just made up and that there is no basis for this belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.552" offset="2439001">He also said and I am referring to pages 422 and 424 of the transcript that our defense of bias and prejudice in fear and favor on part of Green came as a result of pure suspicion of society and suspicion of law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.369" offset="2514233">Of course, the prosecutor must have known in his own mind, at least, the origins of our attack on witness Green's credibility and any bias or any fear and favor he had in testifying, that came from other independent sources than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.035" offset="2588839">As a result of Green's identification at the station house, his search warrant was obtained for the car belonging to petitioner Joshua Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.963" offset="2636591">A search was made of records of rental car agencies, the police suspected because of the description of the car, maybe it is a rental car.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.608" offset="2667207">They found the car rented to petitioner, obtained a search warrant for the premises, his house and also vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.102" offset="2697195">As a result of this search, they found evidence inferentially relating petitioner's car to being present perhaps at the scene or actually with having had a safe, perhaps, in the trunk of the rented car at one time as to extent of the other evidence presented against petitioner at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.356" offset="2790191">The actual evidence in the trunk of the car were insulation fibers that could have come from a safe and paint chips that could have come from the safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.811" offset="2831987">This was the extent of the identification of these particular substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.685" offset="2851527">There was no -- there were no fibers or paint chips found on petitioner's clothing or on shoes or nor was the money found that was allegedly in the safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.863" offset="2904189">None of the things that the search warrant basically was seeking were ever found, just these small items of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.222" offset="2933656">This is important, of course, to lead to the significance of Green's identification, the crucial nature, the essential nature of his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.900" offset="2972317">Its essential nature, I do not believe is actually in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.227" offset="2985691">It was admitted at trial during the motion for a protective order described as essential witness with that very word.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.192" offset="3017561">Also, the Alaska Supreme Court in their opinion described him as an essential witness, that the case could not have been made without him.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.318" offset="3082031">The trial judge ruled on the issue, on the basis strictly of the state statute and the rule involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.550" offset="3110975">He initially was inclined to rule in our favor as the record reflects and stated when he reversed himself that he really didn't agree with what he was doing, but he felt constrained to do so by a specific court rule in Alaska and which is cited, of course, he is doing--</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.618" offset="5783197">One is the cruciality of the un-confronted testimony and the other is that this Court likes to see just how mislead the fact-finder has been by not hearing the confrontation that has been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.229" offset="5853623">And I must concede that Richard Green's testimony was crucial to the state's case against Joshua Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.768" offset="5899807">My argument is that the jury was not significantly mislead by the denial of cross-examination, by not having heard about the juvenile record and by not hearing cross-examination in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.607" offset="6047138">In determining just how mislead the jurors were, I would like to emphasize here at the outset that Richard Green was on the stand, he was immediately cross-examined, in all areas except this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.379" offset="6110250">He was under oath.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.308" offset="6649940">Mr. Wagstaff at that time could have made an offer of proof, an offer of proof that perjury had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.438" offset="6674495">And if he could have shown that, then I would think that the Court would have had to have allowed in this juvenile record, because if you have got perjury on the stand, certainly, the defense counsel should be able to impeach with whatever means is necessary to bring out the fact that there has been perjury on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.983" offset="6756728">As the record now stands and he has never raised this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.372" offset="6770207">In his brief he simply says in this one statement, counsel asked if he had ever been questioned before by law enforcement officers?</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.416" offset="6922449">Oh, yes, but of course, a rule cannot stand if it's unconstitutional for its application, to be -- for it to be applied and there is another rule in the Alaska Criminal Rules, Rule 57 which says that in the interest of justice, we can't dispense with any of the foregoing rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.549" offset="7006981">The rule would I submit have had to have been abandoned at that point, if during the offer of proof, it had come out that Richard Green had perjured himself by the statement, then I would think that defense counsel would have been able to bring out the juvenile record at that point or his right to confront the witnesses against him would be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.595" offset="7119099">But Mr. Wagstaff in getting off this point, was able to question closely about whether or not Richard Green considered himself under suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.982" offset="7160686">And as the Alaska Supreme Court stressed, the jury was able to observe his demeanor while he was being questioned this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.687" offset="7199451">The facts that work out from the jurors did somewhat impeach Richard Green's testimony the fact that he had been convicted of a crime, did somewhat impugn his credibility that's being a larcenous type crime, a burglary of two cabins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.917" offset="7264444">The fact that he was on probation showed that he had somewhat of a motive to quickly identify somebody else to hoist the blame onto someone else to take the suspicion that he felt was on himself or perhaps even to fabricate his story in order to aid himself in the eyes of the law enforcement people he had to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.028" offset="7344901">But, these facts are not that impeaching in themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.030" offset="7368829">As for the argument that the conviction it show -- itself impeaches his credibility in the sense that this was a larcenous type crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.818" offset="7411984">Mr. Wagstaff is not relying much upon this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.548" offset="7426926">As Mr. Justice White was bringing out, the Alaska Supreme Court, indicated in the opinion that this was not Mr. Wagstaff's main argument that it should have been brought in as a conviction itself to impeach credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.728" offset="7503621">He has a further argument, that is, that there was a motive here because of the probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.833" offset="7528072">Mr. Justice Rehnquist mentioned the possibility of totally abolishing for any witness, the use of prior records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.089" offset="7569136">Now in February this year, Alaska -- the Alaska Supreme Court did promulgate a rule, that says you cannot use for any witness, any criminal conviction if it is over five years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.128" offset="7617306">I can see problems there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.385" offset="7626292">If there is a perjury conviction and that's six years old in the state's witness as the perjury conviction behind him, is a crucial witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.221" offset="7661610">I can definitely see there are problems that the defense counsel would be denied his right to confront, if he could not answer a question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.172" offset="8869407">Now, perhaps most importantly, there was a story given to the trooper on the very day that the burglary occurred on the very day that the safe was found out at his stepfather's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.458" offset="8918622">And he said I saw these two men beside a late model, metallic blue, Chevrolet Sedan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.854" offset="8948193">The very next day he went down to police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.709" offset="8955611">He picked out, out of six pictures, and I believe the record will show that, I know will show that the Alaska Supreme Court opinion is wrong in that respect, there were six pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.430" offset="9002423">They are identified in the record, exhibits 25-30 I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.247" offset="9029695">He picked out and also the Alaska Supreme Court opinion is wrong when it says, he picked two pictures, he picked out one picture, the record will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.122" offset="9061251">So he picked out of six pictures, the picture of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.523" offset="9082880">He was able to do this even though it was ten years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.868" offset="9092180">He did not show the petitioner with a mustache in the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.850" offset="9116108">Although at the scene of the burglary he had a mustache at the lineup, two days after the photo lineup he had a mustache and two days after the photo identification there was a Capoeira lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.627" offset="9179220">He again picked the man out, out of a group of seven men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.650" offset="9191340">He picked two men at that time, one as representing the other man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.494" offset="9210776">So he picked Joshua Davis, and as it turned out the evidence was that Joshua Davis had rented a late model of 1969, burglary having occurred in February of 1970, metallic blue, Chevrolet Impala.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.739" offset="9291755">At this point, maybe I should mention that Mr. Wagstaff contends that there was a coercive atmosphere there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.272" offset="9341806">Yet, there really is nothing in record, that shows there wasn't anything suggestive about the photo identification, nothing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.468" offset="9366570">He was in a room down at the police station true, but there is evidence in the record that no indication was made during the pick out of such and such a picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.032" offset="9412859">His testimony to that affect is none to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.319" offset="9426024">Nothing at all on the record showing that the photo identification was suggestive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.516" offset="9442847">There is lots of evidence about how this lineup was conducted, again nothing, the Capoeira (ph) lineup, nothing indicated, that wasn't anyway suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.047" offset="9480986">Now, not only did he rent the car that was described, but the police developed evidence or discovered evidence that on the day of the burglary, shortly afternoon, Joshua Davis extended the rental contract by paying from a large roll of bills, $50, and two rolls of quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.644" offset="9579311">And the story that Richard Green had given was that he had seen these men out there shortly before noon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.212" offset="9601567">Also, in the trunk of the car there were paint chips and fibers, found that, I submit, virtually conclusively show that that safe was in that trunk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.041" offset="9684950">When you look at the harmless error argument, you look at whether or not the jury would have been swayed to vote differently, if it had heard this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.223" offset="9737613">Now I have just given you some evidence that the jury hasn't even heard, that is, the contract extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.866" offset="9764258">Jury never heard about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.326" offset="9770005">I submit that the test is whether or not this evidence was reliable, viewing all that we know about this testimony, you know, all we know, was it reliable enough so that this jury was given reliable testimony was not misled as to this testimony, so that an innocent man was not convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.599" offset="9855164">It is not an harmless error argument as such and that you do look at other evidences, aside from what the record contains, not that the jury heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.853" offset="9904170">Mr. Wagstaff says that all that the paint chips and fibers showed was that, a safe could have been in the safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.908" offset="9944398">The FBI agent told about performing a microchemical analysis on the fibers and he said that he had never found this particular composition materials in the fibers anywhere within safes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.451" offset="10014511">He compared the fibers from the safe with the fibers in the trunk, he said they matched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.059" offset="10033006">He said that just by looking at the fibers in the trunk, he could almost conclude for sure that they came from a Mosler safe, this was a Mosler safe, and you have the paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.789" offset="10075951">There were three layers of paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.712" offset="10087549">Again a microchemical analysis on each layer was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.930" offset="10104477">The evidence virtually shows beyond any doubt that that trunk did contain that safe at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.097" offset="10137182">Also, Richard Green, when he first told the story to the trooper, said that the man he talked with, whom he later identified as Joshua Davis, who was wearing a brown or black mackinaw jacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.916" offset="10196428">When the safe was later examined, there was found to be of little reddish brown material on one of the rough edges where it had been broken into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.551" offset="10226939">Joshua Davis's description is given by Richard Green did not vary from his actual description and as to the tires in the reply brief, Mr. Wagstaff said that I unduly relied upon the evidence concerning the tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.438" offset="10310531">There were two sets of tire tracks out there, and one set of tire tracks went up to where the safe was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.654" offset="10339370">There had been a snow two or three days earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.321" offset="10350028">These were the only tire tracks there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.971" offset="10364656">The officer investigator Gray testified that he examined the two sets of tire tracks, both appeared to be made by snow tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.406" offset="10402377">The two tracks had been made by different vehicles and then when he was asked by Mr. Wagstaff, at questioning, he said the snow tires on the rear of the vehicle appeared to be the same and he met there and it was clear from the questioning, appear to be the same on these tracks that led up to the place where the safe was dumped off, as the tires on the back of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.281" offset="10505822">So you have all this corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.939" offset="10516480">The other fact that he was on the stand and the jury was able to observe his demeanor, he was under oath to the extent that he was cross-examined and his testimony contained sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the jury having heard this testimony even without the denied cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.302" offset="10605923">The jury still possessed a satisfactory basis for examining the truthfulness of this testimony and Joshua Davis was not denied a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.914" offset="10676454">In the confrontation cases of this Court, the thing is look not only to the damage done to the integrity of the fact-finding process, but the cases look to the underlying reasons behind the denial of the confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.118" offset="10777182">And if there has been a significant misleading of the jury concerning crucial testimony, that reason has to be closely examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.610" offset="10827233">In this case the jury was not significantly misled concerning the crucial testimony, but even if we close examine the -- closely examine the reason behind denying the cross-examination in the area, the juvenile record here, it will bear up to the the scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.049" offset="10912914">If juvenile records had to be revealed in cases that would not benefit in which it would not benefit the defense, anymore than it would have in this case, then many juvenile records will have to be revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.931" offset="10972473">And, of course, that will open somewhat of the breach and the juvenile system structure and there will be an attempted to damage to the system as such and it will adversely affect many juvenile witnesses who have juvenile -- many witnesses who have juvenile records and it will especially affect us, you are still being rehabilitated at the time they have to take the stand such as was the case here with Richard Green.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.836" offset="13928072">And that’s why Green’s testimony was particularly essential that he established a link in the prosecution’s chain of evidence of recent possession and his testimony, absent his testimony there could have been a conviction.</text>
