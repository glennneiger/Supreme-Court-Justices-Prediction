            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="60.350" offset="318171">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.791" offset="335935">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.972" offset="372611">That Court by a divided vote, held that the Ohio Law of trade secrets was preempted by the federal patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.407" offset="422348">On this basis, it reversed a judgment which had been entered by the District Court, following an extensive trial, which had enjoined the respondents here from using and disclosing trade secrets which they had learned while they were in the employ of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.021" offset="516807">The facts are relatively simple as far as the issue before this Court is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.114" offset="545228">They maybe said, I think to present a classic case of equity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.757" offset="579814">The petitioner threw an unincorporated division called Harshaw, and manufactures various products in the chemical field.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.817" offset="620042">These include synthetic crystals and the particular product involved here is sodium iodide, thallium activated crystals.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.243" offset="681691">That means that it is basically sodium iodide, but by introducing some thallium in it, the crystal becomes effective in detecting radiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.591" offset="731115">And these crystals are useful in locating uranium ore and oil exploration, and through various medical purposes such as detecting malignant tumors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="212.558" offset="926929">Harshaw was a pioneer in this field and has been actively developing it for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.465" offset="962560">In 1949, it grew a sodium iodide thallium activated crystal, less than two inches in diameter.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.086" offset="1001117">By 1966, after the investment of much money and effort, it was able to grow a crystal 17 inches in diameter.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.750" offset="1043749">And I may say that these crystals are grown in -- in platinum crucibles that comes out a very substantial mass.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.061" offset="1092963">It is then sliced which is a very delicate operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.427" offset="1114488">It must be quickly encapsulated because it is heavily hydroscopic, it will absorb moisture.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.613" offset="1143223">When it absorbs moisture it melts.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.939" offset="1152522">This is full of delicate operations and the size of the crystal is significant among other things because that a 17 inch crystal will more or less cover the chest of a person who is being examined, whereas the smaller crystals, you’d have to use many and you might miss places.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.285" offset="1233920">Worldwide, there are several companies that compete with Harshaw in this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.704" offset="1255549">There are three in the United States other than the respondent, two in Japan and one each in Great Britain and France.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.816" offset="1292016">Up to date however, no company has grown or sold a 17 inch diameter crystal except Harshaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.128" offset="1325244">In producing such a crystal, Harshaw developed many confidential processes, procedures and techniques which it claims as trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.739" offset="1367667">There are six individual defendants, each of them was employed by Harshaw or by a subsidiary of Harshaw.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="330.952" offset="1400581">There is no patent involved here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="332.631" offset="1407269">There is no patent involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.594" offset="1415105">No claim is made based on a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.743" offset="1431719">Each entered into a contract with his employer that he would not disclose the confidential information of Harshaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.720" offset="1463589">Each of these employees occupied a position of trust and confidence with Harshaw and was given access to the secret operations in connection with his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.803" offset="1507997">Thus, each of the individual respondents was bound by contract and by fiduciary relationship resulting from his confidential employment, not to disclose Harshaw’s confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.833" offset="1568078">It’s one of the traditional functions of equity to enforce such obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.666" offset="1595455">While still employed by Harshaw, four of the individual respondents discussed the possibility of forming their own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.309" offset="1634011">In order to have a going business in the shortest period of time, they decided to make scintillation detectors using sodium iodide thallium activated crystals.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.843" offset="1684167">During the summer and fall of 1969, they associated the other individual respondents to them who had recently left Harshaw’s employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.542" offset="1730873">They built a plant which was completed in late 1969 or early 1970 and soon had produced a 17 inch sodium iodide thallium activated scintillation crystal.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.808" offset="1788029">The District Court found that there was imminent danger of disclosure of plaintiff’s trade secrets to Bicron which was the company they organized, and the use of these trade secrets by Bicron.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.790" offset="1847902">In April 1970, Kewanee filed this suit to enjoin the individual defendants in Bicron from using and disclosing Kewanee’s trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.674" offset="1895445">There was an extensive trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.049" offset="1904953">The District Court found that Kewanee had a protectable interest in 20 of the 40 trade secrets on which it relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.822" offset="1944033">It held that the other 20 were common knowledge and could be freely used.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.090" offset="1973081">Accordingly, it entered in a judgment enjoining Bicron and the individual respondents from disclosing and using the 20 trade secrets unless and until they became validly, publicly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.236" offset="2041731">Both sides appealed from this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.597" offset="2055105">Kewanee contended that all 40 trade secrets should have been protected, while Bircron cross-appealed claiming that none of the trade secrets should be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.839" offset="2100140">And the Court of Appeals after reviewing the record held that the findings of fact made by the District Court were not clearly erroneous within the meaning of Rule 52 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.301" offset="2157923">The Court further concluded that the District Court properly applied the Ohio Law relating to trade secrets, and then it said and I quote from the opinion as it is set out on page 16 of our brief, “On this record as a whole, it appears clear to us as it did to the District Court, that the individual defendants used the information obtained during their employment by Harshaw for the benefit of Bicron.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.640" offset="2283311">There can be no question on this record, but what these individual defendants appropriated to the benefit of Bicron, Harshaw’s secrets, processes, procedures and manufacturing techniques.”</text>
            <text syncTime="566.183" offset="2341512">And the Court of Appeals then concluded that it would affirm the judgment of the District Court, except for the conclusion that it reached, that the Ohio Law trade secrets is in direct conflict with the patent laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.433" offset="2406504">That is that the law of trade secrets is preempted by the patent laws, and on this basis the Court of Appeals reversed the order of the District Court which had entered an injunction against respondents, and that is the issue which he has -- been brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.303" offset="2493962">Now, there is nothing unusual about the Ohio Law relating to trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.773" offset="2515801">It’s similar to the law which has been long effect in most of the States and which is derived from English sources going back over a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.124" offset="2561254">It is indeed simply an application of the traditional equity principle, where dealing with threatened breach of contract, or violations of fiduciary obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.740" offset="2619664">Obviously, the value of a trade secret depends upon as being kept secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.944" offset="2644532">This does not mean that it cannot be disclosed in confidence or with suitable safeguards as a means of utilizing the secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.133" offset="2677238">But unless the safeguards can be enforced, that is the safeguards arising out of contract or out of fiduciary relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.849" offset="2716108">The secret will soon no longer be a secret and accordingly will have no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.247" offset="2749753">A trade secret is not the equivalent of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.665" offset="2771383">A patent when valid, gives a right reaching to the boundaries of the United States, effective against every person in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.868" offset="2816209">It is a true governmental grant of a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.724" offset="2835644">When a patent is granted, there is disclosure to the public, but no one may utilize the device of process without license for a period of 17 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.828" offset="2888098">This is true even as to a person who has independently dis -- conceived the same idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.937" offset="2920490">It’s true as to everyone within the outer limits of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.862" offset="2940238">It’s a true monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.467" offset="2954658">But a trade secret is much more limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.439" offset="2970540">It finds its substance as I have indicated in ordinary principles of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.468" offset="2994573">It’s enforced against persons only who have one way or another, undertaken an obligation not to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.550" offset="3034906">It may be enforced too against persons who obtain the secret wrongfully as by bribery or by burglary, as to all the world though, other than those who are bound by contract or by fiduciary duty, the trade secret maybe utilized by anyone who obtains it without wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.114" offset="3129156">Thus, it maybe uncovered by inspection by what is called reverse engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.969" offset="3160607">You take the thing that you have and a trained engineer works back to see how it was put together or by trial and error.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.744" offset="3199687">It may also be developed by anyone who carries on the same steps of research and development which were utilized by the original developer of the trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.525" offset="3250887">In this particular case, the record shows that there are a number of competitors who are in no way bound by contract or by fiduciary obligation, and all of them are free to develop the same trade secrets if they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.234" offset="3313685">Now, this would not be true with respect to a patent which binds all others no matter how independent or original their activities may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.891" offset="3368333">Now, the issue here is whether the state law of trade secrets long in effect and prevalent throughout the United States, has in some way been preempted by the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.564" offset="3422981">It’s true of course that Congress has been given power to grant patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.107" offset="3457149">Historically the States granted patents in the early days, but I don’t believe they do now.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.042" offset="3484944">It may well be true that Congress could under the necessary and proper law -- clause preempt the state law of trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.000" offset="3524754">Just as I suppose if Congress could preempt the copyright field, so as to invalidate all state legislation in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.788" offset="3563938">But last term in Goldstein against California, this Court refused to find such an effect in the constitutional provision which is identical with respect to copyrights and patents, and refused to find it as to a matter not covered by the patent law as enacted by -- by the copyright law as enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.503" offset="3670727">And we submit that the same conclusion should be reached here with respect to the impact of the patent laws on the state law of trade secrets.</text>

            <text syncTime="961.984" offset="3924637">Our position is that we are dealing with a trade secret which we are seeking to enforce through ordinary equitable principles which is in no way inconsistent with a patent and is not a functional equivalent of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.790" offset="3975941">Although of course it is in -- has a related -- it is in a related field dealing with what might be broadly called industrial property.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.344" offset="4034142">There is nothing in the patent law which expressly requires preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.104" offset="4061205">As a matter of fact, state trade secret law has coexisted with the patent law in this country for more than a century without interfering with anything that Congress has written in the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.012" offset="4116793">Trade secrets have been clearly established in Ohio at least since the decision of then Superior Court Judge Taft in the case of Cincinnati Bell Foundry against Dodds, decided in 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.169" offset="4177398">This Court has many times recognized the existence and validity of trade secrets in its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.045" offset="4208953">We have cited several of these cases in our brief and many more are cited in the numerous amicus briefs which have been filed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.669" offset="4247406">In the Dubilier Condenser case, this Court said that the inventor and I quote, “May keep his invention secret” and that didn’t mean just keep it to himself because it went on to say, “And reap its fruits indefinitely.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.215" offset="4317623">These decisions were outstanding and unqualified when the patent law was completely overhauled by Congress in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.833" offset="4356075">There is nothing in the statute which indicates any disapproval by Congress of the continuing validity of the law of trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.949" offset="4408529">Moreover, this Court recognized the validity of trade secrets in the rules of civil procedure which were adopted in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.661" offset="4443429">And Congress has both before and since 1952, enacted many statutes which recognized the continuing validity of the state law of trade secrets, these statutes both before and after 1952 are cited in appendices B and C of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.828" offset="4568085">The issue which we see here I think can be put in this way, Congress could no doubt by its action preempt the state law of trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.928" offset="4640496">Congress has taken no such action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.393" offset="4662335">The pressure in that direction comes from several decisions of this Court all dealing with other factual situations and not involving trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.748" offset="4723775">In this connection, I would like to call the attention of the Court to an article which is cited in our brief by Professor Widick of the University of California at Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.873" offset="4784274">When we cited it we had it only in manuscript, but I am now advised that it has been published in the December 1973 issue of the journal of the Patent Office Society, 55 journal of the Patent Office Society, 736.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.526" offset="4866821">That issue publishes only the first half of the article, the second half will be in the January issue and I will lodge copy of the entire article with the clerk so that it will be available for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.487" offset="4934740">Now, it said that the trade secrets in this case are invalid because the petitioner has lost his right to get a patent on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.049" offset="4988970">The argument is based on Section 102 (b) of the patent law which is set out on page 3 of our brief, just above the middle which reads that a person shall be entitled to a patent 'B' -- patent unless 'B' the invention was in public use in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.130" offset="5117283">What this says is that where the idea has been in public use for a year, no patent may be obtained and of course we don’t contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.989" offset="5164722">It may well be that Harshaw has lost its right to obtain a patent on any of these trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.539" offset="5190949">However, Harshaw is not claiming under the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.105" offset="5209130">It does not seek a monopoly against the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.210" offset="5225639">It seeks only to invoke the traditional function of equity to provide protection against breach of contract or violation of fiduciary responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.076" offset="5277048">Some of the arguments against us in this respect seem to beg the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.399" offset="5302335">Thus, in the amicus brief filed on behalf of SCM Corporation, it is said on page 13 that the petitioner’s rights are and I quote, “Forfeited to the public by commercial use in excess of one year, coupled with failure to file a time;y patent application.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.166" offset="5385404">And there are similar statements near the top of pages 18 and 19 and elsewhere in that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.846" offset="5416124">Now, of course if the petitioner’s rights have been forfeited, then it has no rights remaining and can get no relief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.387" offset="5454263">However, that is not what the statute says nor is there any basis for reading the statute to reach such a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.551" offset="5490939">What the statute says is that a person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention has been in public use for more than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.517" offset="5526779">The only appropriate conclusion from the language is that the right to obtain the patent is gone after one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.789" offset="5555931">There’s nothing in the statute to support the contention that the petitioner forfeited to the public under the patent laws every right available to it, including the protection of long and traditionally made available rights, extended by courts of equity against breach of contract or violation of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.361" offset="5650181">The court below and the respondents here rely heavily on this Court’s decisions in 1964 in Sears, Roebuck and Company against Stiffel Company and Compco Corp. against Day-Brite Lighting Company, both in 376 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.673" offset="5727399">Those cases seem to us to be clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.958" offset="5744536">They did not involve trade secrets nor did they involve any threatened breach of contract or violation of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.417" offset="5782465">Both have some rather sweeping language applied to other facts, but which may well not be properly applicable on the facts involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.532" offset="5822903">Both of the cases involved lamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.360" offset="5834188">In each case, a design patent had been obtained on the lamp and in each case the design patent had been held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.135" offset="5869296">There was of course nothing secret about the lamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.689" offset="5883507">They were sold to the public, and they and their design were available for inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.806" offset="5907958">They could be photographed and detailed drawings could be made of the designs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.236" offset="5929691">What the Illinois Court did in each case was to hold that the plaintiff whose design patent had been held invalid could nevertheless obtain in Mr. Justice Black’s words in the Sears opinion, “The equivalent of a patent monopoly on its unpatented lamp.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.606" offset="6015164">It’s obvious of course that such an injunction by the Illinois Court was the function, only equivalent of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.664" offset="6055393">It would be effective against anybody who sought to make the lamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.986" offset="6080679">The relief obtained was as wide and as broad as the protection under a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.584" offset="6103040">It did not depend in any way on breach of contract or violation of a fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.891" offset="6132297">It applied to anyone who sought to make and market a copy of the lamp, despite the fact that the design patent had been held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.003" offset="6176810">Now this Court did recognize in the opinion in the case by Mr. Justice Black that it was not foreclosing all relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.598" offset="6215158">It indicated that if there was evidence of passing off that the Court could require a labeling and otherwise designating the source of the particular lamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.745" offset="6279732">But here the respondents are not seeking to utilize material which is known to the public, or otherwise in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.400" offset="6314318">On the contrary, the respondents are personally bound by contract and by fiduciary relationship not to disclose what has been communicated to them in confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.375" offset="6370220">There is of course an interrelation between the patent law and the law of trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.236" offset="6397701">This has been known to the profession, to businessmen, to this Court and to Congress for a great many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.535" offset="6426854">Some of the briefs, including particularly two of the amicus briefs present effects -- arguments to the effect that the economy would be better served by reducing the protection which has long been granted to trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.504" offset="6486727">These are arguments on which Congress has never acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.086" offset="6505117">They are essentially legislative arguments calling for a change in the law in this area and it has -- as it has long been known and understood, and as Congress has written it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.562" offset="6563004">In the constitutional field, it may well be that the court should sit to some extent as a continuing constitutional convention bringing about changes in the interpretation of the constitution from time to time, since no one else has power to authenticate the effect of new developments and new undertakings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.716" offset="6651611">But there is no reason for this Court to sit as a continuing legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.979" offset="6672614">Congress is almost continued -- continually in session and it has undoubted power not only to enact a patent law, but also to determine the impact of the patent law on the state law of trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.769" offset="6731860">Many of the arguments presented in support of the decision below are essentially legislative arguments and should be presented to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.844" offset="6768118">The fact is of course, that Congress has never taken any explicit action which affects the state law of trade secrets and on the contrary it has on many occasions, both before and after the enactment of the patent code of 1952 and in the patent code of 1952, recognized the existence and continuing validity of trade secrets as they have long existed, and under the laws of the several states pursuant to the traditional doctrines of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.699" offset="6891520">For example, in the patent code itself, Congress provided that patent application should be kept secret so that if a patent is eventually denied, the applicant still has whatever protection he is entitled to from the trade secret.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.571" offset="7855020">And I also call the Court’s attention to the title of this injunction that says, “Order for permanent injunction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.570" offset="7886994">Now, the -- there was no award of damages by the District Court and the action of the Court of Appeals was to reverse the District Court and remand for a dismissal of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.413" offset="7954390">The action of the Court of Appeals appears at page 26 of the petitioner’s -- the appendix to the petition for their writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.478" offset="7998694">Now, still going to the -- if I may, Your Honors, refer to the decision of the Court of Appeals and it’s at page A7 of the certiorari petition where the Sixth Circuit characterized the issue that it felt was in front of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.963" offset="8064627">And the Sixth Circuit said, “Therefore, the issue presented to this court in the instant case maybe summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.497" offset="8094720">Whether a state trade secret law which protects an invention which would be an appropriate subject for a patent under the patent laws of the United States and which has been used commercially for more than one year conflicts with the policies and purposes of Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution and the patent laws adopted pursuant thereto.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.790" offset="8187925">Now, this is the last thing I’ll read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.784" offset="8199837">If I may go back to page 6 of the appendix also in the same Sixth Circuit opinion, the -- this is setting up their question, the Sixth Circuit says, “We must determine whether the trade secret laws of the State of Ohio are required to be struck down in this case as being in conflict with the United States patent laws, and if so, to what extent?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.536" offset="8298893">Kewanee urges that the issue presented to this Court requires a determination as to whether the enforcement of any and all state trade secret laws conflict with the policy of the United States patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.190" offset="8349466">Thus framed, we consider the issue too broad for our consideration in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.076" offset="8373081">Now, as we have set out in our brief, we say the issue is a permanent injunction granted by a District Court as to subject matter, the trade secret subject matter, in conflict with the patent laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.140" offset="12825287">First, that there is a strong federal policy favoring the full and free use of ideas in the public domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.456" offset="13094557">The application of state law in these cases to prevent the copying of articles which did not meet the requirements for a federal protection disturbed the careful balance which Congress had drawn, and thereby necessarily gave way under the supremacy cause of the Constitution.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4035.555" offset="16219011">Well, no Your Honor, but the concept of the lamp case was that there was a design patent involved there, I believe and the Illinois, I mean the courts in Illinois said, “That’s an invalid patent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.957" offset="16288601">So therefore, there was no protection under the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.788" offset="16303856">But then the court turned around and said, “But we’ll give protection under Illinois unfair competition laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.275" offset="16329874">And I would go back to the language I quoted from your Goldstein decision, and that -- and I am saying that the Supreme Courts -- and the Congress has said, “This is a patentable subject matter and anything that’s outside that, in the number (ph) or whatever you want to call it, that people can use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.117" offset="16413257">Your Honor, I see my time is up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.070" offset="16425064">I do -- I -- may I read very briefly this patent fee borne language in that case where a decision was a -- it’s relied upon substantially by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.774" offset="16475847">I want to talk -- say that about two thirds down on the second column at page 225, the Court clearly cuts itself out from the injunction concept that we’re discussing now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.514" offset="16522762">The -- this is the majority opinion, the decision there, it says, “Provisions against competition not utilizing the secret after expiration of agreement are a different matter which must be judged on their own facts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.669" offset="16567380">And I think that’s the case we’re at.</text>

            <text syncTime="4309.822" offset="17316049">And from that, those three Justices reached the conclusion that Congress had occupied the field and that there was no room for a state statute in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.107" offset="17369130">There is nothing comparable to that with respect to the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.659" offset="17395357">And then with respect to Mr. Justice White’s question, I should have been quicker in bringing to your attention that the statute, the Patent Office statute is printed in full in our brief, Title 35, Section 122 is in the appendix at page 6 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.597" offset="17495144">Application for patent shall be kept in confidence and so on and then on page 3 (a) is the Patent Office regulation which that statute puts into statutory language.</text>
