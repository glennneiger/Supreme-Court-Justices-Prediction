            <text syncTime="1773.651" offset="7171344">This is the same map which was shown a moment ago by Mr. Coker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.701" offset="7191510">It shows the subject land being in section three which is over a mile distance from the Colorado River as it was surveyed under this topographic map.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.745" offset="7239680">I would like to point out, in your looking at this, that the Colorado River in the stage that it was at the time of that survey was a low stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.554" offset="7294955">It wasn’t the river as it existed in an annual high flow stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.074" offset="7317002">For perhaps familiar already, the Colorado River is a river that traditionally before the days of Boulder dam drained the water shed of the Colorado and when it did, it ran in the late spring and the early summer months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.553" offset="7382936">So the only period of time that that river really had a high flow stage was during that particular part of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.078" offset="7409058">Any other time it was rather a docile river and sometimes had very low water in it and all of the surveys that I know anything about were done at the time the river was low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.779" offset="7459840">And so you see on exhibit K that’s on page five of respondent’s brief, an approximate location of that low flow but you see also to the right of the subject land a 500-foot to 550-foot contour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.763" offset="7527758">And for showing it on this big map, the 550-foot contour is clear off in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.227" offset="7717616">Now, this was 1906 and in relation to Mr. Justice White’s argument about whether it was riparian or not, I would just say that this is the closest date we have to determine whether it was a riparian land.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.916" offset="8160444">There is no doubt that that river has run over all of that area at some time.</text>
