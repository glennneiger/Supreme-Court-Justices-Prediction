            <label>Mr. James V. Ryan</label>
            <text syncTime="19.328" offset="154018">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.729" offset="171677">This case is before the court on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals to the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.162" offset="193411">I represent the petitioner defendants Bangor Putna Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.853" offset="212114">Bangor Putna is a publicly owned, manufacturing concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.721" offset="227683">The respondent plaintiffs are the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad and its wholly on subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.209" offset="249626">The Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad operates the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.957" offset="260598">It's trackage is exclusively within the state of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.027" offset="276898">The issue before this Court to day is may uninjured party, by using the device of the cooperate form while claiming to vindicate an inchoate public interest maintain an action in the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.983" offset="336666">Now this action was commence by the filing of a complaint in the district court in Maine in December of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.188" offset="365505">Although, the complaint contains 13 causes of action, allegedly based on violations of the securities laws, the antitrust laws, Maine Statutes and the Common law, essentially its based upon four inter company transactions which occurred between Bangor Punta the petitioner here and the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad, the nominal plaintiff here while Bangor Punta -- while the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad was a 98% owned subsidiary of Bangor Punta.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.102" offset="493192">Although, the claims as I say allege various violation of Federal statutes, as Judge Gnew (ph) and the District Court has stated or properly characterized them, they are claims which are typical stockholders claims, seeking and accounting for alleged misappropriation and waste of cooperate assets by controlling shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.723" offset="579605">Now after the filing of the complaint and the filing of the answer, the petitioner Bangor Punta moved for summary judgment, based upon the admissions in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.698" offset="623491">The District court on settled principles of law granted the motion and held that the nominal plaintiff here, the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad Company and the real party in interest here Amoskeag Corporation which purchase the 99% owned interest of Bangor Punta and the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad are barred from maintaining this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.261" offset="725786">On appeal to the First Circuit, this decision was unanimously reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.913" offset="748356">Although the First Circuit agreed with the District Court and said that these are essentially stockholders' claims and in a normal corporate situation, a dismissal would have been proper in this case because a Railroad was involved which the Court of Appeals characterized as being a public corporation, a separate inchoate undefined interest of the public was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.839" offset="852114">This interest of the public which was held and stated to be an interest in the financial health of the BAR provided a legally recognizable and separate interest which was served by this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.866" offset="984189">No not at holding the Court of Appeals do not know sir, no excuse me I misunderstood your complaint, your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.339" offset="1006132">No the Maine court said that this action could be maintained even the State Court, actually a State Court claims because of this separable interest and there is no Maine law which supports that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.479" offset="1074678">As Judge of Gnew noted his opinion BAR did not claim in its complaint that there was any public interest or any rights of any creditor is involved in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.584" offset="1119086">Nor did the BAR before the Court of Appeals had indicated that they were suing vindicate any specific public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.654" offset="1159314">Even before to this Court, they do not allege or state that they are vindicating any specific public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.018" offset="1192856">What they say is, is that a railroad is a public asset and because a railroad is a public asset the normal rules of law do not apply to this situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.447" offset="1246563">Now the facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.109" offset="1261192">In 1960 the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad Corporation caused the predecessor and interest of Bangor Punta to be formed and then by a registered exchange offer the shareholders of the railroad became the shareholders of the parent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.702" offset="1319602">This was the holding company trend which was the vogue in Railroads during the late 50s and early 60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.874" offset="1348232">So that at the end of the transaction, the railroad became a 99% subsidiary of the parent holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.008" offset="1400790">The actions on which the complaint are based and which complaint claims are unlawful, all occurred between 1960 and 1967 and as judge of Gnew stated they are essentially claims of corporate place, that a controlling shareholder mismanaged the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.866" offset="1492219">Now on October 2, 1969 the Bangor Punta sold its 99% interest in the BAR to Amoskeag which is again a public corporation with public stockholders the interest in the railroad for five million dollars in cash and December of 1971 this law suite was started.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.806" offset="1611964">Now as the District Court pointed out there are three flaws really controlling facts which are dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.806" offset="1648013">First of all the real party here, the real party in interest is Amoskeag.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.496" offset="1666717">Amoskeag owns 99% of this railroad and they are not claiming to be suing to vindicate the seven-tenths of 1% of private shareholders, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.366" offset="1710184">Number two, Amoskeag does not claim that it was defrauded or it was misled by anything that Bangor Punta stated, or that is got less than it paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.964" offset="1760653">Amoskeag purchased the stock from the wrong doer, alleged wrong doer after the acts occurred and does not state that it suffered any specific injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.331" offset="1806106">What it is attempting to do by this action is obtain a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.654" offset="1823347">It is up to -- it is suing to recover its purchase price of five million dollars plus an additional two million dollars windfall and still keep the railroad and yet it doesn't state that it was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.870" offset="1880189">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="451.508" offset="1882802">If the action is border in the name of the corporation not in the name of Amoskeag you say that Amoskeag gets the real party in interest but originally you do not look behind a corporate plaintiffs to see who the stockholders are in order to determine who are the real party in interest is, do you?</text>

            <text syncTime="468.311" offset="1949989">I think the answer to that is yes, generally that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.603" offset="1963154">A corporation is a legal person for purposes of maintaining suits owning property and we are doing various acts, however, in this case here the claims are essentially stockholder claims, essentially equitable claims and If you do not --</text>

            <text syncTime="491.436" offset="2042462">Well, it's difficult for me to understand how one can say that a 99% shareholder or affect you can violate rules of law regarding a subsidiary person strictly injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.118" offset="2121247">In another words if they were a creditor to here or if there was some other person who claims injury then I would say that you can't look behind the corporate wall, but that is not this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.957" offset="2672536">If the relief would result in what is characterized in the the case as an unjustified windfall well then a court of equity in derivative action would be able to be frame decree accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.890" offset="2720287">It will depend upon the facts of this specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.865" offset="2732199">I don't think you can make a blanket rule, but certainly in this case where you have 99% there is no question that there is a windfall here and there is a no question that a court a frame a decree in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.137" offset="2805342">Now as I say that if you eliminate the public interest or claimed public interest which I'll deal with next then it seems that the reasoning of Judge Gnew which was really agreed to by the First Circuit that in the ordinary corporate case the dismissal of Judge Gnew would have been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.668" offset="2887471">Rule 23.1 would have been prevented Amoskeag from suing itself and that the general equitable principles prevent Amoskeag through the guise of the corporate form to maintain this action on behalf of itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.627" offset="3011291">I would have to say I do think it would, but I don't -- you don't have to reach that point in this case because in this case you have Amoskeag standing here who is the real party of interest, alleging essentially equitable claims and just a court should not permit Amoskeag to be unjustly enriched by using the device of the corporate form unless there is a some other public interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.581" offset="3111079">Now what is this public interest which is where the First Circuit departed from judge Gnew.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.936" offset="3140441">The First Circuit says that there is not easily defined a point applies inchoate interest in the public, in the financial health of Railroads and that this interest is the basis for maintaining this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.807" offset="3212016">The respondents go even further and they say that a Railroad is a public asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.024" offset="3232810">Well Your Honor, we submit that a Railroad is a private business corporation with certain clearly defined public duties and obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.787" offset="3267918">The Interstate Commerce -- Congress through the Interstate Commerce Act in various legislations over the last 50 or 60 years has clearly defined those areas in which there are the interest of the public are covered and there is also some residual minor common law responsibilities of Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.319" offset="3342002">There is no claim in this complaint or anywhere they raise that Bangor Punta violated any of these Statuary rules or regulations regarding Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.742" offset="3391739">On the contrary, the Interstate Commerce Commission acknowledges that there is apparently a gap in this regulation and this gap is what they are asking this Court to really rectify the cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.662" offset="3455373">Now this gap, what I this gap?</text>
            <text syncTime="847.758" offset="3467807">This gap is that is that a holding company in the late 50's and early 60's holding companies were formed and operated subsidiary Railroads as wholly owned subsidiaries and this of course everybody is familiar with Penn Central that was not a very successful, but we had other successful one Union Specific, just as there are number of network out.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.363" offset="3566237">Now first of all in this case there is no allegation in this complaint that the Bangor &amp; Aroostook can barely survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.836" offset="3600091">On the contrary the Bangor &amp; Aroostook is a viable Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.076" offset="3617019">It is earning money, it is paying dividends, it is paying off its debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.905" offset="3636349">It is one of the only Railroads in the North-East that really, probably East of the Mississippi other than the Chesapeake (ph) that is still paying dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.915" offset="3668428">So it's hardly a Railroad which has suffered the deprivations of a pirate who has looted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.069" offset="3697058">Secondly, over the last 60 years, Congress has repeatedly addressed to itself to railroads' operation, public interest in railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.455" offset="3730599">It has provided a numerous remedies not only by administrative but also by private actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.164" offset="3765394">The legislators of course do not indemnify somebody who can he has been injured under one of the statuary requirements and this is not covered as it's conceded by the ICC and by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.648" offset="3839373">Now is it for this Court to create this remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="945.494" offset="3858704">We say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.820" offset="3864033">This -- the railroad is a regulated industry, highly regulated industry and it should not be for a court to provide new remedies beyond what Congress says are really in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.323" offset="3914083">But thirdly, and more importantly this very and I will call it a problem of parents, parent companies, holding companies with subsidiary railroads has been the subject of congressional hearings and there are presently pending legislation in Congress which addresses itself to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.911" offset="3992346">Now should this Court step forward and go ahead of Congress? Congress has this very problem before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.016" offset="4028813">Now it's interesting to note that even with the legislation in front of congress which has been there for four years and has not been enacted, so perhaps this problem of holding companies is not quite as severe or as evil as some people would like to pretend, they have enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.426" offset="4102478">This specific legislation doesn't even cover our situation here because the legislation provides that the before the ICC can intervene the service to the public in Maine from the BAR has to be tracking and there is no allegation here and there can be no allegation here that anything that my client did threatened the public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.415" offset="4198400">So that when you come all away back down to what really on the bottom line is that there really isn't an identifiable public interest which can be injured, which can give rise to jurisdiction or standing in a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.082" offset="4261094">Now, when you get past that point you come to the really -- the really bottom line is that Amoskeag here has not been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.192" offset="4309473">It has not suffered any injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.181" offset="4321489">If this general public somewhere that may have suffered an injury, but it has not suffered an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.111" offset="4349179">It is not a proper party, plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.507" offset="4358792">Someone out there may be able to maintain an action, but it is not the Amoskeag through the device of the Corporate form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.881" offset="4396304">Now they argue, Your Honor, that well they can frame a decree and that there is a recovery here that is going to be some public benefit because some of the money might stick in the Bangor &amp; Aroostook railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.099" offset="4449176">Well of course that is really as Court of Appeals recognized is really can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.411" offset="4470387">It's absurd, cash is fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.380" offset="4478224">You put cash into a corporation, it can come out at the other end in all kinds of ways as long as it's solvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.926" offset="4504451">If it is solvent it can legally as any business corporation pay dividends and until somebody says a solvent corporation can't pay dividends then how are you going stop the money from coming out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.588" offset="4555128">True you could probably put a District Judge in there to run this railroad for 20 years and somehow put all the stops in, but that's certainly not something that a court should do, particularly when the railroad is solvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.527" offset="4606851">For that reason, Your Honor, we feel this case should be (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.610" offset="4663171">As we view the case, there are two questions involved in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.380" offset="4682292">The first is whose lawsuit is this in the first place?</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.246" offset="4697757">Is it the railroad's lawsuit or is it Amoskeag's lawsuit, the present controlling stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.592" offset="4723148">I think the record is clear and I will highlight it in just a moment that it is indeed the railroad's lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.515" offset="4750838">The second question is assuming that it is the Railroad's lawsuit, if the railroad makes a substantial recovery in the lawsuit, will this inure to the benefit of its present controlling stockholder Amoskeag in such a way that the windfall “that Amoskeag  may enjoy outweigh the benefits of permitting the railroad to right the wrongs which have been done.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.093" offset="4917081">Yes sir, I think the record well illustrates the fact that the present owners of the Railroad Amoskeag are engaged in the process of developing a Northern New England Rail system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.156" offset="4973401">Amoskeag presently owns 35% of Maine Central Railroad stock which is held in voting trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.716" offset="4999628">It owns 99% of the Bangor &amp; Aroostook stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.493" offset="5014674">It is the largest single holder of the first mortgage bonds of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad presently in re-organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.869" offset="5048216">What Amoskeag is trying to do, subject to the supervision of the commission, is to put together a Northern New England System which I suggest at least on the face of it solves some of the problems of the Railroads by unifying a number of short carriers to build into the larger system which maybe in fact coming out of Conrail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.581" offset="5167020">I can say this to this Court, I know that they have a moral obligation and I believe that properly supervised by the District Court within midge (ph) of the decree that those funds could be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.737" offset="5211742">Indeed as we suggest in our brief, Amoskeag and the Railroad are both prepared to enter into some kind of meaningful order by a District Court should there be a recovery in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.285" offset="5253851">So that those funds could be used, let's say, for the system or if not for the system, to be put into maintenance of way and maintenance of equipment to build a stronger railroad which can better serve the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.515" offset="5302857">True, as my brother states, it doesn't look as though the Bangor &amp; Aroostook is in problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.781" offset="5323860">That maybe because good management took care of this after the Railroad was sold and I think if you look in the Appendix to our Brief on the report of the bureau of accounts, you will see some indication of the beneficial management of this Railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1791.105" offset="7241143">What I would like to point out is the directors of this corporation had before them in the July of 1971, a report from the Bureau of Accounts, Interstate Commerce Commission, which had been made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.800" offset="7296000">And that had said, “We recommend that all legal remedies be explored to require the holding company which sold the carrier to pay back to the carrier for assets taken, with no compensation, and charges made where no services were performed” and the Interstate Commerce Commission as they point out in their brief simply couldn't do anything of about this, they had no jurisdiction over one Railroad holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.019" offset="7412820">They had no jurisdiction over the transfer of assets, from one corporate affiliate to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.056" offset="7436957">So if a director of the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad at that time saw that statement in the Bureau of Accounts report as they did, in July of 1971, what were they supposed to do to discharge their fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.912" offset="7500382">As a matter of fact, as the record points out a majority of the board, of the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad in July of 1971 were members of the prior board, the board which had sat, while these assets where being taken away unbeknownst to them, presumably and a majority of that number actually voted to bring this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.822" offset="7588049">So it was not a case where Amoskeag walked in, changed the entire Board of Directors and said now, let see what we can do, to get back what was taken out of this corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.473" offset="7790655">I think that in these situations where you are making sales, as we tried to point out in our brief, the usual question is, what are these properties worth and what would be savings that will be accomplished if you are putting railroads together or flatten out the earnings projection so that you get not a one time profit, but a realization of what the railroad on a day-to-day base is worth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.750" offset="8527726">That is the real party in interest, even though shareholder here has asked that a derivative suit be brought, the real party in interest is Amoskeag and therefore there can't be any recovery beyond the one percent, based on the Headley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.811" offset="8591987">We suggest to this Court that Headley case really isn't controlling under such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.802" offset="8615915">That if a derivative action were to commence now, the better rule would be to allow the corporation to recover fully, for what have been done against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.131" offset="8657293">The affective going with judge Gnew who dismissed the entire action, is that nobody will ever be able to right the wrongs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.635" offset="8691252">Each time we'll be faced with the Rule 223.1 argument, because the court will say, pardon me Mr. Ryan in effect will say sorry this is a windfall to Amoskeag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.776" offset="8739840">The Headley case controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.169" offset="8749453">In fact it seems to us that this being the kind of corporation that it is, a Railroad with the strong public interest, that shouldn't be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.552" offset="8786965">Somebody ought to be able to recover for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.515" offset="8842762">I think basically those are the -- that is the essence of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.403" offset="8862407">First, that this is unquestionably the Railroad suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.854" offset="8876199">It was brought by the Railroad's directors in response to the Bureau of Accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.681" offset="8899500">The ICC could do nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.596" offset="8907128">Bureau of Accounts report said that the directors of the corporation to do something and in discharging their fiduciary duties a lawsuit was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.240" offset="8945685">The real question then, I don't think there is any question about who is bringing the suit, the real question then is, is the windfall argument going to out pace the argument which says that this Railroad ought to be able to right the wrongs that it was done to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.840" offset="9004095">We earnestly submit to this Court that the answer ought to be allow this Railroad because it is a Railroad to bring this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.361" offset="9038158">Things can be done if there is a recovery to ensure to a great degree that any recovery will be used for the benefit of the public, by strengthening the Railroad, by allowing it to give better service to those who it does serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.103" offset="9105136">Thank you very much.</text>
