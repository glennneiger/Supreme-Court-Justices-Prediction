            <text syncTime="18.043" offset="148898">When we closed yesterday, I was about to say that I thought the Snyder Act when well summed up by Mr. Wolf who at earlier stage was a counsel in this case, which he described the Act in Law Review article this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.893" offset="208353">He said the Snyder Act is familiar in somewhat distressing occurrence in the history of Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.358" offset="230191">As in other instances, Congress enacted a very general measure and left the rest up to the Secretary of the Interior and the BIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.678" offset="263419">I think that is what the Snyder Act did do, except I would have one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.317" offset="282018">It also left the rest up to future Congresses in their appropriations procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.059" offset="308976">Now, in all recent years including the appropriations for fiscal year 1968, which are at issue here, the Secretary of the Interior has submitted to the Congress request for funds or welfare program for Indians in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.694" offset="383478">General assistance will be provided to needy Indians on reservations who are not eligible for public assistance under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.251" offset="429767">Each year Congress has published that language in its reports in favor of the bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.521" offset="546795">I think it is just simply correct that this statement that has been made to the Congress is a compact and too abbreviated statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.753" offset="587755">It should say for Indians on reservations and in the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Oklahoma and Alaska.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.343" offset="674168">Well, in Oklahoma the reason is following.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.743" offset="691722">That the whole section of the State of Oklahoma was once Indian territory and was totally occupied with Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.153" offset="721398">Well, the second part of this what I am getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.247" offset="737698">The reservations have been abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.725" offset="747624">The tribal organizations have not been abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.938" offset="760477">The Indians there live on trust property and with a good deal of property still managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs such as in the Mason case that we had last year and the Bureau's interpretation of that has been that the lands that it administers in Oklahoma are equivalent to --</text>

            <text syncTime="213.013" offset="928810">The Bureau of Indian Affairs has also made this interpretation of the statute that where there Indians living on trust land that's administered by the agency near a reservation, they simply treat that as if it were on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.283" offset="1009894">In other words, they haven't been as rigid in saying that if your off reservation, there is absolutely nothing as one might hope for a mechanical application of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.861" offset="1072170">What they have said is in the Turtle Mountain incidence -- they've simply equated administratively people living on trust land, allotted land.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.593" offset="1291076">If an Indian lives on a reservation or near a reservation, and he cannot get a job and he wants to go somewhere else to look for a job, the Bureau will try to find him a job and will provide him general assistance for several years when he first begins to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.635" offset="1631295">These are “"on or near" reservations” and I thought a lot a modern service bureau, serving as many as 400,000 Indians in Alaska, natives who live "on or near" reservations, people will find themselves isolated from the mainstream of the American lives?</text>

            <text syncTime="423.943" offset="1772565">What I am saying is that in the Health Program that quite openly is for Indians who live "on or near" reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.504" offset="1802762">In this work relocation program, it's for the benefit of Indians who live "on or near" reservations, but it's actually put into effect even quite distant from a reservation, in some city where there maybe employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.115" offset="1865247">So I am not arguing that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is precluded or doesn’t, in fact, give assistance to Indians off-reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.529" offset="1906834">What I am saying is that in their general welfare program, this general assistance program that year after year they have asked Congress for money for this program, for activities on reservation, maybe they should have described it a little broader and that they are all -- that Congress has appropriated with that in mind and has appropriated sums of money that only fit for that definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.677" offset="2091468">I think what's really happening is I think -- I think you have to isolate the Alaska and Oklahoma situation as special situations, but then apart from that I think that the Bureau of Indian Affairs will try to make as broad a definition of on reservation as they can, and that where there has been trust land involved in a few instances, and I know this is so, people of Bureau of Indian Affairs told me so just last week and so that they have in some instances have given welfare to people who live on trust land, near the reservations in situations where the reservation was too small for the allotments to have been made on the reservation, and the Government found land for people off-reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.488" offset="2286655">But they have not extended that to people who do not live on trust land and thus are not under the direct supervision of the Bureau in that respect.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="566.612" offset="2343184">You draw a line that the Bureau has generally between Indians on trust lands and Indians on allotted lands?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="574.861" offset="2376202">Well, when I say trust land, I am not drawing a distinction between that and alloted land.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.577" offset="2403056">I mean, land in which the Federal Government is still the trustee, whether it's because the Indian had an allotment and doesn’t yet own the land and fee or for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.946" offset="2472542">Now I think it is clear that Congress has not appropriated money for its broader program as the petitioners ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.344" offset="2534087">I want to point out also that even the and I mean respondent asks for, I want to point out also that even the respondents say that they don't suggest that the program should be made available to Indians throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.572" offset="2599079">That at page 23 of their Brief they say we have never argued that the Government is required to provide the subsistence benefits to the fully assimilated Indian residing in Manhattan.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.728" offset="2643696">So if you don't use the boundary, the line that the Congress and the Bureau has set up, some other line has to be ticked and I don't think that the line “on or near” reservations is going to get any more satisfactory judicial answer to this question than the line that has been drawn now on reservations in these two special instances of Alaska and Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.802" offset="2771905">Now, I want to say a word that Bureau of Indian Affairs (Inaudible) on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.901" offset="2788310">I would feel easier with this case if the Bureau of Indian Affairs had published its manual in the Federal Registers because I think what they have done -- I don't think they had a duty to have rule making public notice in open hearings because this is for benefits and so forth and there have been cases that it tell it's not necessary there.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.587" offset="2879112">But I think to have these be real legislative rules, that they would have had they been published in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.687" offset="2911504">What the BIA Actually did is publish in the Federal Register a notice that it has in this manual and it's available to the public at the Washington Office and at the Regional offices of the BIA which is something like a substantial compliance, but I don't say that it really is compliance with that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.362" offset="2994155">So we are left with the rules simply as interpretations of the acts of Congress and I think they are correct interpretations in the sense that this is all that the Bureau asked for money for and this is all that the appropriations gave the money for.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.984" offset="3060715">So when the Bureau's regulations say this for welfare of Indians on reservations and in Alaska and Oklahoma, I think it's just same with the Congressional acts have be read to say anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.805" offset="3115990">But the Court disagrees on that, I think that these Congressional acts are so vague and that the discretion left to the Bureau is so large, both in the Snyder Act and then other legislation and then the general language of the Appropriation Act which is just general appropriation, that the Bureau does have rule making authority here, and that if it did go through the process of publishing these rules, it would be based with the problem then whether that made the same program valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="941.179" offset="3841463">If you want to accept that the reservation or that this situation in Alaska or Oklahoma is legitimate jurisdictional kind of distinction to make then the fact that if someone leaves the jurisdiction, he gives up certain welfare benefits is not an interference with his right of travel anymore than leaving one County and going to another is if one county has a broader welfare program than another.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.965" offset="3956611">On non-general assistance, the welfare programs often breakdown to county by county.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.789" offset="3975941">I think what it is, the Government is seeing a serious problem of unemployment on reservations where it has the greatest responsibility, if the Government reacting properly to that problem, setting up a program, but if the Government simply not setting up program that goes beyond the heart area of its responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.896" offset="4064340">Now, I think it might have been a wise decision for Bureau Of Indian Affairs to have a broader program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.831" offset="4088059">I don't argue for the merits of their decision to try to limit this program or there have been Acts passed -- Acts presented to Congress, it would have provided some broader programs and the Bureau has not supported them and Congress has not passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.064" offset="4169038">I do simply say that I think constitutionally, this is within the area of cases such as Dandridge that there is no invidious discrimination here, that the difference is based on an essential jurisdictional difference and whatever the wisdom of the decision that Congress and the BIA have made, it's legitimately their decision to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.371" offset="4306233">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.295" offset="4317936">My name is Winton Woods, counsel for the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.205" offset="4333610">I would, at the outset, like to clear up what seem to me yesterday to be apparent misunderstanding about our basic position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.216" offset="4377600">First I think we need to be very clear about what it is that we are talking about when we talk about general assistance sponsored by the Bureau Of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.608" offset="4415216">It is in fact a supplemental program that is available only to needy Indians who do not qualify for one of the categorical programs under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.691" offset="4463491">Those programs are generally run by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.016" offset="4476761">The GA program is run by the BIA for the benefit of Indians who Congress has determined by virtue of their very special status in American life, are worthy of some special consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.400" offset="4542380">With that in mind I think, we are talking in this case not about discrimination between Indians and non-Indians, but about discrimination between differing groups of Indians, between those Indians who do receive the BIA general assistance and those who do not receive BIA general assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.646" offset="4639347">Now, the Government has sought to characterize the holding of the Court below in the very broadest possible manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.620" offset="4671216">In fact, we think that the holding of the Court was quite narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.398" offset="4686367">If I might quote, the Court Of Appeals held, we hold that under the circumstances of this case, it was improper for the Bureau to deny General Assistance on the basis of residency alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.396" offset="4750315">Now there are two elements to that holding that I think need to be noted if the opinion of the Court below is to be properly understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.038" offset="4780931">First, the special circumstances that exist in this case and secondly, the very narrow automatic basis of the administrative decision to deny welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.713" offset="4831608">The respondents here, plaintiffs below, are full-blooded Papago Indians who are members their tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.267" offset="4861806">They are un-assimilated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.462" offset="4866612">They speak primarily the Papago language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.374" offset="4878211">They reside in a Papago community, 15 miles from their reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.680" offset="4899422">They are in every respect as the Stucki affidavit which is in the Appendix of Pages 84 and 87 demonstrate, Papago Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.606" offset="4935158">Moreover, they reside within the historic boundaries of their aboriginal land, land that the Indian Claims Commission has recently found was illegally taken from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.286" offset="4977894">And finally, there is no question on the record after the fair hearing in this case, that they are needy Indians within the intent of the Congressional legislation that's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.408" offset="5026377">Against that factual background, then the Bureau of Indian Affairs automatically determined that the respondents were not entitled to general assistance, solely on the basis of the fact of their residency, 15 miles from the reservation boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.396" offset="5094296">The result of that interpretation which in fact is not unusual is severe discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.090" offset="5125120">First, as Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out yesterday, a Papago miner who happened to live on the western edge of the reservation and thus was able to commute to the mines at Ajo would be entitled to general assistance if he needed it, while persons in the situation of the Ruizs, who come from South Komelik in the far southern part of the reservation, near the Mexican border, and thus who are unable to commute are forced to move into Indian village in Ajo in order to work if they are to find work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.811" offset="5251971">As we pointed out in our brief, there is very little work available on the Papago reservation. What can be found, generally has found in the bordering communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.791" offset="5291886">Secondly, and the Court has discussed this at some length with Mr. Sachse, there are some non-reservation Indians who receive general assistance benefits, regardless of the fact that they do not reside on the reservation, and we think that they are indistinguishable from the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.234" offset="5373701">The Government has suggested that there is some difference based upon the jurisdiction over the reservation, and yet the Government has admitted in their brief and in the petition for certiorari, that jurisdiction exists in this case, that the Bureau in fact has jurisdiction to extent benefits to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.882" offset="5456248">I think that we cannot assume on the basis of the legislative history that exists in this case that Congress intended that these strange and unusual results would come about when they approved this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.999" offset="5508702">We believe that the results violate congressional intent and that they also violate the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.276" offset="5541825">Our basic case then is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.793" offset="5555931">We believe that when Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior, through the Snyder Act to expend such moneys as they would appropriate in the future for the care and benefit of the Indians throughout the United States, and when they later in 1968, which is the Act in issue in this case, appropriated money pursuant to that mandate, that the plain language of those statutes does not allow the automatic or conclusive presumption, if you will, of non-eligibility that is based solely upon the place of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.410" offset="5706397">Now that's not to say that we believe that the statute mandates the payment of general assistance benefits to Indians throughout the United States, no matter where they may be found, no matter what their percentage of blood may be, no matter what their degree of assimilation may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.791" offset="5767941">We believe that the Secretary can and should protrude -- pursuant to the congressional mandate, create a carefully drawn regulation that draws the very line of Mr. Sachse was talking about, and that line can be drawn by focusing upon the worthy Indian both in the Snyder Act and in the Appropriations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.318" offset="5861982">A statute that defines or a regulation that defines who is an Indian, for purposes of those statutes might very well meet every conceivable objection that the Government has to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.188" offset="5917466">For example, the Bureau of Indian Affairs might conclude that an Indian -- well, that in defining an Indian, that they would look to things such as the degree of assimilation into the dominant culture, that they would look to such things as degree of blood.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.198" offset="6105548">Your Honor, I think that this case is quite distinguishable from the Dandridge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.491" offset="6126759">The Government consistently has suggested, that this is a Dandridge problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.595" offset="6155180">I read Dandridge, at least to say that this Court will not second-guess legislative judgments, a relative need between competing classes of welfare recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.541" offset="6206903">I don't believe that that's this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.738" offset="6215680">If we are to analogize this case to Dandridge versus Williams or Jefferson versus Hackney, I think we could hypothesize a situation, in which the State of Maryland which has jurisdiction over the entire state, chose to extend AFDC benefits only to mothers who live in Baltimore County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.626" offset="6303242">As you well remember from the facts that case, there was a discrimination in Dandridge between Baltimore County and the rest of the state and to the extent that families in Baltimore County received slightly more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.436" offset="6358518">I suspect that this case -- that this Court, apart from the Social Security Act issue, on constitutional grounds would have seen that case quite differently had Maryland said, we are only going to expend money for mothers in Baltimore County, without any factual showing, without any determination that that was a rational choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.538" offset="6650880">As a general proposition, it's quite clear that it does, and if this where an ordinary case, I would not be standing here, making the arguments that I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.683" offset="6687451">The fact is that, the Government over the course of years has told the Congress that it is expending money for the benefit of Indians who live “on or near” reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.824" offset="6748056">Now, there have been times, when various Senators, particularly Senator Bible in a colloquy this Court at length and the Court of Appeals spending attempted to find out, just exactly what the Bureau meant when it said “on or near.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.152" offset="6797375">The bureau has never adequately described to Congress, what the “on or near” language meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.903" offset="6824333">More over, they suggested the existence of this regulation should under the standard rule be taken to be an expression of congressional intent as Congress has not overridden it in anyway through the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.208" offset="6889535">I would agree again with that as a general proposition, but the fact of this case is, that pursuant to the policies established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs manual itself, that regulation is not for public consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.727" offset="6939690">It is a regulation designed for internal administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.963" offset="6956617">Those regulations that are designed to inform the public and presumably the Congress, are not contained in the Bureau of Indian Affairs manual alone, but they are put in CFR, and through the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.009" offset="7012833">This regulation is hidden away in a manual that is used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in handling its internal programs, and we simply don't believe that the standard, and I believe appropriate rule in regard to long-standing administrative regulations is applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.092" offset="7093081">Secondly, the Government points to the fact, that the appropriations request itself has always contained the limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.527" offset="7126831">We would suggest that the fact that Congress chose not to include the requested limitation in its appropriation is equal in argument for our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.152" offset="7173329">We might well assume, particularly following the Squire versus Capoeman standard of liberal construction for statute regarding Indian Affairs, we might very well assume that the failure of Congress to enact a regulation requested by the Bureau, is in fact a recognition of Congress' intent to not limit the program to the degree that the Bureau sought to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.475" offset="7354619">The Court of Appeals found and we think that there is substantial support for that finding that over the course of years, the Bureau has administered their program in a very sloppy way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.463" offset="7402580">That they have in fact extended benefits to Indians who do not reside on reservations even outside of Alaska and Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.884" offset="7436330">It has never been quite clear even in the legislative history which is cited in our brief just how far the Bureau has gone to extend benefits to near reservations Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.136" offset="7477290">The Court of Appeals found, however, and we think found correctly that they have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.553" offset="7498919">So that the in fact practice over the course of years differs greatly from the specific language of the regulation and we believe that it's appropriate for this Court not to look only or to look not only at the specific language of the regulation, but to look at -- look as well to the practice of the Bureau under that regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.184" offset="10201443">The facts of this case I would remind the Court are that the land upon which the respondents live, is land that was illegally taken from the Papago Tribe as found by the Indian Claims Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.170" offset="10253479">They reside within their historic aboriginal land and they have exercised their right and I have to admit that it is not a right that this Court has established, but I think that any fair reading of the right to travel cases, must conclude that an Indian has a right to travel particularly throughout his historic land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.182" offset="10345430">As we pointed out in our brief in the -- in our added statement, the statement made by the Government, there is very little work available on the reservation and thus travel around the reservation and to off-reservation communities becomes a matter of necessity of one is to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.729" offset="10415647">If Mr. Ruiz wanted to work in the mines, he had to move to Ajo and to live in Indian village since commuting from his village in the the southern part of the reservation was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.539" offset="10466952">He could have moved back, he could have moved back to the reservation as evidently many miners did, as Professor Stucki discovered during his study, but he wanted to keep his daughter in school in Ajo, so that she would have a better chance than he had and he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.678" offset="10535497">Thus he was penalized by the Bureau for having exercised the fundamental right by having gone to Ajo a few miles from his reservation to find work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.029" offset="10576875">Moreover, the regulation acts as an inducement for him to come back to the regulation and there evidently are a number of cases described not only in the various Committee hearings, but in the affidavits in this case, in which Indians have returned to the reservation.</text>
