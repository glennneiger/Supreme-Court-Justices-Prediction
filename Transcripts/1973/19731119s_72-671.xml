            <label>Justice John Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="12.289" offset="125910">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.614" offset="143256">This case involves the interpretation of the phrase “National Origin.”</text>
            <text syncTime="22.447" offset="166557">In Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Mrs. Espinoza, a citizen of Mexico who resides in San Antonio, was refused employment by Farah Manufacturing Company because she is not a United States citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.443" offset="234475">We hold today that an employer's refusal of the hirer person because he or she is not a United State citizen does not, standing by itself, constitute employment discrimination on the basis of the quoted words National Origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.126" offset="301244">We reach this holding in line for the most part on the clear indication that Congress did not intend to turn national origin to embrace citizenship requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.928" offset="348473">Two points deserve emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.538" offset="358922">First the question presented is not whether Congress has the power to prohibit private discrimination because of alienage nor whether Congress itself discriminate against non-citizens in federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.419" offset="410436">The question is not what Congress can do or should do, but what Congress did in the Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.696" offset="443559">Second, the record in this case, conclusively shows that Farah did not discriminate against persons of Mexican National Origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.787" offset="479922">In fact, 96% of Farah’s employees are of Mexican National Origin, as was the individual hired in Mrs. Espinoza’s place.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.235" offset="525688">The company’s policy and our holding is limited to a citizenship requirement which is applied in an ethically neutral manner barring employment of a blue eyed blond haired citizen of Sweden, a black skinned citizen of Nigeria or a Spanish speaking citizen of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.429" offset="606459">Discrimination against persons of Mexican national origin, like discrimination against women or Negroes is also forbidden under Title 7, but nothing in Title 7 was intended to prohibit an employer from applying a racially neutral and ethically neutral requirement of United States citizenship.</text>
