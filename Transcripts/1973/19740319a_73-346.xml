            <label>Mr. David Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="28.189" offset="189544">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.449" offset="202501">This case is here on certiorari to the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.985" offset="216712">It arises in Logan County, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.101" offset="233117">The charging statute is Section 241 of 18 U.S. Code, a conspiracy statute that has been before this Court many times before most recently in Guest, in Price and before that in Classic in Williams and Screws.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.676" offset="299468">The central issue as we understand this case is whether an alleged conspiracy to cast fraudulent votes in the State primary election, in this particular case for the office of a County Commissioner of Logan County, West Virginia states a Federal offense under Section 241.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.164" offset="389433">So far as we are aware, this question is not yet been ruled upon by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.163" offset="409391">Now the Government finds in the record a much simpler case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.786" offset="423915">It contends that the indictment alleged and the evidence showed two separate conspiracy violations for casting and counting fraudulent votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.480" offset="466651">One, for the election of State and County Officers and the other for the election of candidates for Federal Officers and the Government regards this case as ruled in effect by Saylor in Classic and Ingram and I suspect would have the writ dismissed as improvidently granted. The facts were not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.963" offset="556617">The petitioners were indited on January 12, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.619" offset="579187">The text of the indictment is in this white brief of our petition for certiorari to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.458" offset="606563">There were five defendants, all of them were State officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.989" offset="624744">William Anderson was Clerk of the County Court of Logan County.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.589" offset="639060">John Browning, Clerk of the Circuit Court of Logan County, its intermediate State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.184" offset="661525">Ernest Red Hager was a Deputy Sheriff of Logan County, Bernard Smith was the West Virginia State Senator and Earl Tomblin was the Sheriff of Local County.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.704" offset="711576">A paragraph six of the indictment in Appendix B states that the primary election that was held in West Virginia on May 12, 1970 for the purpose of nominating candidates for two federal officers, the United States Senate and the US Representative and I quote “various State and County offices”.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="219.289" offset="953887">A paragraph nine describes the conspiracy from May 1, 1970 to January 12, 1971 date of the filing of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.114" offset="997251">The five defendants are said to have conspired to dilute the vote of qualified voters secured to them by the Constitution of Laws of the United States to vote for the aforesaid officers that is for the two federal officers and the various State and county officers which are described in paragraph six.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.303" offset="1085962">Now, paragraph 10 of the indictment ties the alleged conspiracy to a single precinct in Logan County, Mount Gay precinct that we’ll hear a good deal about.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.797" offset="1131938">He asserts that conspiracy violated State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.664" offset="1147402">There’s no contest about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.625" offset="1159210">The evidence centers around what happen before and after May 12, 1970 in connection with the voting that took place at the Mount Gay precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.488" offset="1194736">There are no allegations in this case of racial bias, there’s no charge that voting rights were in anyway denied or abridged or diluted because of racial color.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.802" offset="1239980">According to the testimony, these five defendants with the help of three election officials who were stationed in that Mount Gay precinct, setup the house that merely means that the defendants these five men obtained the help and the cooperation of three people within the precinct office to attain their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.512" offset="1318766">Now, what was their purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="312.998" offset="1328692">Their purpose was to secure the Democratic Nomination for County Commissioner of a man named Okey Hager who headed a slate for various State and Local offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.192" offset="1377489">Okey Hager was already the incumbent County Commissioner and he is the father of Ernest that’s Red Hager who was one of the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.419" offset="1426390">There is a testimony that a man named Cecil Elswick who was one of those three people stationed at the Mount Gay precinct and he was a co-conspirator that granted immunity by the Government, cast false and fictitious ballots on the voting machines at Mount Gay for the entire Hager slate and he got rid of poll slips, destroyed them so that the number of voters could not be determined except from the machine tally.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.085" offset="1545091">The trial lasted twelve days, the transcript is nearly 2,000 pages long and the five defendants were all found guilty under 241 and given provisional maximum sentences of 10 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.698" offset="1607576">I spoke of the Hager’s slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.800" offset="1619905">What is the role of the federal officials in relation to the Hager slate?</text>
            <text syncTime="392.105" offset="1645192">Okey Hager’s major opponent for County Commissioner was a man named Neal Scaggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.735" offset="1675703">Hager and Scaggs each headed a Democratic Party slate or faction.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.606" offset="1703184">Now, repeatedly in its brief, the Government says that Senator Byrd and Congressman Hechler who were seeking renomination in 1970, were on the Hager slate and that the Mount Gay precinct was setup to ensure the nomination of all candidates, State and Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.764" offset="1791791">We find no support in the record for this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.672" offset="1807464">So far as we can tell, neither Byrd nor Hechler was on the Hager slate or part of the Hager faction and the alleged conspiracy of these five defendants was limited to certain State and county offices including the [Voice Overlap] committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.775" offset="1939853">Now, there’s some evidence that Cecil Elswick did cast unlawful votes for Byrd and Hechler in the Mount Gay precinct but we have found no evidence in the record, Your Honor, and we’ve examined all of the Government’s record references that Byrd and Hechler were the object of any conspiracy or that they were on the Hager slate at all.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="497.915" offset="2068376">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.139" offset="2069316">I’m about to go, Your Honor, into the statistics of what actually happened there.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.998" offset="2092722">Now, this was a Democratic Party primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.675" offset="2107455">Byrd and Hager were important, incumbent federal officials seeking renomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.509" offset="2130756">They were clearly supported, that is Byrd and Hechler, by both factions.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.260" offset="2153744">It happens that Neal Scaggs slate is in the record and there is no candidate for federal office on it. Yet in 31 precincts that Scaggs won, that is out of the 59 reporting precinct in Logan County, Byrd won by over 94% and Hechler by over 79%.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.252" offset="2245799">Now, when we examined the returns for Logan County as a whole, counting all of the 59 precincts including those won by Hager.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.022" offset="2280803">We find that Byrd won by 95% and Hechler by some 82%.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.121" offset="2305254">He went up by 3% in the County as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.913" offset="2320405">Now, Your Honors, it would have been an absolute absurdity to setup by single precinct out of 59 in Logan County for Byrd who was running Statewide, 55 Counties in West Virginia, 60 precincts in the State -- in the County of Logan, setup one precinct for Byrd.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.569" offset="2398981">Or for Hechler, Hechler had a large Congressional District including eight counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.904" offset="2420402">There was absolutely no political justification to setup Mount Gay for Byrd or Hechler.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.623" offset="2443285">Now, whatever conspiracy these defendants may have entered into had absolutely nothing to do with the candidates for federal office, for these defendants, the contest was between Scaggs and Hager.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.362" offset="2502217">Now, even the Government’s key witness, Cecil Elswick and it was he who testified that he had put the illegal votes on the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.134" offset="2537326">He was very careful to separate Byrd and Hechler from the Hager slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.041" offset="2560940">There are excerpts from Elswick testimony of the Government’s brief but each time that Elswick referred to Byrd and Hechler, and there are only two references, Your Honors, in the 2000-page transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.447" offset="2614544">He speaks of helping to win “for the Okey Hager slate” and for Byrd and Hechler.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.104" offset="2653205">Wholly natural because Hager, the Red Hager who was one of the defendants in this case also happen to be the County’s Democratic Executive, Head of the Counties, Chairman of the County Democratic Executive Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.710" offset="2719556">Now, we simply invite the Court to examine the Government’s transcript references.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.218" offset="2749649">None of them we believe, we’ve examined them, all supports the Governments conclusion that the Hager slate included Byrd and Hechler or that this conspiracy was in anyway directed toward Byrd and Hechler.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.846" offset="2812134">Now, let’s take at look what happened at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.442" offset="2822478">What was the Government’s theory at the trial below in the District Court before Judge Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.514" offset="2842854">Now, again, although the indictment included a reference to federal officials indicated in the text of the indictment, the case was tried in the District Court as a conspiracy to secure the Democratic Nomination for County Commissioner for Okey Hager.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.637" offset="2915265">The assistant US Attorney in his opening statement made this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.971" offset="2936581">He repeated this again in his closing statement and then when the case came up to the Fourth Circuit, the Fourth Circuit concluded “The true object and purpose of the alleged conspiracy was to secure the Democratic nomination of Okey Hager as County Judge.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.763" offset="4111778">Now, obviously the Congress didn’t intend the 1870 Act to apply to non-federal elections unless some form of racial discrimination was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.504" offset="4166740">Indeed it was convinced in 1870 and the history has shown in many decision of this Court at that time the Congress had felt that the Court -- the Congress felt that it had no Constitutional authority in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.554" offset="4218984">But today, we do not question the existence of Constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.867" offset="4244167">The question we’re submitting to this Court is whether without Congressional sanction Section 241 should now by interpretation of this Court, be extended to cover the Federal policing of State and local elections where racial discrimination is not shown and it’s not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.250" offset="4317727">That I believe is a central issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.480" offset="4330684">Now, so far in my view, Your Honor, the Courts could extend Guest and Price to cover Anderson although the indictment and the record in this particular case would I think present the Court with troublesome problems that I’ll come to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.344" offset="4406126">We urge however that the Court leave the decision on federal policing of State and local elections to the States and to the Congress where again racial bias is not shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.997" offset="4456699">There’s ample legal justification for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.688" offset="4467461">The Congress has considered this matter many times before, most recently I think in 1957 and 1964 and again in the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.598" offset="4511138">The legislative history is fully set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.876" offset="4524304">There’s no need for the Court to expand the jurisdiction of the Federal Court into this area which so far has been reserved to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.005" offset="4556800">The authority which the Government now seeks from this Court for its prosecuting attorneys has been deliberately and consistently withheld by the Congress and it’s peculiarly the kind of authority which lends itself to partisan and even geographically discriminatory political direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.389" offset="4646348">The States we submit must be given a full opportunity to come to grips with these issues of corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.644" offset="4679367">We’ve see it Maryland, we’ve seen that in New Jersey what’s been happening and even in West Virginia in this particular case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.567" offset="4702981">A State grand jury had been called and had come in to session and it was the US Attorney as we understand it who asked that the State grand jury not be convened and warned that if it were convened, the Government would seek an injunction to stop it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.827" offset="4772049">Now, let me turn for a moment to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.471" offset="4786678">Again, paragraph nine of the indictment charged to the defendants with the conspiracy to injure the qualified voters of Logan County by denying them the right to have their votes fully counted, by having their votes diluted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.763" offset="4843833">Defendants moved to dismiss the indictment and the motion was denied on the ground that the indictment adequately charged the defendants under Section 241.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.798" offset="4879987">At trial, the Government sought to prove a conspiracy that had at its object not the Office of Senator or Representative but County Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.189" offset="4921469">The indictment didn’t specify the State or County Office which was the object of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.351" offset="4946129">The indictment didn’t suggest that the five defendants or their three co-conspirators were acting under color of State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.606" offset="4979148">It did not identify the separate Constitutional Rights or rights which were allegedly denied, and as a practical matter, it failed clearly to inform the defendants of the charges against them and all of their subsequent motions for discovery and clarification were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.187" offset="5053544">It wasn’t until the trial began that the defendants and their counsels first learned that the alleged conspiracy involved the State Office and it wasn’t until the fourth day of trial that they know who the unnamed co-conspirators were and where the acts took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.370" offset="5126269">Now, the deficiencies -- well, if in the indictment and this goes to a point of the question Mr. Justice Brennan asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.535" offset="5158870">The Government had at least separated the two alleged offenses in separate counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.128" offset="5185306">The Court and the defendants would have been in a position to challenge the legal sufficiency of Section 241 and its application to State and County Offices and at the close of the Government case the sufficiency of the evidence in relation to the Federal charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.178" offset="5257509">This wasn’t done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.093" offset="5265136">Here the Government was in the enviable position of being able to defend a motion to dismiss by arguing that a conspiracy to cast fraudulent votes in a Federal election clearly stated an offense under Section 241 and then proceed to try the case on the basis of a conspiracy to cast votes in an election for a local office and on appeal the Government will then be free to urge affirmance on whatever basis that felt emerge in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.701" offset="5767523">The term willful, this Court said in that Section must be construed to mean a purpose to deprive a person of a specific Constitutional right and then it said that that issue must be submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.374" offset="5914227">We’re dealing here with an alleged voting frauds in Federal and State elections under separate Constitutional Provisions due to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.094" offset="5949127">Now, under Screws and Price combined, the Government was required to demonstrate specific intent to violate each of these provisions and the Court, the District Court, was required to submit these issues to the jury under its charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.037" offset="6028852">The District Court of course failed to do that, the indictment failed to separate the Constitutional provisions and no such charge was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.258" offset="6061767">Now, the essential problem was the defect in the indictment and that obscurity wasn’t cleared by the evidence that came in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.806" offset="6100010">If this was a multiple conspiracy, as the Government contends, then neither the prosecutors nor lawyers that tried the case, nor the District Court that heard it nor the Fourth Circuit that reviewed it, appreciated that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.718" offset="6155598">Now, I have one final point and that is on the matter of the relief we have requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.567" offset="6175033">Under a very broad Section 241 indictment, the Government security conviction on the assumption that this Court had already ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.157" offset="6213381">That 241 permits the Government, Federal Government, to police State, the voting frauds and asking this Court to reverse the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.329" offset="6254028">We’re simply asking the Court not to extend the jurisdiction of Section 241 to local elections where no racial fraud is shown but we do recognize in this in response to questions that Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.343" offset="6322155">We do recognize that the Government might have presented evidence, if they had any, under the same indictment showing a conspiracy by these five defendants to cast fraudulent votes in a Federal election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.970" offset="6388611">It didn’t do so but if the Court concludes that the Government should now be given a chance to produce such evidence, if it has it, then we urge that the decision below be reversed on the issue of statutory interpretation and remanded for trial under appropriate instructions on the Federal issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.671" offset="6899461">Let’s assume that this Court said, well if the indictment was wholly proper because of the Federal case, Federal election the evidence, then the conviction would have been proper on normal circumstances as to protect the Federal election but then could you avoid the State election question or is everything tainted by the fact that there was an evidentiary question here, admissibility of evidence question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2277.765" offset="9187788">Cecil Elswick who was the witness during this part of trial was testifying about his activities and he is the one who did the actual casting of the fraudulent votes in the Mount Gay precinct and his testimony recounted on page six.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.917" offset="9276395">When he was asked what the petitioner Hager asked him to do and bringing him under the conspiracy, he answered that, “He wanted me to go along with them and if I didn’t, he would cause me trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.595" offset="9343164">He was a Deputy Sheriff”, the petitioner Hager.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.594" offset="9355076">To detail you what he meant by going along with them and they answered go along and help win the Mount Gay precinct on election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.122" offset="9385273">They questioned “For whom?” and answered, “For the Okey Hager’s slate and Senator Byrd and Ken Hechler” that was when Mr. Elswick was brought in to the conspiracy and as the Chief Justice suggested, the record does show that petitioner Hager was the Chairman of the Democratic County Committee and he may well have had an interest in maximizing the votes for the Federal candidates as well as for his father who was running in the most hotly contested elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.243" offset="9541695">Then the testimony goes on, on page seven as that footnote continues, Cecil Elswick testified that he in fact put fraudulent votes on the ballots at Mount Gay for the Federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.478" offset="9606687">“Mr. Elswick, did you put any illegal votes on those machines that day?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.384" offset="9622256">“Yes sir, we did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.078" offset="9629048">“How many?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.748" offset="9631765">“I lost count at about 90 it was over a hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.365" offset="9646184">I lost count that evening, I only more on after I lost count, so it was over a hundred votes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.101" offset="9669172">“Who were you putting those votes on there for?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.121" offset="9681189">“I was putting them on there for Senator Byrd and Ken Hechler and Okey Hager slate before I count” etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.729" offset="9719641">And the evidence shows mathematically as its recounted on page eight of our brief that fraudulent, false, fictitious votes were in fact cast for the Federal candidates or votes were cast for each Senator Byrd and Congressman Hechler and there were voters who could have possibly voted in that precinct that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.513" offset="9830818">There is also on page seven in the footnote, references in the record to the Byrd’s slate which was apparently synonymous with the Hager slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.046" offset="9884944">The Federal candidates where opposed in that election as the figures that counsel for the petitioner gave the Court indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.928" offset="9928411">They received a high percentage but not 100% of the vote in that primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.472" offset="9962684">Then we have here a situation in which possibly the motivation, the motive of the conspiracy was solely to win the election for the County in a Court office that was at State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.594" offset="10027154">This was not the theory of the defense, there was nothing introduced in evidence at the trial to show that the conspiracy was anything other than a conspiracy to cast votes for the Federal and State offices and indeed it would be inherently incredible to think that they could conspire to stuff more than 100 ballots in a precinct of this size for the State offices alone because it would be so conspicuous and so likely to allows suspicion if the vote was that much less for the well-known Federal candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.822" offset="10216072">Again, for the State candidates it obviously, it would not be an effective way of proceeding and there is some indication in the record on page 44 of the appendix that are this indeed may have been one of the reasons why the conspiracy embraced the Federal officers as well as the State ones and Mr. Elswick testified about what petitioner Browning said to him in a meeting, concerning what was to be done at the Mount Gay precinct and the question there on page 44 about six or seven lines down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.797" offset="10387958">“You’ve seen Mr. Browning was at that meeting?” answer “Mr. Browning was at that meeting and when we walked outside to the door, there he said Cecil, put them on there but don’t put enough on there to get in any trouble” He meant don’t pull all the registration book or you would get in trouble and they could catch it easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.180" offset="10465489">Well, obviously that at least meant not to cast more votes than they were possible voters in the precinct but that --</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.209" offset="10597564">And so the entire theory of the case was that this was the single conspiracy which involved the casting of fraudulent votes for both the Federal and State offices and the evidence introduced while it showed that it also tended to focus a great deal on what was the principal contest and the contest, the outcome of which was affected by the votes cast at this precinct because countywide, the difference between the vote for Mr. Hager and the vote for Neal Scaggs, his opponent, was only about twenty-one votes and more than one hundred fraudulent votes were cast for Mr. Hager according to the allegations here in this one precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.506" offset="10834756">This was enough to change the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.479" offset="10842697">This was the dramatic aspect of the conspiracy and the aspect that had given rise to subsequent acts on the part of the conspirators to effectuate the counting of those ballots in the State contest proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.835" offset="11080098">And as we know, in political life, the magnitude of victory can be quite important in determining governmental policies where even if they don't change the outcome but who was elected to office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.577" offset="11155017">Now, the evidentiary question to which Mr. Justice White has alluded, arose because the defendants contended at the trial that in its instructions and this was the only objection made to the Trial Court’s instructions and preserved at the trial, that the jury should have been instructed to disregard all evidence of acts that occurred after the results of the election had been certified approximately a week after the election date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.764" offset="11315827">There had been much evidence introduced at the trial concerning the contest proceedings about the results in the County of Court raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.220" offset="11357623">All of which occurred after the certification in an effort to upset the certification for the State office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.460" offset="11390537">And in the course of passing on whether that evidence was properly admitted, and that is the controversy about whether evidence was improperly admitted, the Court of Appeals held that it was properly admitted with respect to the conspiracy charged and proved confining itself to the conspiracy for the State offices because it held and this is on page 18A of the appendix of the petition for certiorari because it held that the true object in purpose of the conspiracy charge, so far as this question is concerned, was to secure the Democratic nomination for Okey Hager as County Judge and that this conspiracy embraced the attempt to effectuate these returns throughout the contest proceedings and not end with the formal certification of the results that was subject to being undone in the contest proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.927" offset="11680496">So that the evidence that had been introduced concerning the continued efforts of the conspirators in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy after the formal certification was properly admissible the Court held.</text>

            <text syncTime="3905.414" offset="15698442">It seemed to them like something that had been decided in Guest and Price and we agree with them that the essential thrust Guest and Price is that 241 applies to these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.664" offset="15763435">This was thoroughly considered at the time, 241 had given the Court a great deal of trouble and in a unanimous opinion in Price, the Court concluded that 241 does apply all rights under the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments italicizing all in the Court’s opinion as well as to all other Constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="4018.859" offset="16152137">This is exactly the question that the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit had before it in a case called Devoe against the United States which is cited in the footnote at the very bottom of page 15 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4047.096" offset="16265091">I’m quoting from page 588 now at 103 F.2d, “The Government’s evidence was not at any time directed towards showing the existence of a number of separate and distinct conspiracies but was directed toward showing one general conspiracy which contemplated in part a false count and a false certification of the ballots cast for the Congressional candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.124" offset="16361221">So much of the conspiracy has constituted a violation of the federal law was a part of the general plan or scheme of those engaged in the conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4096.667" offset="16463412">And that is the Court of Appeals in the present case could have used the exact same language in disposing off the case without reaching the issue whether 241 applies to a conspiracy that do not involve the casting of fraudulent votes for the Federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.497" offset="16550766">So, we think the judgment should be affirmed on either of these grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.910" offset="16572395">We leave to our brief the discussion of the adequacy of the indictment to alleged action under color of law if the Court reaches that issue.</text>
