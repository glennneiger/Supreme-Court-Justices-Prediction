            <text syncTime="50.610" offset="279197">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I am William Lucas representing the petitioner in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.748" offset="307722">In North Dakota, we have a statute which provides that if a corporation applies for a pharmacy permit that a majority to stock in that corporation must be owned by a registered pharmacist in good standing, actively and regularly employed in and responsible for that actual management, operation and supervision of that pharmacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.879" offset="388284">Now, the respondent in this action applied for a pharmacy permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.068" offset="405002">And in their application, they disclosed that all of the stock in their corporation was owned by Red Owl Stores, which is a large supermarket chain in the Midwest and that it was not known if any of the shareholders of Red Owl were registered pharmacists.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.581" offset="463099">The State Board of Pharmacy in North Dakota then denied this application based upon the reason that they did not comply with the ownership law that I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.085" offset="509074">The respondent then appealed to the District Court to raise various constitutional questions mainly the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause and various constitutional issues on the North Dakota Constitution and then a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.566" offset="578978">The District Court relied on the Liggett versus Baldridge’s decision of this case and declared that this statute was a violation of the Due Process Clause and also a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.720" offset="639582">The petitioner then appealed to the North Dakota Supreme Court, and the North Dakota Supreme Court basically relied entirely on the Liggett versus Baldridge’s decision of this Court in 1928 and stated being bound by the decision in Liggett versus Baldridge and see an insufficient reason to distinguish that decision from this case, we sustain a trial court’s conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.923" offset="732473">The Liggett decision was based upon a Pennsylvania statute --</text>

            <text syncTime="167.054" offset="745012">Mr. Lucas, before you go any further, my understanding of the procedural history of the case may be a little bit different to yours.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.873" offset="776255">Let me check it with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.818" offset="783987">As I understand, the North Dakota District Court, your trial court, gave summary judgment for Snyder’s.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. William Lucas</label>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="187.678" offset="827455">And that was on the basis that the constitutional provision that the North Dakota Law violated the constitutional provision and that the Pharmacy Board’s conclusion that the drug store did not meet the space requirements was also invalid for the first summaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.759" offset="899762">And I take it the Pharmacy Board had two reasons for turning down Snyder.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="215.150" offset="937378">And then, when that was appealed by you to the Supreme Court of North Dakota, the Supreme Court of North Dakota affirmed on the constitutional issue but reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.087" offset="973113">Didn’t it on the space issue saying that the board should have further proceedings?</text>

            <text syncTime="229.586" offset="995056">They decided there was a fact question in regard to the physical safeguards.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.458" offset="1050540">It was remanded back down for an additional hearing in regard to the physical safeguard problem of the facility.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. William Lucas</label>
            <text syncTime="261.118" offset="1121176">Well, it would be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.260" offset="1125773">I imagined by the respondent again if it adverse on physical safeguard feature.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="267.269" offset="1145835">But, very likely not on a constitutional basis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_william_lucas" startTime="269.741" stopTime="593.364">
            <label>Mr. A. William Lucas</label>
            <text syncTime="269.741" offset="1155762">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.832" offset="1156075">I think that the decision was final in regard to the constitutional questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.465" offset="1182616">On the Liggett decision, that involved the Pennsylvania statute which required 100% ownership by a pharmacist and both, the North Dakota Supreme Court on the Liggett decision were based entirely on a Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.529" offset="1246877">We feel that the basic issue here is whether the Liggett versus Baldridge decision is proper authority for the North Dakota Supreme Court to rely on or if it has been reversed or if it should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.899" offset="1296300">Now, there has been a large change in the philosophy of the Supreme Court in regard to what legal writers have referred to as Economic Due Process since the Liggett versus Baldridge decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.435" offset="1342485">In our briefs, we traced this history citing the Lochner, Adkins and Coppage on the later cases which have rejected those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.306" offset="1378011">In examining the later cases such as Griswold versus Connecticut, Ferguson versus Skrupa, Williamson versus Lee Optical, Daniel versus Family Security, Savion versus Hostetler.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.381" offset="1422315">It’s very clear in my examination at least that the doctrine that prevailed in Coppage, Adkins and Lochner cases has been abandoned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.555" offset="1466932">This Court has stated we emphatically refused to go back to the time when we used the Due Process Clause to strike down state laws, regulatory or business in economic affairs because we feel they are unwise and prudent or out of harmony with some particular school of thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.933" offset="1528477">The Court has stated we do not set as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom need reasonable on us or merits of state laws that touch economic problems or business affairs or social conditions that under our system of government, these issues are properly left to the legislative branch of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.582" offset="1611128">Now, in the Daniel versus Family Security Life case, specific reference was made to the Liggett case and has said that the rational followed in that case did not find expression in the Liggett versus Baldridge decision and that there has been a pronounced shift of emphasis since the Liggett versus Baldridge decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.493" offset="1678733">Also, I have stated various State Court decisions that have said that Collins and Liggett have been seriously limited if not completely undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.481" offset="1718648">Now based on these decisions, we feel there is an extreme presumption of constitutionality and validity of state legislation in this particular area that if the North Dakota legislature determined that there was an evil present and this was a rational way to prevent this evil or to correct the exposure to this evil that this is efficient to sustain the constitutionality and validity of the statute that if any set of facts can reasonably justify the statute, we feel that is efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.239" offset="1853753">Now, the respondent, in their brief that raised also the Equal Protection Clause and amicus brief for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores devoted more time to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.925" offset="1904431">I think this basically is governed by the same standard of review as the Due Process Clause that only invidious discrimination is prohibited and the states have wide latitude in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.614" offset="1963154">I think it’s got the same standard as the Due Process Clause and in effect, it should be also left after the states in their own wisdom and judgment as far as the a passage of such legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.987" offset="2008712">Now, the amicus of National Association of Chain Drug Stores also raised the Commerce Clause issue and this was raised for the first time on appeal and I don’t think it’s properly raised or should be under consideration here when it is raised for the first time on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.599" offset="2075167">However, the case as I cite had to do mainly with the State’s attempt to protect local industry at the exclusion of national industry or some outside national commerce depot and that the case as they say such as Dean versus City of Madison where case is where the state attempted to protect the local industry such as requiring that milk process within five miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.801" offset="2176000">It had to be a process within five miles in the City of Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.991" offset="2188748">And this particular statute applies at what we have in this case equally to local corporations, local chain stores -- we have local chain stores or chain stores within the State of North Dakota and this law applies equally to those as well as any national chain stores that they might refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.758" offset="2259801">Also, we do not feel that this statute has anything to do with interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.218" offset="2281639">I think it’s safe to say that there are no prescription drugs manufactured in the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.033" offset="2304836">And I think, I can also say that all prescription drugs that are properly approved by the Federal Government are available in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.279" offset="2337855">And that the volume in sale of prescription drugs of course is governed by prescriptions from doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.246" offset="2357708">And if for example, we led a hundred more chain stores or a hundred more stores opened in the state, theoretically, there will be no greater sale of prescription drugs because they are limited to prescriptions and I think they would have to point out that there are -- it’s the demand for prescription drugs which are not being filled in the state and there is no evidence of course in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.905" offset="13252336">I can see a state to saying we are going to stop that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.252" offset="13617737">But with just several minutes left, I really want to say that we’re not contending that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to interfere with a reasonable exercise or the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.387" offset="13690253">We do contend that the act here is unreasonable and that the evidence produced by Snyder’s at the time of the hearing before the trial court to the effect that it’s conducted a drug business would be under North Dakota Pharmacist strictly for the people’s benefit and not because of the post regulation by federal state statutes and the regulation promulgated under those statutes that there just is no reason for this law because there isn’t any evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.171" offset="13853466">And we don’t think that you have abandoned entirely the -- and you haven’t abandoned this proposition of Liggett that the legislative means must substantially further legislative ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.539" offset="13918877">Or at the very least, we say that there must be a showing made by the state of a minimal rational means and relationship to that -- the object of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.459" offset="14006544">We just maintained that the statute makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.798" offset="14035905">In so far as the public health welfare does make sense, if the purpose was to keep the druggist in business, it could make some sense assuming proof again that the physician should not own a drugstore.</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.652" offset="14179370">I don’t have anything real urgent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.412" offset="14186371">I’d like to say that in my return to the motion, I admitted that there was no question or fact in regard to the basic ownership as to who on the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.710" offset="14219598">I think there’s an obvious question of fact whether the statute is related to the public health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.391" offset="14242273">And one point as far as relating it, I didn’t mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.824" offset="14256065">In North Dakota of course, we need small town pharmacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.408" offset="14266410">And when you get to interstate highways in ease of chance -- getting to the bigger cities, when these chain stores advertise by of course a motor oil for a dollar and they all run this mart to get their motor oil and pick up their prescriptions, this hurts the small town pharmacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.404" offset="14326387">And as a public health requirement and necessity, I think that the small towns have their pharmacies, and this is another basis that could be used to justify it.</text>
