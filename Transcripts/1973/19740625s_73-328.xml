            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="9.628" offset="115252">This case comes to us by certiorari from the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.624" offset="139285">It involves basically the right of a candidate for political office to command advertising space in car cards on vehicles of public transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.285" offset="185887">The petitioner, who was a candidate for the Ohio House of Representatives, was refused available advertising space on the transit system of the City of Shaker Heights, a Cleveland suburb.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.815" offset="240013">He brought this suit, challenging the constitutionality of the municipal policy which refuse political advertising but did allow other types of public transit advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.545" offset="290900">The state courts declined to give the petitioner relief and the Ohio Supreme Court, by a four-to-three vote, held specifically that the cityâ€™s refusal did not violate a candidate's free speech or equal protection rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.358" offset="354220">We affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.557" offset="362998">I have filed a plurality opinion, joined by the Chief justice, Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.497" offset="394762">We conclude that car card space is a not a First Amendment forum and that a city may exercise some discretion with respect to the type of advertising that may be displayed in its vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.040" offset="448888">We also conclude that here the decision to limit these transit advertisements to innocuous and less controversial commercial and service-oriented advertising serves to minimize chances of abuse or the appearance of political favoritism and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience, and that this involve no First or Fourteenth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.451" offset="554527">The opinion as I have noted is a plurality one only but not a majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.273" offset="577829">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a separate opinion concluding that the petitioner, although free to express his views to a willing audience, has no constitutional right to force his message upon a captive audience which uses public transit vehicles as a means of transport, not as a place for discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.601" offset="663197">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
