            <label>Mr. Steven A. Sindell</label>
            <text syncTime="61.231" offset="321724">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.729" offset="335621">I don’t believe that this case can be decided with respect to the questions of law that are presented without a reference, at least some reference point to what the record contains with regard to the facts and I think something has to be said in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.253" offset="417750">The complaint filed in this action clearly state what would otherwise be a cause of action as at least, I can best understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.208" offset="469577">We have alleged that four innocent students were shot on a college campus without any justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.812" offset="499984">We have alleged, members of this Supreme Court, we have alleged that the Governor and the Generals conspired intentionally to deprive these people with the specific intent and bad faith in effect of their rights under the Federal Constitution and under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.436" offset="582531">We have alleged that these facts are true and that they can be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.030" offset="604891">We were confronted with a motion to dismiss on which as I understand it and notwithstanding any affidavit that was ever filed, and this record contains, if anything, the liberal invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination by some of these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.774" offset="671869">We have alleged, in these cases, that there was no justification for it and nevertheless, and not withstanding that and based upon what we felt in effect were news media accounts of this incident that the passions of the headlines were substituted for the rules of evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.245" offset="749714">And I quote specifically, where the concurring opinion in the lower court said that “the pleadings clearly contrive to hide rather than disclose the true background of the events” and the predicated causes of action without disclosing their true subject matter, without any evidence before that Court to so find, that is exactly what was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.566" offset="859011">The majority opinion in the lower court is infected with statement after statement that there was a riot, that there was an insurrection, that there was a rebellion and members of this Court, even the Governor of the State of Ohio the after it occurred never used a word like that, in his proclamations to justify it, not one word to that effect, nevertheless, the Court has so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.792" offset="955873">Now, I’m not suggesting anything except that there is a colorable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.964" offset="976562">What as juxtaposed to these allegations have the defendants set?</text>
            <text syncTime="229.869" offset="996206">They have invoked the privilege against self-incrimination at least nine times in response to material interrogatories and more importantly, if we are going to take judicial notice, let us then take judicial notice of one responsible investigative organ of this nation and that is the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where it was specifically stated and I’m quoting at pages 24 and 25 of our brief things like these.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.968" offset="1104666">“We have some reason to believe that the claim by the National Guard that their lives were endangered by the students was fabricated subsequent to the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.960" offset="1144581">One guardsman admitted that his life was not endangered and that he fired indiscriminately into the crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.178" offset="1169450">He further stated that the guardsman had gotten together after the shooting and decided to fabricate the story that they were in danger of seriously bodily harm or death from the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.425" offset="1214485">No, the guardsmen were not surrounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.231" offset="1225665">No guardsman claims he was hit with rocks immediately prior to the firing.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.698" offset="1239562">There was no sniper.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.613" offset="1247190">Some guardsman are known is yet had to be physically restrained from continuing to fire their weapons,” directly quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.646" offset="1279373">The people shot in this case were over a football field away.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.458" offset="1298599">One man sits here today in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.750" offset="1315736">And I say that if we are going to substitute in the Court of Law, in the Court of Appeals, news media headlines or whatever predilections of the facts the Court may have for the presentation of evidence in its orderly course then I say that we have really reached the stage where the rudimentary concepts of due process of law have been violated and I think that would be a shocking departure from procedure at least as I’ve always understood it in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.802" offset="1436003">We have here a situation where there was no claim of insurrection.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.634" offset="1459304">There is no evidence in this case, not only the day after the shooting and having this proclamation did he use insurrection, rebellion, invasion, riot, tumult or any such words, but Your Honors, in addition to that, months later with the advice presumably of competent counsel, my brother here, then he indeed not say anything more than if there were threatened disorders and breaches of the peace in the answers to interrogatories that are part of the record of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.279" offset="1589812">The President’s Commission on Campus Unrest said that this shooting was unwarranted, inexcusable and unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.256" offset="1617816">It is our view that the rules of evidence cannot be supplemented by the factual predilections of a judge reviewing a complaint not a summary judgment motion, but a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.900" offset="1680300">Now, specifically dealing with the question of immunity and I think it’s important that we do that here, in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.709" offset="1715618">In Sterling against Constantin, that Supreme Court was confronted with a situation where a Governor, Governor Constantin had issued a proclamation which was stronger than the one issued by Governor Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.850" offset="1776118">It said that there was an insurrection.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.349" offset="1786149">It said that there was a rebellion.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.228" offset="1793672">It said that there was a state of affairs which justified the calling of martial law.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.722" offset="1823660">And nevertheless, the District Court went on to find behind those allegations of the Governor in his proclamation that that wasn’t true.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.990" offset="1864725">And in fact, no such thing existed except what they characterized as breaches of the peace and when the Governor and the Generals came to this Court and said, “We are immune under the Eleventh Amendment,” this Court specifically held that a Federal Court has ample jurisdiction to determine the veracity of those allegations with evidence properly presented before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.714" offset="1955631">And I think the case of Moyer against Peabody is clearly distinguishable from this one And I want to address myself to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.575" offset="1983007">Indeed, Moyer was a 1983 action and there’s no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.192" offset="2005473">But what is important to recognize about Moyer and again I must return to the facts because I think they’re critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.711" offset="2031595">In that case, the Governor and the complainant both agreed on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.286" offset="2065868">They agreed, number one, without dispute that an insurrection existed and they agreed that the Governor acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.766" offset="2107768">Those were stipulated facts before that Court and I quote the language when I say that the Court, the Supreme Court, in its opinion said, “we are here assuming that there was no insurrection, excuse me, that there was an insurrection and that he exercised good faith and the only claim is that he was unreasonable in arresting Moyer under those circumstances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="531.155" offset="2201391">Now, this is not such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.267" offset="2213825">There is no agreement amongst counsel in this case that a state of insurrection existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.467" offset="2238589">Instead, we have alleged there was a peaceful gathering on a college campus with bullets intervening, the break up what otherwise was a peaceful gathering on a college campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.418" offset="2282371">Now, if we can't prove that, then we should lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.436" offset="2294491">But if we can prove it, it’s not a Moyer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.428" offset="2306508">We do not agree, as counsel did in Moyer that there was good faith on the part of the Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.528" offset="2330854">To the contrary, it is our allegation in this case, and it is our intention to prove that the Governor was personally involved in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.399" offset="2370351">That as Commander-in-Chief, remember this was a trial several days before the Republic Senator, senatorial primary and without editorializing on the validity of the law and order position that he was taking the fact is that that was his position that he advanced in that particular situation and here was threatened disorder and he just wasn’t sitting behind his desk, receiving information of an alarming situation and sending troops out, he went down there to that campus, the day before this incident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.555" offset="2506919">He made a speech in the presence of the Commanding General --</text>

            <text syncTime="624.443" offset="2574524">Your Honor, I want to go to Court and I want to prove these things and the reason that I bring these things into the case is to, is simply because three of the reviewing judges in this case, three of them, have gone outside the record and refused to believe that the allegations were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.701" offset="2639517">That’s why I go outside the record not to convince you that what I say is proof as a matter of law, but to convince you that there are allegations which weren’t the right to present evidence in a Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven A. Sindell</label>
            <text syncTime="658.900" offset="2712346">All you have to do is agree with me that the complaint’s allegation should be taken as true and it seems to me that we’re entitled to prove them.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.355" offset="2742126">I would like specifically, in regard to the Eleventh Amendment intention and I’d like to address myself to that for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.167" offset="2773368">It seems to me that the distinction that has been made here between a statute that an unconstitutional action under a statute that is allegedly unconstitutional is different than an action which is just plain unconstitutional because of the nature of the action, really was never intended as a distinction to be engrafted upon the Civil Rights Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.766" offset="2879843">Congress intended to reach the unconstitutional effect if I understand the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.862" offset="2904189">It says, “Every person who acts not under a statute, not under without a statute, within the statute, every person who acts under color of law to violate the constitutional rights of another is libel for that action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="721.999" offset="2964793">Every person and it doesn’t engraft any distinction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.738" offset="2979736">The only reason we’re not seeking an injunction in this case and it says in that statute, an action at law equity or other proper redress the breadth is broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.804" offset="3019964">We can't seek an injunction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.544" offset="3030936">All we have is the available remedy of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.613" offset="3043161">That’s obvious from the circumstances and therefore we are well within the terms of the Civil Rights Act and to say that only where a statute exists that’s unconstitutional, can the Civil Rights Act apply as to I think emasculate the very purpose that Congress had in mind which was to reach the State official himself for the affect of what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.781" offset="3127902">And this Court has never held for example in dealing with police officers in Monroe against Pape or Egan against the City of Aurora, in any of those cases that because they were acting under color of a valid statute, that therefore for some reason, they were immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.951" offset="3192581">That would be inconsistent, I think with the entire purpose of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.713" offset="3211598">They were conducting actions not under a statute, but on their own which were unconstitutional, which violated the rights of those individuals, and therefore, they were held inappropriately so by this Court to be within the purpose and intent of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.267" offset="3277845">It seems to me that cases like Ex parte Young, Sterling against Constantin, Griffin against the Board of Prince Edward County, all the way ranging from the passage of the Civil Rights Act right up until the present time have all held that where an injunction is the appropriate form of redress, the Civil Rights Act makes no distinction between damages and injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.167" offset="3365407">That issue has been raised here and I don’t think there is any difference because the Sterling specifically holds that an injunction is a more extraordinary remedy and damages is a less extraordinary remedy and other cases if so held as well of this Court and I don’t see the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.653" offset="3435311">It depends on the remedy that’s needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.918" offset="3444402">It would seem on the damage that has been done and not upon the nature of the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.567" offset="3466971">Congress never intended, as I read the legislative history, as interpreted by this Court, to make a distinction between damages and injunctive relief as to whether or not there’s immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.717" offset="3519634">I never read that in any of the decisions and I don’t think it’s supportable by any of the rules of law that have been promulgated by this Court and I’m thinking of cases like Mitchum against Foster, Monroe against Pape, Zwickler against Koota and particularly those various circuits like McLaughlin against Tilendis, Jenkins against Averett was a damage action, many cases under the Civil Rights Act about damages where damage is the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.803" offset="3631961">And what I think is critical here is that we did bring a case against the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.778" offset="3659860">We sued the State in its own Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.416" offset="3670413">We brought that case and we contended that the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity was unconstitutional in violation not only of the Ohio Constitution, but the Federal Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.914" offset="3980434">I think it’s critical to an interpretation of the Civil Rights Act to ask what the state of mind of the person you’re suing is, in addition to what the result was.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.630" offset="4019304">A mere accident can cause a terrible tragedy and yet not create liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.092" offset="4141140">At least a high degree of recklessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.736" offset="4147722">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.570" offset="4151066">I would say that would be the appropriate standard but I would not suggest to you that a lower standard is not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.853" offset="4176144">I’m simply saying that as the state of this case is now, I don’t see how we could have alleged anything stronger and that’s really what I’m suggesting in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.973" offset="4224627">I would emphasize that with respect to the Eleventh Amendment claim, Your Honors, that this case is not a case against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.512" offset="4270811">The State is not a party to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.391" offset="4282305">No money is being sought from the State Treasury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.266" offset="4301845">No judgment rendered in this case will require a state official to take any action or prohibit a state official from taking any action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.364" offset="4338207">This is not an action even against State officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.901" offset="4348343">The present defendants in this case aren’t even officials from the State of Ohio at all and I would suggest that the entire body of Eleventh Amendment law as I read it suggests that in such a case where the individual act is allegedly unconstitutional that that is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment and I think Sterling specifically so holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.060" offset="4441025">What is being attempted and I think this is the critical distinction here and if I understand the defendant’s argument is that we shouldn’t just consider these things, but we should ask ourselves what will be the effect on the Governor in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.987" offset="4512705">How fearful will the Governor be, the Chief Executive be or other executives below him and I might add it goes all the way down to the trigger man in this particular case and the Court held that everyone to be immune not just the Governor, but let’s ask that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.386" offset="4578325">What will be the effect that the State Government will not be able to operate that people will be fearful that they will have come in and defend lawsuits and so on and so forth, if I understand that argument correctly?</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.727" offset="4623673">And I would have this to answer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.884" offset="4636317">I would say that that argument can be made in every single case under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.483" offset="4670694">There is no case where it cannot be argued that the effect of suing an individual for damages for violating constitutional rights be the Governor or anyone else would not have some effect on their future conduct, would not give them some “pause for concern,” would not inconvenience them in some way, but it is my suggestion that the Act was exactly what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.899" offset="4772362">That was the very effect that was intended. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in part to deter this very kind of thing and if we are to give meaning to that enactment, I think we to recognize that the purpose and intent of that particular enactment was to effectuate the deterrence that any tort remedy has and this a congressionally sanctioned tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.444" offset="4874553">As I understand Section 1983, it is both a compensatory tort action as well as having a deterrent effect and the deterred effect that is complained of here is the very purpose of enactment in the first place and so to say, that because it has an effect, that should be the reason to bar suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.297" offset="4965982">For that reason alone, it seems to me that that run completely contrary to the whole intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.333" offset="4986044">It seems to me that if this Court should hold and we’ve sued the State of Ohio which has immunized itself in the state courts, If this Court holds that this too is an action against the State, then we are really left without a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.120" offset="5057202">We have no place to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.675" offset="5063471">Then this Court has permanently and forever foreclosed any right to appear in a Court of Law anywhere against anyone to test the allegations in these complaints and to establish any form of redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.059" offset="5120940">This Court will -- “This is it!</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.151" offset="5129404">This is our last opportunity to have redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.677" offset="5143406">There will be none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.764" offset="5147794">We can't sue the State in its own Courts and we can't if this Court should hold we can't sue here and we’re without redress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.771" offset="5175798">And finally, I would like to conclude with the question of immunity as it applies to legislators and judges and that has been raised and I am cognizant of Pierson against Ray and Tenney against Brandhove, and I think this is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.415" offset="5246433">First of all, let me say that I have some empathy with the dissenting opinions of Mr. Justice Douglas in those cases that a dishonest legislature if it so alleged and a dishonest judge should be subject to suit, but we have those decisions and they stand as they do now and I suggest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.537" offset="5334936">That after all a legislative process and a legislator is involved in a deliberative thing, the result of what he does is open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.121" offset="5381224">He has the opportunity, first he must concur with other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.588" offset="5399092">If his enactment is going to be harmful, a Court can review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.649" offset="5415393">All of this process can take place and there is full opportunity for the public in the democratic process to participate and so perhaps we can say as does our Constitution that a legislature shall not be examined in any other place and with the judge, the same is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.718" offset="5487595">It is an open process, presumably, a deliberative one.Before any finality takes place, a Court can review that action, but such is not the case with an executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.680" offset="5535451">In the case of an executive, you have a situation where the actions maybe or may not be taken with deliberation, but not necessarily with public participation at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.659" offset="5579337">The Governor, in theory, in his own chambers and secretly without making it public, open up and decide to wheel the weapons of death without any such legislative or judicial process as a result which the instant action of a bullet terminates a youngster or man or anyone’s life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.436" offset="5658540">Now, it seems to me that the executive immunity is applied in that situation is clearly distinguishable from what occurs with the legislator and with the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.953" offset="5700545">And under those circumstances, I suggest to you that to say that they are all in the same kind is contrary to the purpose of the Civil Rights Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.299" offset="5745894">To say that a Governor cannot even be or a General or a guardsman cannot be even subject to inquiry and we -- only has that he acts honestly in this case, we say he can make a mistake, that’s okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.109" offset="5809215">Is that he act honestly, that is the only claim we make and I suggest to you to say that we can't even inquire into his honesty which has never been subject to any open democratic process is in effect to seriously endanger the citizenry and to give a Governor or Generals an absolute unbridled license without any review or inquiry at all except who knows how long after in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.181" offset="5925512">I don’t think that’s the intent of the Civil Rights Act at all and I would like to reserve whatever remaining time I have, unless there are questions, for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.984" offset="5988728">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.682" offset="6007432">I’d like to address a preliminary remark as to my posture in this case while I am of counsel in both the Scheuer case which has just been heard and the Krause and Miller cases which are being heard together at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.461" offset="6078589">I represent Governor Rhodes in his individual capacity and I am fully cooperative with all defense counsel in this case and I endorse my brother, Charles Brown’s argument in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.561" offset="6158942">There are some things that I believe are applicable peculiarly to Governor Rhodes which ought to be brought to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.681" offset="6199484">I’m prepared to answer questions on any aspect of the case, but my argument in chief will be addressed to the Governor Rhodes’ position primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.899" offset="6244310">There has been a great deal of talk about the case of Sterling versus Constantin as it may have limited or may not have limited ex parte Moyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.922" offset="6288405">I believe it did not limit it in any material respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.842" offset="6308153">The requirement of Sterling versus Constantin is expressed at 287 United States 399 by virtue of his duty to cause the loss to be faithful executive, faithfully executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.160" offset="6397388">The executive has appropriately vested with the discretion to determine whether an exigency requiring military aid for that purpose has a arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.860" offset="6436153">His decision to that effect is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.380" offset="6450260">Now, the way Sterling versus Constantin arose there were stipulations and there was evidence taken which made it appear to the Court, to the District Court which had also had some prior jurisdiction on some of the same controversy that this exercise of discretion on the part of the Governor of Texas was not in entire good faith, that is, it was not within the limits of his discretionary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.139" offset="6589336">Since he was using it for the purpose of controlling the production of oil, even though the expression was made that there were tumultuous conditions, the proclamation, I might say, in the Sterling case is very similar to the proclamation in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.342" offset="6670106">That is, I am speaking of the proclamation of April 29th, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.896" offset="6696333">But in this case, the Governor was exercising as executive discretion with respect to calling out the guard and had proclaimed that there were riotous conditions, that there was tumult, that there was danger to persons and property and this, the Court of Appeals and the District Court felt was a matter of judicial notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.882" offset="6820258">That there was sufficient notoriety in the situation of the campuses in Ohio and indeed throughout the nation in May of 1970 that the Court could not effect to be ignorant of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.529" offset="6902909">My brother, Mr. Sindell, has made a very emotional argument with respect and running along pretty much along the lines of his brief, but he does not get into the actual allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.655" offset="6967380">If one goes to the actual allegations of the complaint, one must find that there are only mere conclusions as to the part which Governor Rhodes took in the matter other than the fact that he did issue a proclamation and that he did call out the guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.567" offset="7043030">In order to state a cause of action, here, I can understand that the question might be anticipated just what can a plaintiff do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.663" offset="7083363">Suppose a governor maliciously and corruptly and wantonly and evilly, let us say, decides to call out the National Guard for the specific purpose of extinguishing a life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.874" offset="7152222">If he does that, surely there are facts which could be stated in a complaint other than the bare conclusion that the defendants conspired to deprive the plaintiff or the decedents of their Civil Rights in each of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.314" offset="7250024">There are -- there must be other facts available which could be pleaded which would support that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.953" offset="7276565">Obviously, there are not and obviously, there was a situation in which it could not be reasonable to conclude from the allegations of the complaint itself in either of these cases or in any of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.654" offset="7343334">That the Governor conspired and -- evilly, corruptly and we can use other adverbs, to deprive these decedents of their civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.265" offset="7413760">These conclusions are not reasonable under the facts well-pleaded in the complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.026" offset="7440823">Therefore, we submit that the judgment of the District Court below and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the majority of the two was correct that the 12 (b) (1) motion to dismiss was properly sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.928" offset="7520444">We submit further that there are other reasons on which looking only at Governor Rhodes’ particular situation one must conclude reasonably from the allegations of the complaints that there were substantial intervening causes, if anything, in connection with Governor Rhodes’ proclamation cause the death of these unfortunate people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.048" offset="7640921">There were intelligent intervening substantial forces which intervened between the proclamation which is all that is actually shown to have been promulgated by Governor Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.300" offset="7709989">Therefore, on other grounds, the motion to dismiss would properly have been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.153" offset="7753352">I submit also that the question of whether a state employee, if a National Guard can be an employee or a state officer, whether the Doctrine of respondeat superior applies and in this instance, we submit that there is no authority for applying the Doctrine of respondeat superior so as to bring Governor Rhodes within the ambit of a proper action against him in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.417" offset="7898384">And for all of those reasons and for the reasons, my brother, Mr. Brown has set forth, I would say that Governor Rhodes is in a fortiori situation with respect to all of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.771" offset="7971840">We must bear in mind that there are only seven defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.367" offset="7986260">There are, as Mr. Sindell refers to them, the trigger man, there are no persons alleged to have been trigger man in these instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.997" offset="8036728">And those must be taken as admissions in the briefs and as judicial admissions that there are no persons who are so charged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.404" offset="8086361">So, with respect to Governor Rhodes, any liability which applies to him must be on the Doctrine of respondeat superior which we suggest is clearly not applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.469" offset="8146651">As I understood the complaint, the allegation was that he ordered out the National Guard onto that campus at a time when he knew -- when he himself knew or should have known that arming them with live ammunition and sending them there in their state of training was an imminent danger to the lives of the students on that campus and that’s alleging personal culpability on his part not on any Doctrine of Respondeat Superior.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.070" offset="8272980">I would say if the arming of the National Guard is in and of itself an act on his or is a culpable act, yes just as he is personally charged with having issued the proclamation which called out the guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.060" offset="8348944">Yes, he is, if that is a culpable act, he is culpable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.813" offset="8363990">I submit that neither of those acts is one on which culpability can arise because the training of the guard is and this is a matter of judicial notice and is in the record, that the training of the guard is under the supervision of the United States Government and was at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.351" offset="8446119">The training of the guard was a responsibility of the United States Military Officers and the duty, the constitutional and statutory duty of Governor Rhodes was to call out the guard and the arming of the guard and the actions of the guard were the responsibility of the individuals and of any commanding officers who issued commands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.171" offset="8593450">I would submit that the act of calling out an armed guard is the risk that one takes anytime a National Guard unit is called out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.194" offset="8645486">It is within the realm of possibility that in the discretion of officers having discretion, there may be live ammunition used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.512" offset="11518746">What hasn’t been read is this, while the calling out of troops is unreviewable according to that case, it goes further and it says, it does not follow from the fact that the executive has this range of discretion deemed to be a necessary incident of this power to suppress disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.772" offset="11587814">That every sort of action the Governor may take, no matter how unjustified by the exigency or subversive of private right and the jurisdiction of the Courts otherwise available is conclusively supported by mere executive fiat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.566" offset="11642984">The contrary is well-established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.001" offset="11652702">What are the allowable limits of military discretion and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case are judicial questions and that is what we are contending in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.130" offset="11705260">And I would like to address myself to this matter of pleadings and what is well-pleaded and what isn’t pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.056" offset="11732950">I understand, at least, as a trial practitioner who engages in some amount of litigation, I have always understood that the basic concept is notice to pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.577" offset="11783105">That we are not required to plead volumes of evidence or any evidence really that I feel it was improper to plead evidence as such and that largely, the federal rules are designed to confine the pleadings to the general allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.654" offset="11843396">Now, we have alleged a conspiracy to engage in a direct act which involved deaths of people and that’s included in that concept those orders and judgments and statements in their backs that we believe exists in good faith to back it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.887" offset="11908284">Now, what I’m simply suggesting is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.515" offset="11918838">If it wasn’t well-pleaded and not for my brother, Mr. Alloway, then he had the prerogative under the Rule 12 (e) to tell me that and to make a motion to make definite and certain and to ask me to be more specific if I didn’t plead it well enough and he didn’t do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.770" offset="11991876">He didn’t ask me for more facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.977" offset="12000653">He didn’t say, “It’s so vague that it’s not well-pleaded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.514" offset="12014759">He didn’t say, “We don’t have notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.581" offset="12023118">We don’t know what you’re talking about.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.486" offset="12030642">Instead, he filed a motion to dismiss and thereafter, invited the Court to conclude.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.364" offset="12106188">He has every right to suggest that it’s infirm and I claim that where we had specifically alleged and I quote from the complaint, “All acts herein mentioned including everyone of them, the shooting and everything else were done individually and in conspiracy by these defendants with the specific intent of depriving plaintiff and plaintiff dissidents of their rights to due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.237" offset="12213708">I contend that if that doesn’t state a violation of constitutional right, then nothing does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.160" offset="12241398">Now, if he wants it more specific than that, then I suggest that he ask what he wants, that he tell me that it’s to vague and that’s the question of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.058" offset="12277029">But what I have said here in its allegation form and in its notice form is well-pleaded in the concept of the federal rules of civil procedure to give notice And let’s be practical about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.144" offset="12329273">I sit in an office that has four walls and I look at what facts I have at the time I plead and I know that the Governor was down there, that he was involved in this event, that he was personally present, that he was giving orders, that he was doing a lot of things.</text>
