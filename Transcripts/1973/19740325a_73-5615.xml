            <text syncTime="24.980" offset="176692">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.279" offset="189858">Once again there is before this Court the relatively troublesome problem of the right of a defendant charged with direct criminal contempt to the Court to have a jury of his peers decide the issue of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.644" offset="251298">Procedurally, this is case is relatively confused, however the issues are easily framed and quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.085" offset="289123">Dominick Codispoti together with Herbert Langnes and Richard OJ Mayberry came on for trial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania back in November of 1966 on charges of prison breach and holding a hostage in a penal institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.995" offset="352758">The trial lasted approximately six weeks and was marked by repeated altercations between the trial judge and between the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.103" offset="401136">The defendants were found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.965" offset="408660">They were given a 15 to 30 year sentence on one charge, a consecutive five to 10 sentence on other charge, and immediately at the end of the trial, the trial judge summoned them up some -- sentenced them anywhere from 11 to 22 years for the contempt of Court for the various statements that had been made in the presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.771" offset="499879">They then appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed their conviction with several justices dissenting upon with theory of cruel and unusual punishment and since this case had antedated the Baldwin decision perhaps on a right to a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.633" offset="575321">Do you think that the Courts under Illinois against Allen could have bound and gag these defendants as we said they could in Illinois against Allen, and then appoint counsel for them without regard to what they felt about counsel or appointing alternatively counsel as friends of the Court to act for them?</text>

            <text syncTime="158.764" offset="711784">Whether or not factually their disturbances were so tumultuous that would require an Allen type of gagging, I am not really prepared to say because I wasn’t there, I have the record there.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.619" offset="763193">The record is in somewhat of a contention as to exactly what was the genesis of this confrontation between the defendants and the justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.645" offset="959321">What then happened was that they appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.983" offset="988682">They petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari which was granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.503" offset="1970782">Mr. Codispoti then requested a jury trial and in exactly similar language that the Court had used for Langnes and Mayberry said, the Court; I regard this issue Mr. Codispoti as an issue between the Court, not any particular judge but between the Court and you and I think the record should speak for the Court and you can speak for yourself and I am going to refuse your motion for jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.464" offset="2090632">Mr. Codispoti then said, “Well, I would like some defense witnesses who were present during the original arbitration between Judge Fiok and myself, present to testify in my behalf.”</text>
            <text syncTime="516.330" offset="2142041">At the second hearing he was denied under these words the Court; I am going to refuse your motion to subpoena witnesses for the reasons that I told you.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.928" offset="2172447">I think that this is an issue between the Court and you and the record will speak for the Court and you and your counsel can speak for yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.900" offset="2200346">And this is what happened in every single trial that came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.216" offset="2213616">So with those words, they were denied the right to a jury trial, they were denied the right to present defense witnesses, and they were entitled to speak for themselves, the record will speak for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.200" offset="2253531">They weren’t even permitted to call the trial judge who simply resided maybe 50 or 65 feet in a courtroom immediately adjacent to the courtroom where the trial was being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.227" offset="2297626">That brings us to the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.126" offset="2309224">They were found and adjudicated guilty on all of these contempts of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.158" offset="2329391">On one of them, they received two months and on one of the contempts charges, they had received a sentence of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.536" offset="2362932">Mr. Codispoti, for some reason that’s not quite apparent to me was sentenced to a year for one contempt and the Court has set out in the appendix had simply said we sentence to a year for Citation Number 5 or whatever it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.431" offset="2426462">Approximately, a month later the Court revised this “rough draft sentencing” to make it down into six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.548" offset="2462929">All of the sentences ran consecutively and therefore they were imprisoned approximately from three to -- two to three years, give or take a few months one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.541" offset="2510890">And that brings us somewhat so through this route in order to a appreciate the issues here, the question of when there are -- when there is a single trial for a multiple contempts that have occurred during a particular trial, does the person’s right to a jury trial depend upon the aggregate sentence received, in this case several years, or does it depend upon the individual sentences received namely a six-month sentence which is aggregated into a three-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.392" offset="2638367">We would suggest to this Court that when there is one single trial that the appropriate remedy is to look at the penalty imposed in the total because it makes little difference to the man who is sitting in jail to say, “Oh, you’re only in jail for six months but you’re in jail six months 10 times, than to say that you’re in jail for five years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="661.808" offset="2723944">It makes absolutely no difference to him in regards to the length of his incarceration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.741" offset="4867762">Generally, the reasons for petty cases not being required to have a jury trial is maybe that they’re too small to really worry about that a couple of days, we can’t worry about judicial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.286" offset="4921887">We have to make sure the Court schedule flows well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.332" offset="4934113">But as I suggested to the Court earlier that has a relatively hollow ring to man incarcerated for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.118" offset="4961176">There was also the problem that generally the power of the court to punish direct criminal contempts that occurred incur in front of it can be grounded in a prophylactic rule that at least it will begin to restore order to the courtroom in an abstractor situation because of the immediacy of punishment it’s the act that is deterrent to future conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.757" offset="5039752">But in this particular case or in any case where the individual contempt problems are accumulated and then tried subsequent or termination of the main judicial proceeding, that prophylactic rational has no longer any viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.146" offset="5105371">Finally, the real problem in this is the problem of judicial abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.663" offset="5131389">I was sitting down talking with some lawyers and they said it to me that ours is probably the only profession in the world where a trial lawyer can be put in jail for being late for work because if you come late in front of the Court, its well within the competency of the judge to put you in jail and there’s probably no other single profession where that penalty is imposed for being late.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.252" offset="5525734">It’s not a question legitimately before this Court, but what the problem is that at least if there was a jury interposed between the judiciary who happens to be not only the prosecutor, not only the person who presented the charges, not only the trier of fact but also the imposer of sentence, to at least get a third party in there in the fact-finding position has a lot to recommend it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.643" offset="7215334">The Court through Mr. Justice Douglas states, “Our conclusion is that by reason of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a defendant in a criminal contempt proceeding must be given a public trial before a judge other than the one involved by the contempt nor citing in Re Oliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.696" offset="7295582">In the present case, that requirement can be satisfied only if the judgment of contempt is vacated so that on remand another judge not bearing the sting of at least slanderous remarks and having the impersonal authority of the law sits in judgment on the conduct of petitioner as shown by the record.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.771" offset="7467781">Right and I would indicate to the Court that the reason I bring this out also is the fact that this case arose prior to many of decisions that are argued in our briefs and those decisions being the Baldwin decision and the Seale decision and other decisions that have come up regarding contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.187" offset="7565479">The trial judge at the trial for the prison breach charges was acting only on -- the only decision that has come down from this Court to have been the Chef decision and the trial judge felt that he was acting fully within his powers in sentencing them on one to two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.682" offset="7647504">Now, that sentence was reversed by this Court, was vacated and the used sentence was imposed by another judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.373" offset="7686269">Now, the Judge Vandervort who imposed the six months sentences that no sentence ultimately was longer than six months against either of these two petitioners relied upon the prior decisions of this Court and I might add the Seale decision had not been decided at the time of the sentencing of these six-month sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.317" offset="7806015">Now, on remand these sentences were imposed and as the Court has observed, the petitioners again engaged in the conduct which I would personally categorize as contemptuous and in the record on page 76 probably the most violent act was recorded when petitioner Langnes after being told by the trial judge that he was holding in contempt of Court for his language directed at the Court, threw a microphone at the Court, fortunately it did not hit the trial judge, but that indicates somewhat I think the type of defendant that is involved in this case, but that is not relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.894" offset="8136307">Continuing with the history of case, the case then went up for an appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and finally to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.855" offset="8168176">Several reasons were alleged in the petition for cert, but this Court limited its grant of -- to the petition to two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.866" offset="8208196">The first being whether or not these sentences that were given to these petitioners should be aggregated in order to determine the right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.475" offset="8262635">The basis for this is that all of these offenses are somewhat linked as single offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.684" offset="8299520">The commonwealth would point out some of the factual things in this record to show that there were several offenses involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.561" offset="8339017">The trial as I indicated did occur over period of five to six weeks, the contempts occurred on various times during that six-week period and were not continuous, but they were occasional throughout this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.599" offset="8423131">Co-defendant Mayberry of course committed the 11 acts, but the petitioners here one committed six acts, the other committed seven acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.716" offset="8467644">They occurred over a period of six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.956" offset="8480601">It's the commonwealth’s position in this matter that they are identifiable as separate offenses and are not part of one continuous act and we have indicated in our briefs that we do not look upon the acts of these petitioners as Judge Cummings did in the Seale case where the defendant in that case based most of his contemptuous conduct on the fact that he was deprived of his right to counsel during the trial, the particular counsel that he wanted and that all of the actions of the defendant in the Seale case were premised upon that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.730" offset="8647680">Here, the petitioners engaged in several different acts of contempt directed toward the Court and based on various things that they found to be objectionable during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.587" offset="8703060">I would point also to this Court’s prior opinion in the Mayberry case for a solution to the question of impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.100" offset="8741198">The trial judge in the original prison breach trial against whom the contempts were directed was found by this Court to be not capable of being impartial because of the acts of the defendant committed and aimed at the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.165" offset="8817371">We have a proceeding on remand before another trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.110" offset="8841195">That trial judge cannot be said to have been affected by the decision, by the acts of the petitioners and although the transcript of the Mayberry proceedings are not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.867" offset="8912248">In the hearing on the Mayberry contempts, Mr. Mayberry being very knowledgeable of the opinion written by this Court in his case informed the Court after he had committed another contemptuous act before Judge Vandervort that he motioned the judge, Judge Vandervort to now disqualify himself from sitting in judgment of Mr. Mayberry because he was now been the object of the scorn of Mr. Mayberry and therefore must now disqualify himself from hearing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2350.072" offset="9477016">I would like to point out several basic fallacies with that rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.062" offset="9505019">First, being that the Court in Seale seems to assume that the trial judge is going to abuse the contempt power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.001" offset="9536784">It seems to me that that opinion is based upon the fact that the trial judge has given the power to summarily sentence a defendant for a contemptuous acts, direct criminal contemptuous acts that that trial judge will abuse that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.632" offset="9615256">I take exception with that and would argue that the traditional appellate review of abusive discretion is available to a defendant and that the Courts can find those abuses and correct them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.666" offset="9683383">I think it is very bad basis for the decision in Seale that the trial judge is assumed to be subject to abusing his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.283" offset="9749838">As far as the second issue is concerned the commonwealth, first of all would take some exception to the phrasing of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.993" offset="9784738">The issue was phrased in terms of a substantial term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.593" offset="9807099">The Pennsylvania contempt statues do not provide for a maximum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.136" offset="9829251">Theoretically, I suppose that it could be argued that the defendant could subject himself by contempt, direct criminal contemptuous act to and unknown sentence, the maximum for which is not provided by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3556.550" offset="14302981">I think that what this shows is that somewhat high miracle characterization they can attend our contempt analysis here because one thing that -- I think has emerged in regards both of the presentations here today is that when this case originally came up to the Court, the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had termed his conduct outrageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.489" offset="14402664">Mr. Justice Douglas of this Court termed the conduct of the defendant a shock to those raised in the western tradition of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.302" offset="14441953">He had received 11 to 22 years sentence and all of a sudden when he comes back for a trial what has become at least according to the characterizations of the our new original trial judge the Justice of the or the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the Justice of this Court as outrageous has been transformed into a petty contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.625" offset="14523246">And I feel that that type of labeling putting on these are crime is what brings to fore the problem of looking solely to the actual sentence received on each crime rather than the aggregate sentence because by looking at the aggregate sentence, the effectiveness, the total problem that gets up here is well before the Court.</text>
