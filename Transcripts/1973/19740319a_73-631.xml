            <label>Mr. James D. Tracy</label>
            <text syncTime="32.147" offset="205322">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.700" offset="219533">This case is here as you know on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals from the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.118" offset="245238">That Court affirmed a decision of the United States District Court which had held the petitioner, together with another employer, was required to arbitrate under the collective bargaining contract of the other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.652" offset="323396">Actually, there were two other employers they are referred to in the brief as Grissoms and because there were several names, I will use that name for convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.323" offset="378044">The issues presented are of whether petitioner is a successor employer as that term is used as a term of art in Labor Law, and whether petitioner is required to arbitrate grievances presented by Respondent Union under the contract between Respondent Union and the other employer, the Grissoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.294" offset="509910">The case arose with the beginning of June 1972 when petitioner, Howard Johnson Company entered into an agreement with his other employer as referred to as Grissoms, under which it was to buy a motel and a restaurant then being operated by the Grissoms who were franchisees of the Howard Johnson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.757" offset="647732">That agreement provided for sale of certain assets in the motel and restaurant and for leasing of property on which they stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.044" offset="700918">It did not provide for assumption of contracts other than a contract with respect to advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.769" offset="739788">On July 9, the -- excuse me -- on June 28, the Howard Johnson Company petitioner notified the seller that it would not assume the labor contract which the seller had with Respondent Union, two contracts existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.468" offset="826619">On July 9, the other employer notified its employees that they would be terminated at July 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.015" offset="880849">On July 13, the petitioner notified Respondent Union who had inquired at that time as to petitioner’s intent that it would not recognize the Union contract, which respondent had with the other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.613" offset="959216">A few days later, the petitioner commenced interviewing prospective employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.731" offset="987638">It put advertisements in the local newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.353" offset="1002162">Indeed, it put a sign in the very motel and restaurant where its business is being conducted, saying that it would be hiring employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.654" offset="1091396">A contract ultimately called for closing at 12:01 am and the testimony is -- and this was put in on stipulated facts but the record is clear that at 12 o’clock, the franchisee discontinued its operations.]</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="269.623" offset="1155239">I take it you have conceived that that is a factor of some importance in the case.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_d_tracy" startTime="275.213" stopTime="552.179">
            <label>Mr. James D. Tracy</label>
            <text syncTime="275.213" offset="1177600">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.354" offset="1190139">That certainly goes to the question of the meaning of a successor employer and I will certainly discuss that issue with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.532" offset="1230890">The petitioner did hire employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.957" offset="1248549">It hired some who had worked for this predecessor employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.530" offset="1266834">Actually, it was 9 of the 33 I think in the restaurant and none of approximately 12 in the motel.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.368" offset="1298181">It had a complete change of supervisory employees; none of the supervisory employees of the predecessor were retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.042" offset="1332872">An entire new supervisory staff was brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.576" offset="1351053">The employees who were hired prior to July 24, the date on which the transaction was closed, were trained at another Howard Johnson facility which was nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.991" offset="1396715">And thereafter, on July 24, the transaction was ready for closing and that was a Sunday night or a Monday morning, but on the Friday preceding that, Respondent Union brought suit in state court seeking an injunction against what it termed “locking out” of employees and also seeking an order that both the predecessor employer and the petitioner should be required to submit to arbitration issues, which the Union desired to raise as to the rights of the employees to continue at their jobs as to the right of the Union to insist the collective bargaining continuing effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.287" offset="1593887">And at a subsequent date, that case was removed to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.104" offset="1625130">It was quickly submitted to the Court under Rule 65 or the Rules for Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.239" offset="1645714">There was an immediate final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.971" offset="1656581">The case was submitted on stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.546" offset="1670896">The Court was puzzled frankly as to appropriate application of this Court’s decision in National Labor Relations Board versus Burns and this Court’s decision in John Wiley and Sons versus Livingston, and the Court attempted to accommodate those two decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.393" offset="1766296">And we submit that the Court committed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.998" offset="1784790">The Court of Appeals also faced the problem of the accommodation of Wiley and Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.921" offset="1836408">The District Court said that it was holding only that the Union’s request that the merit go to arbitration should be sustained, and that that did not necessarily mean that the contract in total should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.335" offset="1934106">That was in recognition of the decision of this Court that a contract does not survive the transfer of a business, as stated in Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.535" offset="1986873">When that question got to the Court of Appeals, the same problem existed in the mind of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.041" offset="2016862">This Court having said that the contract does not survive but nevertheless, this Court not having overruled Wiley what should be the application of this contract to this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.739" offset="2091677">I might point out unlike Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.012" offset="2104842">In this case, there is still a predecessor employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.968" offset="2124591">The entities, which I have referred to as Grissoms, appeared in the original proceeding, first in the State Court and in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.015" offset="2172761">They did not contest the Union’s request for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.226" offset="2193659">They stipulated that they will arbitrate the issues which the Union has sought to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.275" offset="2217900">So there will be an arbitration proceeding if the respondent desires to press that, and that as I say is a very large difference from the Wiley situation in which the predecessor employer had disappeared by merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.966" offset="2360633">The issue as to whether Grissoms have breached the contract they made with the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.616" offset="2383203">Did they, when they agreed that that contract would be binding on themselves and successors, commit? That if they sold their business, they would require the successor to assume the contract.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="588.192" offset="2429492">Suppose the arbitrator concludes, yes, they did breach it. What’s the award?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_d_tracy" startTime="593.595" stopTime="647.737">
            <label>Mr. James D. Tracy</label>
            <text syncTime="593.595" offset="2451122">An arbitrator has wide authority to make an appropriate award and in that case, I submit he could award money damages without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.673" offset="2491455">I think that is his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.315" offset="2510054">So in this case, we come to the issue should this employer, the bound arbitrate, under that contract of the Grissoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.213" offset="2557597">Now, the starting point of that is, is the employer a successor?</text>
            <text syncTime="625.103" offset="2577136">And the difference between those case and in almost every case involving the definition of successor which has ever come up is that this employer did not employ more than a few of the employees of the predecessor, and the question becomes is the employment of at least a sufficient number of employees to constitute a majority --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="647.737" offset="2667729">I suppose the issue would have been here then even if Howard Johnson had employed none instead of nine?</text>

            <label>Mr. James D. Tracy</label>
            <text syncTime="661.055" offset="2721019">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.088" offset="2729064">There is a footnote in the Union brief which I think it’s page 22, which seems to indicate that maybe the petitioner has stated the Court Order in this case too broadly and that maybe all the District Court ordered was that there would be arbitration as to the effect on the employees the Union represents -- that’s what it says -- of the action that took place here.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.956" offset="2852571">We think it is clear that the Union has sought broad arbitration and that indeed, it seeks to apply the entire contract although both the District Court and Court of Appeals have said, “The difference between those case in Burns is that unlike the Labor Board --.”</text>
            <text syncTime="711.922" offset="2924460">And this is the Court of Appeals’ language, “the arbitrator could be selective in his application of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.411" offset="2958420">He need not adopt an all or nothing approach.”</text>
            <text syncTime="725.465" offset="2978586">Now we submit that that is not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.865" offset="2996245">The arbitrator as this Court has frequently recognized is a product of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.143" offset="3029368">Arbitration is a voluntary contractual thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.736" offset="3051729">Mr. Justice Powell in the recent case of Alexander versus Gardner-Denver noted limitation on the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.889" offset="3088300">And in Gateway Coal, he noted that arbitration exists only when there is a contract to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.607" offset="3123200">Now, the contract which is applicable in this case has a clause in it that says, “The arbitrator cannot add to, nor subtract from, nor modify the contract and no issue as to renewal or extension of the contract is subject to arbitration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="782.828" offset="3208046">We submit that the Courts below have ignored that contract provision in suggesting that an arbitrator could somehow not take an all or nothing approach to the contract, that he could some way or another decide that some provisions of the contract should apply but not others.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.263" offset="3289757">And we submit also that such an approach would leave an arbitrator completely contrary to the Burns’ decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.051" offset="3328940">Now again, the arbitrator doesn’t have authority to make a new contract for the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.182" offset="3361437">His authority is to interpret a contract which the parties have made, but he cannot pick and choose among the provisions of the contract and say this will apply to this new employer, but this will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.189" offset="3425489">And again, Mr. Justice Powell noted in the Gardner-Denver case that the arbitrator cannot go outside the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.070" offset="3469061">He went on in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.222" offset="3485675">The arbitrator really cannot even go to application of the Civil Rights Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.157" offset="3509394">He is limited to the application of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.912" offset="3528411">Actually, what occurred here of course is the arbitrator is bound to accept the entire contract and clearly, he accepts the seniority provisions in the contract and his first ruling is that the petitioner should have taken all of these employees of the predecessor as its employees because they had seniority rights with the predecessor under this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.896" offset="3632379">Now if that is so of course, there is also a Union Recognition clause and a Union Bargaining Status Clause in the contract and presumably, the Union has now become the sole bargaining representative of the employees of petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.144" offset="3869362">So the things that we decided in Burns just would not occur in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.035" offset="3896842">Now, should that be because this case came up in the context of a suit by the Union under Section 301 whereas Burns came up as an appeal from a National Labor Relations Board decision, and the Court of Appeals faced that squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.023" offset="3968836">They said there can be a dichotomy or can be two different rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.575" offset="3987017">It is a contract in 301 but it’s not a contract in the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.405" offset="4102374">We have here many of the criteria of successorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.836" offset="4132049">The question is however, do we have the freedom to select our own labor force?</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.247" offset="4169770">If we do and if that is a crucial factor in determining whether an employer is a successor and we have not become a successor, and most of the statements of the criteria of successorship include the composition of the work force and the composition of the supervisory force.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.912" offset="4280424">I would like to conclude this portion of my argument and reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, but I submit that this Court should go back to the decision in Lincoln Mills as a starting point in the approach to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.634" offset="4347298">Lincoln Mills said that under Section 301, the Federal Courts are to apply a body of Federal Law developed from the intent of the Federal Labor Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.019" offset="4400797">The intent of the Federal Labor Law is clear; there must be majority status in order for the Union to gain recognition.</text>
