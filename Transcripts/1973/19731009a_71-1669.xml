            <text syncTime="1409.672" offset="5715487">I’d like to add a couple of facts to the facts as presented by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.626" offset="5747252">At the outset, let me point out that the car was driving back and forth between the driving lane and the passing lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.496" offset="5778704">The defendants, the record reflects, looked through the rearview mirror and upon seeing the police officer, took evasive driving tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.570" offset="5815066">They drove behind a grocery store and on to another street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.445" offset="5830531">In the opinion of the officer in an effort and in the un-contradicted testimony of the officer, in an effort to evade him, one of the points that this Court was careful to point out in Sibron and Peters is an important factor in determining whether or not there is a mens rea.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.630" offset="6159256">Let me just rapidly point out several more facts that I have not yet been brought out, which I think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.538" offset="6186945">After attempting to evade the police officer, he was stopped and the police officer testified that he stopped him in order to determine if he was intoxicated because the car had been weaving in a suspicious fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.389" offset="6242325">He said that after the respondent left the car, it was his impression that he was intoxicated because of his actions and because of his blurry eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.605" offset="6279210">The officer said that it was his impression from observing him that he was intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.213" offset="6301571">Another point that I think it’s important to note -- or let me answer some questions that were raised by the Court regarding the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.452" offset="6338560">Justice Marshall mentioned and asked the question, “How can you arrest the man for a crime that you cannot convict him of?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.776" offset="6359876">I think it is important to note that he can be convicted of not having a driver’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.398" offset="6378371">The police officer had no way of knowing at the time of the rest whether or not the man had a driver’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.733" offset="6399687">It is true that if the man had it and simply did not have in his possession that Florida does not convict, but the officer doesn’t know that until the man arrives in Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.384" offset="6982322">It was a search without an arrest, something this Court has never before permitted and the Court felt compelled to create some serious restrictions upon this delicate new area and we concede that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.514" offset="7030805">But here we’re dealing with something that the Court has traditionally permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.498" offset="7046792">Search incident to a concededly, lawful arrest and that’s an important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.826" offset="7072078">I would also point out, Your Honors that there is a distinction here between the facts, not only dealing with the question of whether or not there was a lawful arrest, but what the officer was doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2157.885" offset="8708284">Your Honors, if I might then move on to the second point in our argument and again, I think it's not necessary since I think that first point sufficiently justifies the search in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.260" offset="8749767">But if I might move on to the second one, we think in addition that the officer here was entitled to search for intoxicants, and I would remind the Court again, respectfully that the record clearly reflects by un-contradicted testimony that the officer saw the defendants, saw the respondents, weaving back and forth on the highway at 2 a.m. in the morning, that upon his approach behind them, they attempted to evade him by leaving the highway, driving behind an alley in the back of a grocery store to another street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.076" offset="8881006">And then when the respondent left his car, he was in the impression of the officer intoxicated, blurry eyed and by other actions, intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.724" offset="8919667">These factors have been traditionally upheld as sufficient probable cause to arrest for intoxication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.545" offset="8950909">I think that it is important here to note something that the Florida Supreme Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.974" offset="8968673">They said that, “In today’s proliferation of illegal drug use which affects the faculties, checking only for liquors is no longer adequate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.191" offset="9013499">I would suggest, Your Honors that that point is well taken, particularly where the officer smelled no alcohol, he had the right to attempt to find other intoxicants, including marijuana and there’s no place more reasonable to search for marijuana cigarettes than in a cigarette box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.175" offset="9085492">We’re dealing here with a serious hazard on the streets of a city and I know of no way, Your Honors in which a police officer and I would point out that in all of the recent cases, Adams and Terry and Sibron and Peters, this Court has reflected its concern --</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.446" offset="9438563">Justice Harlan’s point was that the man can’t be heard to come before this Court and say, my conviction should be reversed because he didn’t arrest me before he searched me even though he arrested me afterwards, even though he had probable cause to arrest me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.224" offset="10909675">To just settle on this intoxication argument, I would reiterate by saying that throughout the testimony of the police officer, it shows both by his testimony and by his actions the fact that he didn’t arrest him for driving while intoxicated, the fact that he never searched the automobile for any evidence of intoxicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.641" offset="10999327">The fact that he testified under oath that he didn’t have enough evidence to charge him with the most minor of all offenses which was careless driving by weaving.</text>
