            <label>Ms. Joanne Condas</label>
            <text syncTime="66.605" offset="343144">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.900" offset="356310">This case is here brought by California on appeal from the decision of the three-judge Court, holding unconstitutional the exclusion of Section 2626 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code which excludes pregnancy from coverage under the Disability Insurance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.601" offset="443141">The cost impact of this decision is estimated to be a minimum of a $120 million annually, based on the current level of operations of the disability funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.562" offset="490998">And the question we present to this Court is whether a state can establish a Disability Insurance Program which compensates wage loss from illness and injury but not for normal pregnancy without violating the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses of the Constitution, when there is neither discriminatory intent in the creation of the fund nor discriminatory impact in its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.061" offset="601025">In order for the Court to understand how this case arises, I would like just very briefly to describe how the fund was originated and developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.140" offset="641358">In 1946, California became the second state to adopt a Disability Insurance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.193" offset="669571">This arose primarily because during the Second World War, enormous surpluses had build up in the unemployment insurance fund in California because there is virtually no unemployment during the war years and the governor proposed that the 1% which employees had to contribute to that fund should be shifted to provide disability insurance instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.708" offset="759536">And the governor in his message explained why he thought that 1% should be the figure and why, since it was coming from employees, it should be kept low, and that is that an employer can always pass along whatever is charged to him in terms of the cost of doing of his business in terms of providing a service or cost of goods but to an employee, there is no one else to pass the charge and as to him it amounts to a gross income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.452" offset="878550">It should be borne in mind of course that there is no employer contribution to this particular fund, that was an illustrative example only.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.274" offset="913868">Well, the Disability Insurance Program has been financed within the limits of that 1% and this was accomplished primarily as a result of incorporating certain features in the California plan that were different from the Rhode Island plan which was the only model that California had to go by at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.114" offset="989205">Rhode Island had begun paying benefits in 1943 and by 1946, in the middle of the year, they had gone from a $2.7 billion surplus to a $1.5 million deficit and there were primarily two factors, omissions really from the Rhode Island plan that accounted for this financial problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.531" offset="1090873">The first was that they had not provided for the prevention of double recovery, it was possible under the Rhode Island plan to recover both workman’s compensation disability and unemployment disability for the same illness, and secondly, they had included pregnancy coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.688" offset="1167464">Pregnancy benefits posed a larger problem for Rhode Island and really amounted to more than twice what was paid for the workman’s compensation duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.921" offset="1208424">The California plan made changes in both of those features.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.323" offset="1226083">Section 2629 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code prevents the double recovery and Section 2626 excluded pregnancy until 28 days after determination of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.892" offset="1304346">Now the reason I used that in the past tense is that last year, that section was amended and it now provides for coverage for complications for pregnancy instead of the exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.220" offset="1353665">Mrs. Condas, you told us about the Rhode island experience and the fact that Rhode Island was the first state to have any such plan as this and California the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.839" offset="1392118">There are now, about a total of five states or six?</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="337.340" offset="1426077">Well I just wondered if any of the states now have the plan to provide maternity benefits, currently.</text>

          <turn speaker="joanne_condas" startTime="345.885" stopTime="377.837">
            <label>Ms. Joanne Condas</label>
            <text syncTime="345.885" offset="1460245">Yes currently, perhaps the best example of the potential problems that we are discussing is the State of Hawaii and Hawaii, in May amended its law to provide coverage for pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.798" offset="1515938">The situation there is that premiums for men employees have remained $3.25 per employee per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.630" offset="1551256">The rate for women was always a little higher and this simply is standard in the disability insurance field.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.878" offset="1572258">The rate for women was $4.00 per female per month.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="377.837" offset="1588140">It doesn’t go on a percentage out there, it is fixed sum in dollars?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joanne_condas" startTime="381.603" stopTime="445.874">
            <label>Ms. Joanne Condas</label>
            <text syncTime="381.603" offset="1603187">It’s a disability insurance premium charge and as a matter of fact, all but a certain base period as California has a limitation on what the employee can be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.023" offset="1652820">Hawaii has a limitation on what the employee can be charged and so the increase in cost in Hawaii will be picked up by a charge to employers but that charge is enormous, as I say in the case of men the rate has not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.628" offset="1711229">It is $3.25 per man per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.929" offset="1724500">For a woman, it has gone from $4.00 per woman per month to $8.76 per woman per month and the only thing that has changed is the inclusion of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.718" offset="1775595">I might also mention that New Jersey provides a maximum of eight weeks of benefits, four weeks before birth and four weeks after birth, that’s the maximum and the New Jersey experience is that between 49 and 57% of its fund go to pay for pregnancy benefits.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="445.874" offset="1860232">And those two states do pay for pregnancy to any of the other three or -- what are they, total of five?</text>

            <text syncTime="456.933" offset="1904431">Rhode Island of course was the first state, now they have had several changes in their law.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.131" offset="1925224">At the present time, they provide for a maximum lump sum for a normal pregnancy of $250.00 in benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.584" offset="1955109">California now covers abnormalities and complications of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.574" offset="1979037">I am somewhat uncertain as to the present state of New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.323" offset="1998054">Their law excludes pregnancy but their human rights commission has required employers to treat pregnancy for all disability purposes like --</text>

            <text syncTime="492.000" offset="2044761">Yes and I don’t know enough about the details of the plan, to know just what financial impact that has ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.427" offset="2078407">Well, California incorporated the features that it could from Rhode Island in order to enable it to carry out an essential purpose to the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.572" offset="2123024">The essential purpose to the California disability plan is to provide at low cost a fund which provides benefits having significant levels of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.681" offset="2167432">They’ve always been a fairly healthy wage continuation and to provide broad coverage, to help as many employees as could be helped.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.493" offset="2206720">The plan pays out virtually all of its income in benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.264" offset="2225842">In the past five years for example, the ratio of payout to benefits has been 90% in the range of 90% of income to 103% of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.016" offset="2276833">The plan provides for comprehensive benefits, as I have indicated but it does contain actually three exclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.059" offset="2304940">One is, and they are all based on the inordinately high cost of providing them, based on actuarial standards common in the insurance industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.320" offset="2342034">The first is the short-term disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.012" offset="2352797">Unless you have a waiting period of some duration, you are just swamped with small claims so there is an exclusion of any disability which are less than eight days.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="578.869" offset="2392189">Unless the person is in the hospital, isn’t that correct?</text>

          <turn speaker="joanne_condas" startTime="581.369" stopTime="635.973">
            <label>Ms. Joanne Condas</label>
            <text syncTime="581.369" offset="2402220">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.610" offset="2411207">The second exclusion is the disability that endures more than 26 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.645" offset="2431373">That does not matter whether he is in the hospital or not, that’s simply the maximum benefits allowable and the third one is the pregnancy exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.774" offset="2467840">As I have indicated, the experience of the California fund is much like that of the disability insurance industry generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.311" offset="2505979">It soon became apparent that it did result in women deriving substantially more benefits than men.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.363" offset="2538162">This results primarily because we do have the flat rate and so when you have a situation in which you charge people a flat rate and you have the standard in the insurance industry that women file more disability claims, the impact of that is that women derive substantially more benefits than they make contributions.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.768" offset="2643801">I was wondering if what you just described might be a functional, the lower wage levels for women.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.800" offset="2671909">They pay in less therefore and even then assuming they got the same benefits as men did, they would get greater proportionate benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.562" offset="2826971">Indeed, we discovered recently that perhaps the highest claim filing rate of all is women who make in excess of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.658" offset="2867409">Well, that’s the background of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.796" offset="2875977">Background of this litigation is that there were two suits, one brought in the Federal District Court, the other brought in the California Supreme Court by petition for writ of mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.066" offset="2924983">Both alleged that the exclusion of pregnancy amounted to a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.563" offset="2947030">Since the California Court had already ruled on the constitutionality of its statute, in a case called Clark versus California Employment Stabilization Commission, the cases were transferred and consolidated in Federal Court, a three-judge Court was convened and the matter was heard on cross-motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.409" offset="3038354">Now, I want to make one point from the California case because I think it's key in terms of what we see as the rationale for exclusion of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.217" offset="3081613">In the Clark case, the state court said that the legislature was entitled to consider “Whether the objects of the statute would be best served by including a disability benefit which reasonably might impose upon a majority of employees, a burden disproportionate to contemplated benefits in order to favor the minority who are included within the classified group.”</text>
            <text syncTime="775.045" offset="3176908">In other words, the Court was concerned that the pregnancy benefits would result in a disproportionate amount of benefits going to a subgroup and that is exactly what has happened in other states and it’s exactly what we predict will happen in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.533" offset="3242841">The Federal Court, the Federal three-judge Court equated the classification of pregnancy as one based on sex and held that it denied equal protection to pregnant women and also held that pregnancy benefits could not be excluded simply on the basis of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.689" offset="3315461">As we have indicated, it is not simply cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.413" offset="3326433">It’s the combination of factors that make up the California plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.651" offset="3343360">Cost, the broad coverage and the significant level of benefits that it is desired to maintain.</text>

            <label>Ms. Joanne Condas</label>
            <text syncTime="917.434" offset="3746482">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.075" offset="3769051">Although the issue in all of the briefs has been discussed in terms of the sex limited characteristic, the California plan covers any kind of sex limited disability of either sex, with the exception of pregnancy, so that what this case boils down to is the question of what provision of the United States constitution compels us to include pregnancy in our disability insurance plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.610" offset="3887229">We say, California says that the equal protection doesn’t compel it because the Equal Protection Clause requires another class similarly situated and the majority below acknowledged that pregnancy is unique and that no one is situated similarly to a pregnant woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.411" offset="3958387">Judge Williams in dissent below had difficulty finding any equal protection factors involved here on the basis that women derive significantly more benefit from the operation of the program than men do.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.524" offset="4010841">They contribute only 28% of the withholdings and they draw 38% of the benefit payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.230" offset="4033620">Now whether you wish to attribute that to lower pay for women or not, it is apparent that there is no desperate impact in the operation of this fund upon women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.192" offset="4077505">This Court did not treat the pregnancy question before it recently, in Chesterfield Board of Education versus LaFleur, in the equal protection context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.418" offset="4118465">It rather based its decision on due process considerations and that’s a test that we urge the Court to adopt here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.332" offset="4154096">It’s California’s contention that we have a valid state interest in maintaining the solvency of this insurance program and also in providing comprehensive benefits to the maximum number of workers who can be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.588" offset="4219089">This Court has said that in the area of economics and social welfare legislation that the Court will judge the relationship of the means and ends on the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.790" offset="4259944">Now, if the Court is willing to do that, I would like to discuss the five factors which in combination, we believe amply justify the exclusion of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.115" offset="4305189">Certainly, questions could be raised and qualifications made on anyone of these factors individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.631" offset="4335282">It’s a combination of factors which California urges, requires the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.146" offset="4365375">The first is the relative cost factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.460" offset="4378540">The second is that the condition of pregnancy is generally voluntary and subject to planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.105" offset="4405185">The third is that pregnancy disabilities have a significantly longer duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.318" offset="4430054">The fourth is that treating physicians apply a different medical standard and finally the fifth, that there is a major difference in the return to work rate following disability from pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.467" offset="4486583">First, in terms of the relative cost, the majority of the three-judge Court accepted the appellant's estimate that pregnancy benefits would add 40% to the operation of this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.373" offset="4534230">It simply regarded that increase as irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.483" offset="4546664">As I have indicated, the experience of New Jersey is that it costs even more than that in terms of half of their benefits, approximately going to pay complications and benefits of one category of disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.839" offset="4604134">This cost estimate is also consistent with a joint statement filed with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance on February 11, 1974 by the Health Insurance Association of America and the American Life Assurance Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.675" offset="4675500">This group represents 500 insurance companies who together ride 90% of the Health Insurance in the United States and in that joint statement, they indicate that for an employer providing a typical disability income plan, this is not just medical benefits while you are in the hospital, this is the income protection kind of plan that covering pregnancy would add between 40% and 50% to the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.794" offset="4779886">I have already given you the impact in terms of what it has done to Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.703" offset="4803605">I would also note with regard to the voluntariness of pregnancy that the appellees have conceded that most births are desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.159" offset="4845401">On the other hand, the disability fund which compensates for illness and injuries involves misfortunes and accidents and the kind of thing, disease and accident are the kinds of things which no one ever desires and because of that basic distinction in the desirability and the voluntariness of the condition, there is a significantly greater incidence of planned use of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.236" offset="4949682">While it’s true, you may put off a cataract operation until next year so that to that extent you could plan the timing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.632" offset="5499298">The issue in this case is not as appellant states whether women should receive benefits for normal pregnancy under California’s Disability Insurance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.771" offset="5539840">We do not and could not contend that pregnancy itself is a medical disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.912" offset="5564395">Rather, the issue in this case is whether a denial of benefits to otherwise qualified workers is justified solely because their illness or injury arises from normal pregnancy and child birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.276" offset="5621864">The purpose of the California Disability Program is to compensate in part for wage loss because of sickness or injury and to reduce to a minimum the suffering caused by the resulting unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.863" offset="5672229">In carrying out the program’s liberal purposes, California compensates every conceivable disability without regard to its voluntariness, uniqueness, predictability or cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.513" offset="5726772">Thus, the program compensates workers disabled by costly disabilities such as heart attacks, sex and race unique disabilities such as prostatectomies or sickle cell anemia; voluntary disability such as cosmetic surgery, sterilization or orthodonture and pre-existing conditions which will inevitably result in disability such as degenerative arthritis or cataract operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.809" offset="6243997">I think the primary point here is that the only group chosen to bear the burden of an exclusion under the fund is a group whose choice, with respect to pregnancy is a protected one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.699" offset="6291540">Whether the person chooses to terminate the pregnancy or carry the pregnancy out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.429" offset="6314423">Under the California program, she uniquely bears the burden of an exclusion from a program that assists every other worker who might be disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.993" offset="6364682">The sole criterion for granting benefits for any of the disabilities that I just mentioned that are covered by the program is whether the worker is medically disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.824" offset="6408046">Women disabled by childbirth meet this medical criterion and like other workers, suffer from the attendant wage loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.692" offset="6443468">Given that this disabled class of women is similarly situated with respect to the program's stated major purposes, we might ask whether scrutiny of the program structure and operation reveals unstated but no less clear evidence of legislative purposes which would explain this singular exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.382" offset="6522253">Quite plainly they do not. California has created a wholly pooled risk program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.421" offset="6550465">Workers contribute a flat percentage of their income to the fund and benefits are paid according to a statutory scale based on wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.737" offset="6587664">The California program excludes no adverse risk groups and in fact prohibits groups of low risk workers from, belonging to separate plants at lower cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.943" offset="6632490">Rather than categorized workers on the basis of actuarial factors, California has chosen to pool high and low risk workers in one comprehensive fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.091" offset="6677107">Age and income level, two of the most accurate predictors of disability risk according to California’s own and national statistics, are irrelevant to an individual worker’s contribution rate or eligibility for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.030" offset="6736875">California does not even compile statistics on disability experienced by race, although national health survey statistics published by HEW indicate that the gap between disability days on the basis of race is significantly greater than that based on sex.</text>

            <label>Ms. Wendy W. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="1756.076" offset="7101022">Men per se do not pay in more and get out less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.448" offset="7114501">That is not the predictive factor under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.301" offset="7129966">The first and major predictive factor is of course wage level, the California program is structured so as to benefit low wage earners at a disproportionate rate to high wage earners so that a low wage earner would receive a 65% wage replacement whereas a high income wage earner would receive approximately 55% wage replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.306" offset="7225992">For this reason, the difference in the income level between men and women explains almost totally the difference in contributions received from the fund, in the benefits paid by the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.075" offset="7285029">There is an additional factor however that I would mention since the state has put considerable emphasis on it and that is that wage level aside, women suffer a far larger number of disabilities than men do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.984" offset="7344692">This is simply not borne out by the facts, the State’s own facts or any others, the actual difference in the disability rate is in California, that women receive 44% of the benefits and they are 40% of the workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.901" offset="7416372">I am sorry, let me correct that, they filed 44% of the claims and they are 40% of the workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.041" offset="7440927">In addition, the average duration for disabilities between men and women is approximately the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.320" offset="7502054">Now, I think that the other factor that is important in determining whether sex is the predictive factor is to look at the disability rates of persons at different income levels and there again we find that the low wage earners have a higher disability rate and of course women are among the low income group and consequently do suffer a higher disability rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.088" offset="7605081">Now, what this all amounts to, is that sex is not the primary predictive factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.525" offset="7634860">The primary predictive factor, in both respects that I mentioned is the wage level and for California to urge that women receive a disproportionate amount of the funds is another example of using the sex of women against them when it really has nothing to do with the benefits they receive or the contributions they make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.468" offset="7742589">Now, appellant’s main contention, as I understand it and really sole contention is that the cost of coverage of child birth related disabilities is just so extraordinarily expensive that it would be impossible to maintain a program supported by employee contributions if these disabilities were included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.588" offset="7835063">As the District Court found, even using appellant’s estimate of cost, it is clear that including these disabilities would not destroy the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.107" offset="7873202">The legislature could accommodate these costs quite easily by making reasonable changes in the contribution rate, the maximum benefits allowable or other factors affecting the solvency of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.713" offset="7923566">Even by appellant’s own estimate, the difference that any individual worker would have to pay per month to the fund amounts to $2.00 under our estimate which is about half as large, that amount would be $1.00 in addition per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.276" offset="7997858">Now, the primary factor which accounts for the difference in our estimate of the cost of this particular disability is the duration estimated by the appellants as compared to the estimate of duration which we derived from common medical understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.851" offset="8088137">A conservative estimate made by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is that the disability resulting from child birth will average six to eight weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.229" offset="8133695">This is approximately half of the duration estimated by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.360" offset="8158145">In fact, many of the doctors surveyed by appellant in the survey which he attaches to his primary brief estimate that the average duration of disability is less than six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.056" offset="8213002">We don’t ask this Court to make a finding of the average number of weeks of disability due to child birth, we simply point out that doctors almost uniformly agree that the average is at most half of the estimate of the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.690" offset="8275487">In a 12-hour attempt to justify its cost estimates, appellant attaches as appendix B to his brief, a chart purporting to show that one half of New Jersey’s benefit payments are paid for pregnancy related disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.315" offset="8342047">Because these figures so distorts the actual situation in the state of New Jersey, appellees would request the opportunity to submit within ten days a short explanation of the true facts when they can be gathered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.228" offset="8409652">Briefly explained, the figure submitted by appellant are misrepresentative because they show benefit payments under only one of New Jersey’s three separate disability funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.878" offset="8468271">The fund mentioned or shown in the chart attached to the reply brief is the disability during unemployment fund which pays out only 10% or so of all benefits but almost all pregnancy claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.621" offset="8539220">Employers commonly lay off pregnant women some weeks prior to disability in that state, thereby necessitating their claims go under this unemployment fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.553" offset="8586971">New Jersey’s total experience is that child birth related benefits comprise only 8% or 9% of total program benefits, according to the figures which we’ve been able to derive and will submit to the Court within ten days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.468" offset="8650606">In the final analysis, the exclusion of birth related disabilities is solely a matter of cost as I have indicated before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.395" offset="8686341">The meager legislative history available to us suggests no other basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.755" offset="8711732">The California legislature which enacted the program in 1946 looked to and learned from the only state disability program then in existence, the Rhode Island program created four years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.541" offset="8762932">Rhode Island’s program, in its early years had severe financial problems which California sought to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.021" offset="8792816">One major drain on the Rhode Island program’s funds was the cost of paying benefits for pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.213" offset="8817580">The major reason for this high cost was the fact that Rhode Island paid benefits to a woman simply because she was pregnant without requiring a showing of actual physical disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.664" offset="8867422">California, rather than control for this over generous interpretation of pregnancy related disability excluded such disabilities from the fund all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.954" offset="8912562">The desire to save money cannot justify and otherwise invidious classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.327" offset="8942028">In Shapiro versus Thompson, this Court confronted the determination of Congress in at least 40 states that public money should not be spent on welfare aid to new residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.476" offset="8986645">The primary reason for that one year residency requirement was the legislature’s desire to save welfare cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.496" offset="9018723">This Court held that the Constitution required inclusion of the class deliberately excluded by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.726" offset="9043696">Significantly although this Court closely scrutinized the classification in Shapiro it indicated that the one year residence requirement was vulnerable even under the traditional, more lenient rational basis standard of equal protection review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.164" offset="9221433">That footnote states that a state disability program would be entitled to tie benefits to contribution rate which California now does by its flat 1% rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.429" offset="9282456">That is not inconsistent with our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.535" offset="9302936">Indeed to permit differential treatment on the basis of sex solely because the state wishes to save money when perhaps the most pervasive form of discrimination against women is economic, is to perpetuate the historical discrimination against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.229" offset="9365629">Equality for women, as equality for black persons has done and will continue to do, cost money as the experience under Title VII in the Equal Pay Act demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.761" offset="9419755">Nowhere is the economic discrimination against women more apparent than in the rules and practices surrounding the reality that women are the bearers of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.185" offset="9461447">This role which calls for stereotyped notions that women belong in the home with their children that women are not serious members of the workforce and that women generally have a male breadwinner in their families to support them has resulted in laws which force able bodied women off the job which denies them unemployment insurance once they have gone on mandatory maternity leave, denies them sick leave when their disability results from pregnancy and disability insurance as well which does not permit them to return to work at the time when they become physically able, often denies them seniority and other benefits which accrue to workers normally disabled and finally when they try to return to the job, often the jobs themselves are denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.690" offset="9667500">In light of these realities, Judge Hainsworth’s conclusion in Cohen versus Chesterfield County School Board 474 F. 2d that, “The fact that only women experience pregnancy and motherhood removes all possibility of competition in this area is simply false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.671" offset="9739389">Rather, women who become pregnant suffer a serious competitive disadvantage not because their physiological state renders it inevitable and unavoidable but because of over broad and arbitrary rules concerning that physiological state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.651" offset="9823399">An example of the kind of discriminatory notions upon which the state is focused and made its arguments are two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.379" offset="9870315">One of the kind I just mentioned and another kind which I will describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.155" offset="9885362">The first is that the reason for the 15-week duration is that women will have to go on mandatory maternity leave before they are physically disabled and the doctors will provide for compensation during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.486" offset="9942727">The second is that doctors, being sympathetic people, will take into consideration grounds other than medical grounds in determining whether a woman continues to be disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.734" offset="9991732">This first ground, or rather both grounds assume that doctors will not make medical judgments in determining whether or not a woman is physically disabled because of child birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.077" offset="10045022">I think there’s no basis for that and in fact as Mr. Chief Justice Burger mentioned in the Roe opinion, doctors are a group likely to carry out their professional responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.032" offset="10096849">There may well be problems at first in California, as there were in Rhode Island, in educating people as to what a disability related to pregnancy is and what I mean by that is the state itself has shown confusion between childbearing leave and disability leave and it may be that doctors will have to be informed as to what’s expected of them in submitting disability verifications, that doctors will collude with women in order to get them benefits which they don’t deserve, I think is contrary to reality however.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.351" offset="10266122">Now, it has been said that disability, that discrimination based upon pregnancy should not be considered to be sex discrimination for several reasons, the main one being that women are not in competition with men in this area and in addition, that it is a unique characteristic and those arguments are related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.188" offset="10373538">It’s only true that pregnancy is unique and there is no competition in situations in which the law is narrowly and carefully drawn so that the purposes are so stated that all that could possibly be covered in that situation as pregnancy and pregnancy exclusions would not be irrationally categorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.994" offset="10472699">Let me give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.334" offset="10486073">A law which said that a woman was entitled to nursing leave after the birth of a child would be a rational statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.953" offset="10516584">The reason for that is that only mothers can nurse children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.579" offset="10535079">If it was a leave which said mothers can take time off to care for their children after birth, that may well discriminate against fathers who are perfectly capable of taking care of their children in ways other than nursing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.296" offset="10589936">Most of the laws which we have discussed here today and which are exemplified by the practice struck down in Cohen and LaFleur however, affect women in an area where they truly do compete with men and put them in a serious disadvantage, not just at the time that they go out of the workforce but sometimes in terms of their whole working lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.491" offset="10694740">Now, there are a number of reasons why discrimination on the basis of pregnancy should be considered sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.344" offset="10738103">Historically, we have seen in cases like Bradwell, in cases like Muller, in cases like Hoyt, the very justification for the discrimination against women in those cases was primarily based on their childbearing function and the role which was assumed to grow out of that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.310" offset="10818038">Now as time has gone on, these generalized discriminations based on pregnancy, which for example kept women out of the legal profession for a number of years have gradually been struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.873" offset="10884284">But what remains is the narrow area in which these unique sex characteristics prevent women from full participation in the labor force not because of their physical state but because of rules which exclude them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.413" offset="10954397">Now in Frontiero versus Laird, the plurality in that case stated that the reason for scrutinizing sex based classifications in part was that stereotypes and generalizations had so grown up around the status of women that laws often discriminated against them, not on any real factors, but because of these stereotypes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.277" offset="11073829">Pregnancy presents a primary example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.550" offset="11086994">Women are thought of on the one hand as completely disabled during the whole pregnancy and in the next moment the state can assert that women are not disabled at all and should be excluded from a disability program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.432" offset="11230459">Any common medical test will indicate that when a woman goes through the birth process, her entire birth canal is to some extent damaged by her giving birth that when the child emerges, she often has a surgical procedure called an Episiotomy which is disabling to her for some period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.432" offset="11322514">Interestingly enough the state will compensate if the child is delivered through a surgical incision in the abdomen but will not do so when there is a surgical incision at the end of the birth canal, that women suffer disabilities for other physical reasons such as a change in their hormone level immediately following birth is also clear and well-established in the medical text.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.328" offset="11438080">The centrality of women’s biological reproductive role to historical and current discrimination against women on the basis of sex stereotypes concerning that role leads to the inescapable conclusion, so long as classifications based upon pregnancy are thrust outside the bounds of judicial scrutiny.</text>

            <label>Ms. Joanne Condas</label>
            <text syncTime="3194.353" offset="12854126">I should like to respond to the question concerning further legislative consideration of inclusion of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.947" offset="12888503">It’s a matter that comes up every year because of course, the legislature is always confronted with the request to reallocate benefits among groups different ways and I should like to call the Court’s attention to Judge William’s discussion in his dissent from the opinion which is contained in the appendix to our jurisdictional statement at page 22 and 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.964" offset="12988604">He discusses the transmogrifications that Senate Bill 419 went through and there were statistical presentations made to the senate committees that considered that so that from a Bill which began by offering maternity benefits of 15 weeks at a cost increase up to 73% in the premium, the Bill finally emerged in the form of one treating only abnormal and involuntary complications of pregnancy and I would also like to respond to the discussion of that involuntary terminations or involuntary complications and why that word is used in the existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.940" offset="13152549">There is still a good deal of social controversy over granting a woman the right to have an abortion, must the public pay for it when a significant segment of the public still has philosophical objections to doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.822" offset="13208033">As a consequence, the bill emerged that way after full legislative discussion and a good deal of interplay among interested groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.077" offset="13241051">I would like to reiterate the five factors that I discussed before and it seems to me in a way that what I am talking about is sort of like the blind man examining an elephant, that if you just talk about the voluntariness, you can find other conditions that are somewhat voluntary and if you just talk about the duration, you can find other conditions that have long duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.116" offset="13337182">And if you just talk about the cost, you can probably find others that somewhat approached the cost of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.867" offset="13364245">But if you take all of those five factors together --</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.109" offset="13381172">I beg your pardon?</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.967" offset="13388591">Well the -- alright, the difference in medical standards and I would like to respond particularly to the statement which is in the appellee’s brief concerning the position of the American physicians and gynecologists on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.455" offset="13454524">It may be that they say one thing in one context and they do another thing in another context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.292" offset="13477930">For example, the Railroad Retirement Board provides full pregnancy benefits for disability from pregnancy and the statistics contained in the report of the Railroad Retirement Board covering 1970 and 1971 average per beneficiary 110 days per pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.170" offset="13565388">Now those are all based again on medical certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.358" offset="13578136">So it’s clear that doctors are willing to be a little bit more generous and I submit to you that one of the reasons is it’s not unlike what Professor Thomas Reed Powell said in connection with having a legal mind, that if you can think of one thing and not think of the other thing that’s inextricably interwoven with it, then you have a legal mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.616" offset="13655249">Well, I believe that’s the condition that a physician is in, in treating a mother with a newborn child and in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.085" offset="13689104">Let me call to your attention the brief, the amicus curiae brief filed in this case by the physician’s forum and at page 2 of that brief, in discussing why they have an interest in this case, they say three times, the health of the perspective mother and child, the health of working women and their children, and the health of the women or the fetus, all are reasons why the disability of pregnancy should be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.133" offset="13797251">Well, I think that’s just a fairly clear indication that doctors have in conservative medical judgments quite proper concern for the mother and the newborn child together and they are simply not going to be able to sort out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.947" offset="13852526">The mother is not disabled but the newborn baby would be better off if she were with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.921" offset="13872483">I just believe that’s not going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.786" offset="13883873">I should also like to comment that California has always had a concern about the higher cost of covering women under disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.101" offset="13917100">There is no dearth of legislative history here, there has been in the regulations from almost the very beginning, a restriction that relates to private plans which were a significantly greater factor in earlier days and that regulation which is in the California Administrative Code Title 22 Section 3254 (h) require that private plans include at least 20% women and it was obviously perhaps an in artful but it was certainly an effort to require that funds have some balance to compensate for the fact that women simply cost more to cover under disability plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.516" offset="14070805">Herbert Dennenberg, Commissioner of Insurance at the State of Pennsylvania who is no friend of the insurance industry has consistently acknowledged that it costs between two and three times the same amount to cover women as it does men without covering pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.173" offset="14141440">But finally, I would just to leave this one thought, that we are not talking about adding a new class of beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.911" offset="14168398">There is not a single woman who would be brought into the class of beneficiaries who is not there now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.215" offset="14193580">Every woman who is eligible for disability insurance in California is getting disability insurance coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.486" offset="14218658">The result of this decision would be to skew that benefit package so that a small percentage of the women get the lion share of the benefits and when our state court had this question before it in 1958, that was exactly the problem that they foresaw and exactly why they felt it was a legislative decision to decide how to treat pregnancy, whether to exclude it entirely, to put a long durational requirement which is all they did in the beginning to extend the durational requirement or simply to compensate complications of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.258" offset="14349793">That was a decision that the legislature made and has consistently reexamined with legislative bills that come up just about every year and it just seems to me to be almost inconceivable that we could allow this disproportion to grow larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.815" offset="14407993">I submit that if pregnancy is required to be covered, we can expect that approximately 2% of the workforce in California will collect more than 30% of the benefits and this is arrived at very simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.501" offset="14462746">It is established that approximately 5% of the women in the workforce become pregnant each year and even if you were to assume that the workforce is made up of 50% women.</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.290" offset="14537874">You then have a condition where you know what the pregnancy benefits are going to be, they are going to be an admitted 30 to 40% increase in the cost so you have whatever small percentage of women who become pregnant each year, taking down a total of 30% of the added cost of the administration of the fund and I submit that to do that under the guides of equal protection or due process would seem to me to be a very surprising result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.350" offset="14654171">For that reason, California urges that the District Court decision be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3708.320" offset="14910067">The different medical standard, which necessarily pertains, we don’t believe that that’s a matter of fraud and collusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.854" offset="14936189">We believe it’s a matter of sound medical judgment in the interest of the mother and child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.849" offset="14956147">A physician in that area of medical practice would be remised not to take that into account and also the rate of return to work following pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.069" offset="14997002">Since we have not covered pregnancy, we admittedly have no statistics of our own on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.207" offset="15021558">The amicus curiae briefs filed by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and by General Electric Company in this case indicate that their experience is approximately a 50% rate of return.</text>
