            <text syncTime="8.243" offset="109714">Mr. Chief Justice and If it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.813" offset="124029">My name Robert Friebert and I represent the petitioner Douglas Raymond Dorszynski.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.984" offset="144718">The respondent is United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.092" offset="157153">This case involves a petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and this case originally arose out of an appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, the Honorable Myron L. Gordon presiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.683" offset="223504">The issue involves an interpretation of the Federal Youth Corrections Act and in particular, the issue involves the procedural requirements which must be met before a youth offender can be sentenced as an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.147" offset="285362">The Act and the particular point in question states as follows and this is Title 18 5010 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="63.501" offset="330710">“If the court shall find that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under the “Act” then the court may sentence the youth offender under any other applicable penalty provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="81.715" offset="403644">Synthesized further then, the issue before the Court here is whether a sentencing court, sentencing a youth offender who is a defendant under the age of 22 must articulate its findings of no benefit on the record and further whether the sentencing court must support that finding with reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.748" offset="507716">The facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.959" offset="516598">Petitioner Douglas Dorszynski was convicted of possession of LSD in violation of 21 U.S.(c). 844 (a) at a time when he was 19 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.437" offset="574485">He was no longer juvenile, but he was subject to the provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.596" offset="603115">The particular charge involved was a misdemeanor, subjecting him to a maximum penalty were he simply an adult to one year in jail or a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.793" offset="655882">The petitioner pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.435" offset="666540">The trial court sentenced the petitioner to a split sentence of 90 days in jail to be followed by a probationary period outside of jail for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.788" offset="719935">At the time of his arraignment and his plea of guilty, he was not told that he could be sentenced under the Federal Youth Corrections Act for period of control or in essence of about six years with four years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.112" offset="789211">At the sentencing proceeding, the trial court never mentioned the Federal Youth Corrections Act when it imposed its sentence as an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.193" offset="841561">Post trial motions were filed which challenged the adult’s sentence and challenged it in particular on the grounds that the trial court had made no findings on his reasons why he rejected a sentence under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.128" offset="921287">At the time of the post trial motions, the sentencing court stated that the Act was not applicable and he further stated that he, when he sentenced the youth offender as an adult that there was implied finding on his behalf and he said no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.581" offset="1011043">The Court of Appeals agreed that the Trial Judge did not have to explain his reasons in any way as to why he did not sentence under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, or why he made a finding of no benefit under the Act and affirmed this aspect of the case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="254.367" offset="1094217">I have the impression that somewhere in the record, the United States Attorney had referred to the youth -- the Act was at the arraignment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Friebert</label>
            <text syncTime="263.194" offset="1129535">Yes, the Act was referred to twice at the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.176" offset="1145417">It was under the provisions of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.625" offset="1167256">The defendant stated that he was going to plead guilty and the pre-sentence investigation was done before he came into courts so the proceedings at the arraignment was also a sentencing proceeding with benefit of a pre-sentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.898" offset="1224307">The United States Attorney in court stated that the defendant was a youth offender and subject to the Youth Offender’s Act, but he did not state that the Youth Offender’s Act subjected the petitioner to potential four years incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.049" offset="1292957">This was followed by the same Assistant United States Attorney stating that the penalty maximum was one year which was an incorrect statement of the law under the circumstances because the maximum penalty was six years in actuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.270" offset="1361816">Then the judge made that statement and further emphasized the one year maximum to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.329" offset="1398073">After the plea of guilty was entered, the court recessed to consider the pre-sentence investigation report which had been previously prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.393" offset="1442273">Upon reconvening, the Federal Youth Corrections Act was mentioned the second time, and that was by the petitioner’s counsel at that time who asked that probation be given to the petitioner and that this probation be under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.224" offset="1513639">The trial court then imposed the split sentence of 90 days in custody to be followed by two years probation without in any way commenting upon the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.660" offset="1571422">The only time the trial court commented on the Act was in the post conviction hearings when he said that a finding that the Act was inapplicable could be implied from the record in the case and he stated no reasons in the post trial, post conviction hearing’s either.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.626" offset="13971226">The judge has the discretion to sentence the defendant to probation for up to one year and if the defendant satisfactorily completes that probation, then he is automatically entitled to have the proceeding set aside and completely expunged for all purposes, a far and more comprehensive relief then is available under the Youth Corrections Act and it is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.815" offset="14064013">In the present case, let us take petitioner’s scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.498" offset="14082717">If this Court were to reverse and send it back for re-sentencing, if he was sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act, and if he received probation and we do not necessarily agree that that is the only alternative on remand, but if he did receive such probation, he would not be entitled to have his conviction set aside upon the completion of that probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.884" offset="14168294">The only time he can have it set aside is if the judge in the court and its discretion decides to discharge him from probation prior to the term set.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.416" offset="14218449">It is only for premature or early release that this remedy is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.876" offset="14248229">So, it is not mandatory as it would have been under 844.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.766" offset="14263798">Yet under the petitioner's own argument, the District Court would have been disabled from sentencing him under 844 unless he first concluded that he was incorrigible or will not derive benefit from treatment under (b) or (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.707" offset="14319595">Now, he might well have thought that maybe he will derive some benefit but it is not worth subjecting him to the added risks of extended incarceration that would be involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.766" offset="14539860">Well, it is -- first of all, he would not be entitled to expungement as such under the provisions of the Youth Act unless he were discharged from probation or released from commitment prior to the term that's set.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.907" offset="14616346">So, it really matter of speculation whether that situation would over arise were he sentenced under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.021" offset="14728882">The words of Section 5021 which provide for expungement are simply refer to youth offender who has been on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.066" offset="14772976">And the structure of the Act, it appears to refer to probation under 5010 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.065" offset="14793038">Explicitly, it is not limited to that and whether it would refer to probation under 3651 which the petitioner received is an open question which are not this Court certainly has not resolved.</text>
