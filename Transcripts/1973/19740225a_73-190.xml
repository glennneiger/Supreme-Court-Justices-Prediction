            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ will hear arguments first this morning in number 73-190, Bellis against The United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.584" offset="119118">Mr. Sarner, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_sarner" startTime="13.694" stopTime="417.032">
            <label>Mr. Leonard Sarner</label>
            <text syncTime="13.694" offset="131553">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, the issue presented here is whether the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to books and records of this law closely held partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.807" offset="191948">In our petition for certiorari, we said that the court never directly decided this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.801" offset="219951">In retrospect, I’m satisfied that the court did decide it in the Boyd case, decided in the favor of the position of the petitioner, and that this has been reaffirmed by the formulation which this Court enunciated in White.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.387" offset="282331">The case is brought up in the context of the small three-man law partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.033" offset="312842">Petitioner is in lawful possession of the books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.560" offset="331024">The subpoena is addressed to him from the federal grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.833" offset="348056">Thus, we have here the ingredient of personal compulsion, which this Court found lacking in Couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.347" offset="382119">As a co-owner, rightful possession of the books, we submit that the petitioner’s Fifth Amendment claim against self-incrimination must be recognized unless there is something significantly unique about the nature of the books and records of a small law partnership to require a difference in result and we also submit that there is not anything unique about these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.131" offset="493296">Your Honors will note that the Government is quick and perhaps, we think a little too quick to point out that although Boyd involved a subpoena addressed to a partnership to which the partner responded, the court says -- the court according to the Government says that this was ignored by the Boyd court that this crucial fact, that the punishable aspect of the case was disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.573" offset="607086">Now, if Your Honors will note, Boyd did involve a charge by the Government at some 35 cases of plate glass had been imported to this country from England by the firm, the partnership firm of E.A. Boyd and Sons, by means of the fraudulent or false invoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.875" offset="684199">And the subpoena was directed to the partnership providing for the production of an invoice from the English seller of this glass showing the quantity and quality and value of glass contained in 29 of these 35 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.489" offset="762671">Now, the emphasis Your Honors by the Boyd court that a man’s private papers cannot be used to established a criminal charge against him where the private paper was the invoice of the foreign shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.358" offset="818155">Hardly, as the Government characterizes it in its brief, a partner’s private written statements, this was an invoice from the foreign shipper, first indicates and that the private papers referred to in Boyd didn’t refer to the manner of the preparation or writing by the intimacy of the information contained therein, but rather to the ownership aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.150" offset="921391">First, that this was considered to be the private paper of the claimant of the partnership and the partner standing in the shoes of the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.106" offset="957127">Of course, as Wilson points out that was never required for Fifth Amendment privilege that the documents be written by the person himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.628" offset="1007282">In fact that in Wilson, it was emphasized that the mere fact that the officer of the corporation may have written in his own handwriting, the incriminating material in the corporate books in no way would either enlarge or take away from the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.188" offset="1073528">But Your Honors, we submit it’s too much to suggest as I think the Government does that the Boyd court ignored the other aspect of private papers which was involved in Boyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.997" offset="1124728">That is the private papers’ concept as opposed to those quasi-public records required by law to be kept for regulatory purposes justifying in public scrutiny and you know some area of public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.324" offset="1186064">Now, it should be noted that the rationale as we understand it for denying Fifth Amendment protection to corporate books and records lies in the visitorial powers doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.592" offset="1243115">The interest of the States, of the Government to inspect and regulate that state created creatures as exemplified merely by the required records doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.952" offset="1296509">Thus, the Boyd court was well aware what this Court in Hale versus Henkel, 10 years later, only 10 years later held about the required records doctrine when the Boyd court itself observed that what was involved in Boyd, in the private papers aspect was completely different from -- this is the quotation, “the supervision which was authorized to be exercised by revenue officers over the manufacture or custody of excisable articles and the entries there open books required by law to be kept for their inspection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="345.171" offset="1457424">Thus, Boyd specifically recognized the distinction between private papers of a partnership and the required records of a corporation with partnership papers assimilated to privately or individually owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.446" offset="1526491">Furthermore Your Honors, we submit that the White formulation in essence adopts this exact approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.791" offset="1559928">Now, White recognized the necessity for governmental power to regulate and inspect economically, influential, unincorporated associations such as the union involved therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.983" offset="1620637">Despite the non-applicability of the visitorial powers doctrine, the privilege applying to recast the White formulation in the affirmative rather than in negative where the organization has a character so personal, that has been substantially identical, in scope of membership and activities, that it can be said to embody or represent the purely, private or personal that is the intimate identical interest of its constituents.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.612" offset="2431164">Well, You Honor, I would think that if one of the partners of Mr. Bellis did surrender the records and another one, Mr. Kolsby got to say, “We’re now involved in a criminal investigation” that Mr. Kolsby would not be able to claim that there was any violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.494" offset="2506710">At least under the rationale of Couch, the personal compulsion was addressed to Mr. Bellis.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.879" offset="2540251">It wasn’t addressed to one of the other partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.872" offset="2556238">So unless you adopt Your Honor may be referring to that the possession was so constructive or fleeting in one of the partners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.780" offset="7399863">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.897" offset="7420343">The records at issue here are the financial records of a law partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.890" offset="7448346">The production order which is set forth on page 116 of the appendix excludes any individual client files containing any advice or confidential relationships between the Attorney and the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.039" offset="7540924">There essentially -- essentially, we are dealing here with a production order enforcing a grand jury subpoena for the financial records of the partnership, the receipts and disbursements record of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.389" offset="7614276">The claim is that the partner in possession is entitled to assert the Fifth Amendment claim that this would violate the provision stating that no person shall be compelled at any criminal case to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.060" offset="7701002">This is a provision, the background of which has been reviewed by the Court many times in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.372" offset="7734230">Last term in the Couch opinion, the Court noted that historically, the privilege was to protect the individual from resort by the state to the expedient of compelling incriminating evidence from the individuals on mouth as the Court put it in Couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.459" offset="7834540">And in light of the language of the amendment and its historical background, the view has been expressed by members of the Court, including Mr. Justice Stewart, that perhaps the privilege might have been intended to be restricted to the protection of the testimony and judicial proceedings, and only to bar the compulsion of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.937" offset="7944464">But in the Boyd case in 116 U.S., the Court did extend the privilege also to the compulsion of the production of a person’s papers in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.377" offset="8014263">Now, it was only the issue in Boyd didn’t -- the parties in Boyd and the court in Boyd didn’t address the problem of the relationship between an individual and an association or a group with whom he was related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.552" offset="8082913">The entire issue was whether the privilege would be extended beyond testimonial compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.211" offset="8113633">And as the Court noted in the Shapiro case, the Government in essence contended that the privilege didn’t extend to in rem proceedings of any kind that it only extended to in personam proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.167" offset="8193463">But the fact that these were partnership records in the Boyd case simply wasn’t discussed either by the parties or in the Court’s opinion which treated them as Mr. Boyd’s personal papers and several times in the principle passages of the Boyd opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.212" offset="8261590">The Court referred to these as personal papers as it has insubsequently referring to the Boyd holding in United States against White and also in the Couch case last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.609" offset="8323135">It was only after Boyd was decided and the privilege was thus extended that the issue arose as to the records of entities other than natural individuals and the rights of individuals who are parts of those entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.422" offset="8406413">And throughout that entire series of cases, the Court has been very conscious of the basic concept that’s implicit in the history of the amendment, and that was also restated last term in the Couch case that in its nature, the privilege is an intimate and personal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.762" offset="8511843">And even in the context of its extension to the production of papers or perhaps of other effects, this personal element of the privilege and the personal delimitation of the privilege has been emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.913" offset="8588434">And accordingly in the series of cases beginning with Hale against Henkel through United States against White and its progeny, the Court first held that the privilege is not available to a corporation or to an unincorporated organization of any kind, although there was no specific discussion of partnerships, but the rational of the White case which extended this was -- that the privilege is not extend to “the records of any organization, whether it be incorporated or not”, but that it is “limited to its historic function of protecting only the natural individual from compulsory incrimination through his own testimony or personal records.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.209" offset="8817580">Now, there is a possible limitation on that principle expressed in dictum in the White case to which I will return in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.244" offset="8857704">The other aspect involved in the series of cases and slightly more difficult aspect in light of the Boyd holding is, what about the individual through whom the state seeks to compel the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.890" offset="8960313">The Government seeks to compel the production of the group’s records isn’t he being force to come forward in producing them and identify and authenticate what might incriminate him?</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.770" offset="9019873">And doesn’t that run into the essence of the Boyd holding or as it was re-expressed not long ago by the Court in Schmerber against California that the privilege extends not only to testimony, but also to responses which are themselves communications such as the production of one’s papers citing the Boyd case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.418" offset="9146410">Well, the Court has rejected that argument in the context of compulsory production by an individual who is holding papers in a representative capacity so long as the production order requires in to do no more than produced papers that he is holding in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.622" offset="9247242">We’re not dealing here with the situation where the production order says that he is to produce such records of the partnership as will show that you, Isadore Bellis under reported your income tax so that the production would be any -- would constitute more the communication --</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.608" offset="10239164">This exception was reiterated in United States against White with respect to association records, and the custodian in that case of the labor union records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.370" offset="10294230">And the Court there, I’m quoting on page 699 of volume 322 put it this way, “But individuals when acting as representatives of a collective group cannot be said to be exercising their personal rights and duties, nor to be entitled to their purely personal privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.055" offset="10368940">Rather, they assume the rights, duties and privileges of the artificial entity or association in which there are agents or officers and they are bound by its obligations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.677" offset="10407497">In their official capacity therefore, they have no privilege again self-incrimination at least to the extent of having to comply with the production of order when they are the custodian of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.544" offset="10482939">That it seems to be the basic rationale of these series of cases and I think in light of the Couch in particular which holds that financial records of this kind if properly secured by the Government are admissible in evidence over a Fifth Amendment claim by their owner, the rationale about authentication and identification of the records becomes really what is left of the Boyd holding as I understand --</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.996" offset="13584718">Our contention bases it on the legal rights between partners who are associated together in the partnership, and because each individual's partner’s rights are limited with respect to the partnership records by state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.318" offset="13950015">Of course, there can be subpoenas whether they deal with papers or not that would elicit incriminatory information from an individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3545.371" offset="14258260">It’s just implicit in his responding to the subpoena and the consistent holding of this Court’s series of cases dealing with associational records is that that’s an obligation he undertook and undertaking custody of the associational records.</text>
