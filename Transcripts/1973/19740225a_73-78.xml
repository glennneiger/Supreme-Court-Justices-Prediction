            <text syncTime="79.473" offset="394658">Appellant Mel Kahn, a Florida resident is a widower.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.166" offset="421407">In January 1971, based on his status as a surviving spouse, he applied to the Dade County Tax Assessor for a property tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.211" offset="473548">The statute under which widower Kahn sought exemption provided, a widow, along with the disabled persons is entitled to exempt $500 yearly from her property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.068" offset="536973">Mel Khan was denied the claimed exemption solely on the ground of his sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.962" offset="560588">Requesting judicial review, he alleged that the statute under which he claimed exemption have been interpreted and applied in conflict with the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="135.173" offset="617430">Actually he didn’t allege that in the trial, didn’t he expressly say he didn’t want to raise this federal question there?</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="140.756" offset="639791">In the original complaint, he suggested that he might save at the federal question till a later time but then the federal question was raised and decided with the agreement of all parties.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="150.920" stopTime="155.565">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="150.920" offset="680438">But he didn’t simply say he might say but he said he wanted to say that, didn’t he?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="155.565" stopTime="689.711">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="155.565" offset="699037">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.918" offset="700395">But apparently, with the understanding of the court and the agreement of both sides, the federal question was heard and decided both in the trial court and in the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.329" offset="766015">Appellant sought a declaration that the exemption provision is unconstitutional insofar as it excludes widowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.487" offset="802691">On cross motions for summary judgment, the Court of First Instance held that the statute by according exemption to all widows and excluding all widowers discriminated arbitrarily between widowed persons and therefore violated the equal protection guarantees of the State and Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.904" offset="892343">On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.228" offset="905613">The Florida Supreme Court held that the distinction between surviving spouses though based solely on gender did not deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.418" offset="954410">It is appellant’s position that the gender based distinction upheld by the Florida Supreme Court discriminates invidiously in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.839" offset="1000072">First, most obviously, it discriminates against men who have lost their wives more subtly but as surely it discounts the contribution made to the marital unit and the family academy by the female partner for her death, occasions no exemption for the surviving spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.309" offset="1089933">By defining the exempt person as widow, rather than surviving spouse, this provision now covering the blind and the totally disabled along with the widow is keen to a classification delineated by the president of one of our nation’s leading educational institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.010" offset="1176764">Anticipating an increase in conscription not too many years ago, this distinguished educator complained, “We shall be left with the blind, the lame, and the women.”</text>
            <text syncTime="289.151" offset="1233398">This Court’s decision in Reed v. Reed 404 U.S. and its judgment in Frontiero v. Richardson 411 U.S. indicate genuine concern to analyze sex classifications free from the generalizations of the Victorian age.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.539" offset="1306854">Appellant maintains that the Reed standard is not met by a surviving spouse, tax exemption that uses gender as the sole criterion for qualification or if need is the concern then sex should not be a substitute for an income test.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.724" offset="1383654">And if widowed state is the concern, then it is irrational to distinguish between taxpayers based on their sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.541" offset="1418867">Far from constituting a rational shorthand but distinguishing between taxpayers on the basis of need or life situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.553" offset="1450945">A widow’s only classification is a crude device that originated in and today perpetuates Victorian assumptions concerning the station of men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.655" offset="1507370">To resolve this case, the Court need not go beyond the scrutiny employed in Reed and followed by the Tenth Circuit in Moritz v. Commissioner 469 F. 2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.050" offset="1560973">The decision in Reed and the judgment in Frontiero indicate the Court’s clear willingness to give sex classifications more than surface examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.531" offset="1614890">However, if the Court wants to consider application of a suspect classification doctrine then it must face the fact that problems of race and sex discrimination are often different and that neither women nor blacks are aided by lumping the two together for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.023" offset="1716872">Thus far, this Court has applied the label suspect classification only in opinions involving discrimination, hostile to groups not dominant in society.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.513" offset="1770789">But whatever may be said for a one-way suspect classification doctrine in cases involving racial discrimination, a one-way approach in sex discrimination cases would be fought with danger for women because of the historic tendency of jurors to rationalize any special treatment of women as benignly in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.133" offset="1877264">With respect to race, the effects of officially sanctioned segregation are still very much with us but complex doctrines directed to the continuing impact of racial segregation are not necessarily applicable to sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.379" offset="1958243">The difference is perhaps best illustrated with respect to the educational experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.526" offset="1982903">Most public education is co-educational though females have been segregated and restricted in some areas, most notably vocational training and athletics.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.539" offset="2038909">But generally, females participate with males in academic programs, in elementary and high school and in fact, tend to do better there than males.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.823" offset="2091990">For many females, this record of achievement continues into college and university.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.051" offset="2112993">For example, females outscore males on the law school admissions test.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.448" offset="2142563">The problem for women is that along the way, an attitude is instilled insidiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.985" offset="2176731">This attitude is described in a nutshell in graffiti etched on a college library carrel in the early 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.795" offset="2223961">The epigram reads, “Study hard, get good grades, get your degree, get married, have three kids, die, and be buried.”</text>
            <text syncTime="552.081" offset="2285087">From the first drop line, the sex of the writer is impossible to determine from the second, her sex is impossible to mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.103" offset="2329182">To cure the problem, thought so acutely by the young woman who wrote those words and so many others like her, the law must stop using sex as a shorthand for functional description.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.788" offset="2379860">It must deal with the parent not the mother, with the homemaker not the housewife, and with the surviving spouse not the widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.551" offset="2426984">To appreciate the character of the challenged classification, the widow’s only exemption must be viewed in historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.041" offset="2460944">The exemption became part of Florida’s law in 1885.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.430" offset="2478498">At that time, indeed, well into the 20th century, Florida Law routinely differentiated between the roles of men and women and particularly married men and married women.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.084" offset="2529071">Women could not vote nor did they serve on juries for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.814" offset="2547984">Well, past the middle of the 20th century, in fact up till 1968, a Florida married woman could not transfer even her own interest in real property without her husband’s consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.035" offset="2604931">Not surprisingly, the married woman was deemed worthy of special solicitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.719" offset="2627605">On the death of the person, the law regarded as her guardian, her superior not her peer.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.280" offset="2665848">While the widows only exemption was designed with the 19th century status of married woman in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.461" offset="2690612">The Florida Supreme Court found contemporary justification for it in this unquestionable fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.700" offset="2719556">Women workers as a class do not earn as much as man.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.847" offset="2740140">This well known and still wide earnings gap according to the Florida Supreme Court supplies a fair and substantial basis for the tax classification widow rather than surviving spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.704" offset="2803566">But beyond doubt, a widow’s only exemption has no impact whatever on the conditions responsible for the earnings gap.</text>

            <text syncTime="1330.545" offset="5398883">It can either nullify the statute in which case it is totally toward the legislature’s will or it can modify the statute to meet the constitutional equal protection requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.876" offset="5472235">But the court faced with the question, should we take this exemption away from the three quarters of the population, the widow population that now gets it, rather than extend it to the one-quarter that doesn’t in order to preserve what the legislature did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.910" offset="5536392">It seems to me, it’s eminently more destructive of the legislative will to say that we remove this exemption altogether than to say we’ll keep what you wanted and then just add this much smaller group.</text>
