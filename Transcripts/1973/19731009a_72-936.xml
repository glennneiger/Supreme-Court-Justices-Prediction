            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="50.697" offset="279510">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.416" offset="294452">This case as the Court is aware, presents questions quite similar to those raised in Gustafson versus State of Florida which you’ve just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.930" offset="328516">There are also differences, which I have to point out in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.988" offset="344712">But basically, we are concerned here with the scope of a permissible search for weapons, incident to a lawful custodial arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.668" offset="383373">And the arrest here occurred in April of 1968, when Officer Richard Jenks of the Metropolitan Police Department here in the District, arrested the respondent Robinson for the crime of driving after revocation of his operator's permit and for obtaining a permit by misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.058" offset="461009">In the course of a search of Robinson incident to that arrest, Officer Jenks discovered heroin and that heroin became the basis of a prosecution for unlawful possession of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.824" offset="508029">He was convicted of that offense in August of 1969 and an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.102" offset="537182">The procedural history here is a little involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.986" offset="548676">The Court of Appeals, a panel of the Court of Appeals reversed respondent’s conviction on the ground that the seizure had been illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.760" offset="579814">However, the case was then heard en banc by the entire panel -- Court of Appeals and they remanded the case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing, on the scope of the search incident to the April 23rd arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.487" offset="634671">Then after the evidentiary hearing, the en banc court again heard the case and this time, by a vote of five to four held that Officer Jenks’ search had exceeded the scope of a permissible weapon search incident to this arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.547" offset="694962">Now, the facts of the search can be briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.269" offset="713874">The arrest here occurred on April 23rd of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.743" offset="731742">Few days prior to that time, Officer Jenks had stopped the respondent Robinson in a routine traffic check.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.014" offset="760790">He noticed the discrepancy between the birth dates on the respondent’s temporary operator’s permit and the birth date on his draft card.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.119" offset="1129221">Well, I thought you were relying on the fact that this was something called a routine traffic.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="269.133" offset="1153254">I’m relying in the last analysis on the fact that this is a conceitedly lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.029" offset="1176869">Now, I did -- perhaps Your Honor is confused between the dates and I was trying to make a distinction between the date of April 19th when this stop occurred and the license check was made because no arrest was made at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.034" offset="1232875">And it was only later after the officer had checked those dates which where he saw the discrepancy through the traffic records and discovered by checking those dates that Robinson’s regular operators permit had been previously revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.578" offset="1295047">But going back to the original stop, that was never questioned throughout this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.425" offset="1314482">There was a question in the initial trial of this case when Robinson’s had a different trial counsel where he suggested that perhaps the scope of the routine traffic check was excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.892" offset="1360353">That it was permissible and under the Mincey case in the District, it has been held permissible to make these stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.604" offset="1387207">But he suggested that having received the temporary operator’s permit, he had no right to look at the draft card.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.500" offset="1410717">Now that argument did not prevail in the District Court and has not been advanced since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.951" offset="1432555">And I think for the purposes of this Court, we have to assume as the Court of Appeals did and as has every Court which has considered the matter that this routine traffic check was permissible and lawful.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="350.610" stopTime="355.634">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="350.610" offset="1479158">But whether it was or not, I gather there's no challenge to the arrest here, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_a_tuttle" startTime="355.634" stopTime="565.805">
            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="355.634" offset="1499324">There is no challenge to the arrest here in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.194" offset="1521476">I want to come to a question which is brooded in the brief a little bit about the question of whether this second arrest might have been a pretext for a narcotics search.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.282" offset="1569855">And with the Court’s permission, I’ll come to that in the course of my exposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.441" offset="1598485">After he had determined that there had been revocation of Robinson’s regular operator's permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.386" offset="1630250">The next day after he made that determination in the traffic records, Officer Jenks saw Robinson again driving not far from here, on 8th and C Streets, North East and pulled the respondent over for -- in order to arrest him for the crime of driving after revocation of his temporary operator's permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.394" offset="1714364">Now the respondent got out of the car and walked toward the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.531" offset="1730873">The police officer then asked Robinson for his operator's permit, the temporary operator's permit, which he’d previously seen and upon receiving it informed Robinson that he was under arrest for driving after revocation of his regular operator's permit and for obtaining his temporary permit by misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.189" offset="1809554">Now at that point, as required by the standing orders of the Metropolitan Police Department, he proceeded to search Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.304" offset="1837976">In this case, they were standing face to face outside the automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.307" offset="1853962">And Officer Jenks placed his hands on the respondent’s chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.741" offset="1871726">His left hand -- his right hand on the respondent’s left breast and almost immediately, he felt an object inside the pocket of the car coat that Robinson was wearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.362" offset="1922194">He felt an object in the left breast pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.823" offset="1932016">Now the record shows that Officer Jenks didn’t know what that object was, he couldn’t tell its size or he couldn’t tell whether it was hard or whether it was soft.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.501" offset="1970782">Officer Jenks then reached into the pocket and pulled the package out.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.275" offset="1985829">The package was a crumpled up package of cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.906" offset="2000353">Officer Jenks at that point, the record shows knew that the package did not contain cigarettes because of its crumpled condition and he didn’t know what it did contain.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.081" offset="2041104">He opened it up and he found the heroin, which is the subject of this prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.981" offset="2064718">Now, in light of some of the questions asked in the previous argument, I think I should state that the record indicates that Officer Jenks was not in any imminent sense of danger to not feel in any imminent sense of danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.116" offset="2117172">He had a substantial weight advantage over the respondent and wasn’t in any particular fear in conducting this arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.149" offset="2149355">Nor did he have any specific purpose in mind when he conducted the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.826" offset="2168059">What he said was when asked I just searched him, I didn’t think about what I was looking for, I just searched him.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.619" offset="2195226">He did say that he recognized that the rules which required the search were designed for his own safety and were designed to uncover any weapons which might have been used to harm him.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.417" offset="2246426">Now, if I may mention one or two preliminary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.074" offset="2261055">First of all, unlike Gustafson, the Government here does not advance any evidentiary basis for this search.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.443" offset="2290521">We predicate the search entirely on the right to search for weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.997" offset="2308702">We believe that he had all the evidence he needed when he had the temporary operator's permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1058.371" offset="4310204">There was testimony from an Officer Donaldson, a police instructor, who testified that time is of the essence in conducting a custodial arrest.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="1583.152" offset="6409404">Yes he would have and if he couldn’t, he’d be subjected to all kinds of difficulties of a custodial obligations attaching to it and I’ve suggested that in the Peters case, the Court has suggested that that is a perfectly permissible practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.533" offset="6470844">Now, I’d like to point out one fact that is argue -- an argument which is made by the respondent’s counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.704" offset="6511595">Well, he argues that this expert’s evidence shows really the opposite of what we argued that it shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.024" offset="6540852">He argues that it shows that a pat down is adequate and I suggest that the confusion there arises from a confusion as to what a frisk really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.751" offset="6591739">And a search of the record indicates that in this case, Mr. Gartlan quoted some language from Terry to the police officer, excuse me, the weapons expert which involved a thorough search of the body and the groin and the testicles and it goes on to describe that search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.707" offset="6675540">Now the expert there testified that that was not a frisk and was not in his view of a frisk and I attempted to demonstrate in the brief that that language was never intended to be a definition of a frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.353" offset="6726113">And I think that if the Court reads the record with that in mind and with the fact in mind that the expert did testify that it would be required in order to conduct a really thorough search that the officer go into the pockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.222" offset="6777626">That it’s quite clear from the record that a Terry type frisk would be inadequate to reveal all the weapons that could be hidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.012" offset="6816810">Now, there is a second point that we raise in the brief relating to the question that if the Court finds that reaching into pocket did infringe Robinson’s Fourth Amendment rights, it would've been a minimal violation at most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.811" offset="6875951">And we suggest that the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule would not be well served by excluding evidence which is the result of a policeman’s protective search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.927" offset="6916493">But I don’t believe that I have to go into that at this point because I believe first of all, my time is about to expire and secondly, I believe that this search was thoroughly reasonable and that the conviction ought to be sustained on that ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.177" offset="7157447">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.461" offset="7178553">As we understand the government’s position in this case, it basically takes three themes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.201" offset="7205512">First of all, that there is nothing in the Terry case, the Sibron case or the Peters case which limits the scope of a post to rest search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.760" offset="7251801">And that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia confused two distinct sets of principles applicable to Fourth Amendment searches by disregarding the significance of a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.959" offset="7308539">The second theme of the Government’s argument is that the Metropolitan Police Departments of the District of Columbia, instruction to its police officers with respect to the extent of a search in this case, this type of case is a reasonable type of instruction and approach that a Terry type frisk is not adequate protection in the instance of a full custody arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.669" offset="7411461">And finally, the attack upon the exclusionary rule and the request that it'd be modified in cases of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.397" offset="7454302">It seems to us clear addressing myself to the first point that in Terry, this court rejected a notion advanced by the State of Ohio that the Fourth Amendment doesn’t even come into play as a limitation upon police conduct if the officer stopped short of something called a technical arrest or a full blown search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.580" offset="7555030">And this Court went further to say that the sounder course of analysis in Fourth Amendment cases is to recognize that the Fourth Amendment governs all intrusions by agents of the public upon personal security and to make the scope of a particular intrusion in the light of all of the exigencies of the case a central element in the analysis of reasonable arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.996" offset="7676761">Then in Peters we had a case wherefore the purposes of constitution analysis, an arrest had taken place when Officer Lasky apprehended Peters in the hallway of his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.880" offset="7732245">And this Court said with respect to the pat down type of search that was conducted by Officer Lasky that this was reasonably limited in its scope to its evidentiary and protective purposes and was not an unrestrained and thorough going examination of the arrestee and his personal effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.432" offset="7814478">Now the government has pointed out in this case, Mr. Justice Harlan’s observation of that language in the Terry decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.953" offset="7844571">Mr. Justice Harlan said, “That’s all it was, an observation” and that the Court was -- and in other words, the Court was not saying in Terry that a protective search incident to a lawful arrest is limited to a frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.010" offset="7904758">But this Court in Chimel shortly after Terry said as to its decision in Peters and I quote, “We sustain the search in Peters, however, only because its scope had been reasonably limited by the need to seize weapons and to prevent the destruction of evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.820" offset="7992007">We emphasized, again quoting from this Court’s decision that the arresting officer did not engage in an unrestrained and through going examination of Peters and his personal effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.441" offset="8038504">So it seems to me that in -- certainly in Peters, this case was -- this Court was taking the scope limitation principles applied truly enough in a different context in Terry and making an application of them in a new context, a post arrest situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.315" offset="8125962">And in Sibron, the third case in the trilogy, while there, the Court found that -- this Court found there was no probable cause for the arrest and that the circumstances were there for the equivalent of the stop and frisk situation confronting the officer in Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.532" offset="8194926">In its opinion, it assumed arguendo that would -- even though if the circumstances of apprehension and fear had been present in the Sibron case as they had been in Terry, thus making it for the purposes of protection of a police officer the equivalent of a post arrest situation, then the search into Sibron’s pockets was going too far.

            <text syncTime="2993.875" offset="12052271">The government urges that this search of Mr. Robinson was that at most a minimal violation of his rights, that it was neither willful nor flagrant and that the exclusionary rule justified as a deterrent to illegal searches and seizures as a demonstrable failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.800" offset="12147984">And considering the substantiality of this violation, this evidence even though illegally seized should be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.865" offset="12204199">I need not remind this Court of its constant and necessity for its constant vigilance with respect to intrusions on personal liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.385" offset="12242338">As long ago as 1886, it held in Boyd versus the United States, an illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes and procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.920" offset="12304405">It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizens and against any stealthy encroachments there off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.634" offset="12339304">If we are to be left to the good faith of police officers, this Court has already dealt with that situation because in Terry it said, “Simple good faith on the part of the -- of the arresting officer is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.449" offset="12390504">If subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate and the people would be secured in their persons, houses, papers and effects only in the discretion of the police.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.780" offset="12451840">I think that it can be fairly said that the government stretches a point when it says in its brief that what Mr. Justice Powell has described in the Schneckloth case as the most searching empirical study of the efficacy of the exclusionary rule when the government suggested it is a failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.879" offset="12536268">Professor Oaks, the author of that article does argue that it is a failure, but he says that the empirical data fall short of establishing that the rule does not discourage illegal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.979" offset="12592692">But deterrences by no means, the only justification for the rule. 60 years ago as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out in Weeks, this Court took care to define the issue in these Fourth Amendment cases this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.577" offset="12663014">The question is the right of a court in a criminal prosecution to retain for the purposes of evidence the papers of the accused seized in his house without his authority and without a warrant for his arrest and none for the search of his premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.735" offset="12739709">This Court then held in that case that if a trial court had such a right, the protection of the Fourth Amendment is of no value, it might as well be stricken from the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.407" offset="12790387">Six years later, Mr. Justice Holmes said if that would be the case, the Fourth Amendment would be reduced to a mere form of words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.488" offset="12826749">For almost 60 years, this Court has not departed from this essential core of Weekes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.834" offset="12852036">And over those decades, it has thundered to every court in the federal system and since 1961 to the states, you have no right, the courts, to obtain and you shall not keep and use against an accused the ill gotten gains of searches which violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.531" offset="12954854">This -- the Weekes' Court said, is one of those great principles established by years of endeavor and suffering and it must not be given up lightly even in a case where constitutional liberty and the violation of constitutional right are separated by the fabric line of a coat pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.179" offset="13057463">This Court has urged to analogize to those cases in which less than perfect Miranda warnings have not resulted in the exclusion of admissions or confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.577" offset="13111066">I respectfully submit that that analogy limps rather bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.296" offset="13125904">The Constitution does not require Miranda warnings, but it does require a warrant from a magistrate to permit a search unless the exigencies of the case demand otherwise, the exigency being an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.474" offset="13186612">The Fifth Amendment Right is not violated absent Miranda warnings until the incriminating statement is used in the trial against the defendant to making a witness against himself.</text>
