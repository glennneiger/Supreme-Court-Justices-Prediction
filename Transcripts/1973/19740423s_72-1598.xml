            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">In NLRB against Bell Aerospace, we have a labor law case here on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.027" offset="140852">The question presented, involved the appropriateness under the National Labor Relations Act of a collective bargaining unit composed of buyers, persons responsible for the purchasing function for respondent corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.039" offset="212950">Following an election and certification of the unit by the Board, the company refused to bargain, contending that the buyers were managerial employees and not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.382" offset="270315">The company was found guilty of an unfair labor practice and ordered to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.548" offset="294975">The Court of Appeals denied enforcement on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.556" offset="314932">First it held that the Board had applied an erroneous test in determining whether these employees were covered by the Act and secondly, in view of the Boardâ€™s previous contrary decisions, the Court held that the Board must proceed by rule making rather than adjudication before adopting a new test.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.749" offset="415765">The central issue is whether managerial employees are covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.914" offset="440424">The Board had previously indicated that they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.592" offset="463099">In this case however, the Board applied a more restrictive test of whether the employee's duties would create a conflict of interest in labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.224" offset="517642">We hold, as they did the Second Circuit, that such a restrictive test is not compatible with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.380" offset="550243">The appropriate question is whether the individual is a managerial employee and this depends not upon his title, but upon his authority and duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.357" offset="602175">We do not agree, however, that rule making is required on this issue rather than a case-by-case adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.238" offset="641672">Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.544" offset="670929">Mr. Justice White filed a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall joined.</text>
