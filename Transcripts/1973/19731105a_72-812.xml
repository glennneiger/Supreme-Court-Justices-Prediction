            <label>Mr. Joseph Remcho</label>
            <text syncTime="1007.691" offset="4107494">Oh, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.617" offset="4115226">We have thought at the time at any rate the irreparable injury to the -- there was no injury to the State but there would be injury to Storer in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.982" offset="4144692">I am addressing myself to the issue that independent candidates to get on the ballot may not have been a member of a political party for the preceding 17 months and may not have voted at the preceding primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.166" offset="4197460">In our view, that is qualifications by the California Legislature to those set forth in Article 1 Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.935" offset="4224522">In this Court, in Powell versus McCormack said that the National Legislature may not add to those qualifications of age, citizenship and inhabitancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.840" offset="4260153">As the National Legislature cannot and surely the State may not and in fact Appellees have conceded this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.125" offset="4289202">They argue however that person can be elected to Congress in two other ways besides meeting those additional qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.283" offset="4317832">That is they argue, he can be a party candidate or that it can succeed the ride-in -- on the ride-in at the -- in the California Election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.169" offset="4353463">These possibilities, really in our view constitute merely alternative qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.185" offset="4373525">To restate the California scheme, a person to become a member of Congress must either first, be a member of recognized political party, that is the party group; second, must not have been a member of the party with preceding 17 months and further have not had voted; that’s this independent group we are challenging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.313" offset="4446041">Or third, he must run as ride-in candidate with no chance to success in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.912" offset="4468402">I think the issue this Court want to address itself to is the viability of the ride-in as an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.158" offset="4497345">I think it can be viewed in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.031" offset="4504869">Either it’s that alternative qualification that a person must be so widely supported by people in California that he can gain election even when his supporters have to ride-in and the supporters of others by merely go down and check a mark on the voting machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.461" offset="4578638">Or secondly, we can say that the party group and independent group are the additional qualifications for the Congress and that the alternative which the State provides is really an unrealistic alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.772" offset="4627853">It is impossible alternative under current California procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.252" offset="4653767">The Appellees attempt I think to show that there is a ride-in alternative really shows quite the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.000" offset="4680725">The only example they can come up with is the case in which a person who is a Democratic incumbent and already on the ballot for the Democratic primary, won a Republican primary in by ride-in when no one was on a Republican ballot that is someone had to win by ride-in, there is no other way to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.503" offset="5686753">I think in this case, any ambiguity as to whether or not the ride-in is an effective alternative ought to be resolved in favor of the people’s right to elect the Congress those people whom they choose and not whom the California legislature chooses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.083" offset="5797094">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.334" offset="5810051">Our basic position is completely different of course than the Appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.525" offset="5826873">The Appellants have very studiously avoided this Court’s decision in Jenness versus Fortson and it is our position that we look to Jenness versus Fortson for the guidelines as to how California’s law and its constitutionality should be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.562" offset="5903047">It is clear when we look at California’s Law that California has preserved the fluidity of political life and has not frozen the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.599" offset="5955187">That was the key to Jenness versus Fortson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.991" offset="5968666">As alluded to by Appellants very rapidly as we -- in their argument, California has not two parties, but has four qualified parties presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.155" offset="6017358">Besides the Democratic and Republicans, we have the American Independent Party and the Peace and Freedom Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.833" offset="6040033">So obviously, we are not a Williams versus Rhodes situation where the political life of California has been a frozen for the Democrats and Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.207" offset="6093531">Also, there’s been little said about Section 6430 of the California Elections Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.094" offset="6129162">We feel that Section 6430 of Elections Code in and of itself without even reference to the independent nomination procedure satisfies all the constitutional rights of the Appellants and other electors in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.737" offset="6195722">Under said provisions as has been explained an old party can remain on the ballot if it gets 2% of the previous vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.362" offset="6246191">Secondly, if they have 1% registration as of 135 days before the election, they also become a qualified party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.764" offset="6283807">Additionally, they can become a qualified party by getting a petition with 10% of the number of voters at the last gubernatorial election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.286" offset="6337933">We also have the ride-in process in all elections: Primary, General, State and Local offices, Federal office and the Presidential Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.357" offset="6386207">So, we haven’t even gotten into the independent nomination procedure so obviously, if any group of electors wishes to organize and exercise their First Amendment rights under the provisions of Section 6430 of the Elections Code, they may do so as did the American Independent Party and the Peace and Freedom Party in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.015" offset="6492787">Also in the past, we have had other qualified parties as alluded to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.586" offset="6507102">We have had the -- in the 50’s we had -- and into the 60’s, the progressive, excuse me, the Prohibition Party was a qualified party and also for a while we had the, I believe was the progressive independent party in the 50’s.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.715" offset="6603651">Now the 1/15 is an additional qualification to stay on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.247" offset="6621727">There is a provision in Section 6430 that says “and if at any time that the registration falls within 1/15 of 1%, then they are automatically off no matter what they got the last time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.887" offset="6664255">Now, that’s interesting from the point of view that in Georgia -- in looking at Georgia’s 5% of the vote, last vote requirement, they could have had zero because they do not have that added qualification and the Court still upheld Georgia’s 5% requirement in Jenness versus Fortson.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.991" offset="7020669">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.572" offset="7027043">As I was saying before lunch, I was outlining how under the provisions of Section 6430 of the California Elections Code, the fluidity of political life is preserved without even reference to the independent nomination procedure which is solely attack in this particular lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.651" offset="7115337">Additionally of course, we have the ride-in process in all elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.219" offset="7137593">So therefore, we get to the question what scope of review should be used here and it is our position that in view of the fact that Section 6430 takes in addition and in conjunction with the ride-in process already preserves the constitutional rights of electors in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.321" offset="7250024">That the independent nomination procedure really essentially has its existence or now has very little impact upon the voters in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.950" offset="7296522">Therefore, under the test set forth by this Court in Bullock versus Carter, the rational basis test should be used in examining its provisions instead of the close scrutiny test and in this regard it would seem that we are essentially talking about a case which involves barriers to candidacy as opposed to the right to vote per se as found in such cases is Carrington versus Rash and the Kramer case, the Cipriano case and so forth which were direct infringements upon and that direct disenfranchisements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.347" offset="7494113">However, despite the fact that we feel that only the rational basis test need be used, we feel that even should we examine the California Independent nomination procedure in a vacuum so to speak that each of its substantive provisions are necessary to further compelling state interests of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.263" offset="7601842">Now taking these elements individually, we first of all have the 5% signature requirement of Section 6831.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.652" offset="7643324">Well, of course, this Court has recognized unqualifiedly that in Jenness versus Fortson that a significant modicum of support is proper to prevent proliferation of the ballot and to also prevent confusion, deception and even frustration of our electoral system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.430" offset="7770488">Three-judge District Courts have elevated this in itself to a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.988" offset="7808731">For example, Beniger versus Ogilvie which is cited in our brief and the Beller versus Kirk which was affirmed sub nom Beller versus Askew by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.891" offset="7860349">In fact, when you examine California’s 5% requirement vis-à-vis Georgia’s 5% requirements, you will find that California’s 5% requirement is really about a 3-1/2% requirement, because Georgia uses a different test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.241" offset="7921685">Georgia used a test of all of the electors who were qualified to vote at the last election whereas California uses the test all those people who actually voted for that office then using the 70% test that the Appellant’s use all the time, that would come out to about a 3-1/2% requirement on Georgia’s scale instead of a 5% requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.148" offset="8037355">Additionally, we point out that Appellants apparently do not seriously even contest the 5% requirement in and of itself and we presume the difficult for them to do because of Jenness versus Fortson and cases as such as -- excuse me, not Beniger versus Ogilvie, it was Jackson versus Ogilvie and Beller versus Kirk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.706" offset="8159608">Now, moving on to the 6830 (c) of the California Elections Code wherein it restricts the signatories to those who have not voted at the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.561" offset="8214988">Now, there was much of discussion as to what is a primary election in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.013" offset="8236826">Now our position below at the District Court level was that in California, the primary election held in June is in reality, a series of primary elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.996" offset="8288758">It’s essentially a consolidation of a group of primary elections, one for each parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.522" offset="8310805">Therefore in 1972, we would have had a primary election for four parties and a separate primary election, basically for “declines to state.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.496" offset="12022700">Now, they are part of our package in California which ensures at the primary stage that the party rating does not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.126" offset="12077244">There is a similar one year provision as to candidates changing between parties in Section 6401 and if you add that up, it turns out to be more than a 17-month provision for them to switch parties and run in another party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.347" offset="12150178">And that is -- and so by a parity of reasoning, we are not arguing that these provisions are to prevent party rating, but they are analogous there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.928" offset="12212454">We feel that these party rating statutes are, for example, in Lippitt versus Cipollone, there was a four-year restriction as to a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.070" offset="12265012">Well, that is basically an objective test and what we are saying here is we have basically a one-year objective test to show that the person is truly an independent and isn't striking off on his own as a disgruntled member of a party to splinter the party at the general election stage, or you could have the whole series of people striking out on their own and the party system would just disintegrated if that were permitted and the cases such as those who relied upon by the Appellants are not point because they -- such as Yale versus Curve and they were cases involving restrictions as to voters.</text>
