            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="9.866" offset="116193">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.264" offset="137822">The respondent who was a defendant arrested and indicted for rape was interrogated prior to this Court's decision Miranda versus Arizona by police officers who advised him of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel, but did not advise him of his right to appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.140" offset="213264">Respondent told the police that he understood his right and that he did not desire a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.884" offset="236251">In response to questioning he then offered the name of one Henderson as an alibi witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.863" offset="260180">The police contacted Henderson who did not provide respondent with an alibi, but indeed quite the contrary gave the police incriminating information about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.152" offset="305319">Respondent saw just depressed both his own statements and Henderson's testimony at his trial which occurred after the Miranda decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.637" offset="343249">The trial court excluded respondent's statements, but the motion to exclude Henderson's testimony was denied and Henderson was allowed to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.088" offset="381074">Respondent was convicted and his conviction was affirmed throughout the Michigan appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.625" offset="407197">He then sought habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan which granted the writ, holding the Henderson's testimony was inadmissible because his identity had been learned only through respondent's statement given without the full scope of the warning set forth in Miranda and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.343" offset="498103">We reverse the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.171" offset="509388">The police in this case did not deny respondent any right guaranteed by the constitution, but rather failed only to give him the full Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.788" offset="547944">Under these circumstances and because the interrogation occurred prior to this Court's decision in Miranda, we do not believe that the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule would be served by excluding Henderson's testimony as well as respondent's own statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.184" offset="613460">There is no concern in this case with the evidence derived from respondent's -- no concern that such evidence is in anyway untrustworthy as a result of respondent's failure to receive full warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.792" offset="659958">To the extent of the exclusionary rule maybe justified on the basis of requiring the government to bear a full burden of investigation, we do not believe that the limited recourse to respondent's statement which is involved in this case violates any provision of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.135" offset="721293">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.452" offset="734563">Mr. Justice Stewart while joining the opinion of the Court has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.295" offset="753894">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.581" offset="779076">Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.361" offset="794227">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
