            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="56.001" offset="300722">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.737" offset="311693">These cases are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.723" offset="331651">They concern the validity of certain orders of the Federal Power Commission, adopting a new method of regulating the sales of natural gas producers -- sales by natural -- a class of natural -- small natural gas producers in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.287" offset="389851">Following my argument on behalf of the Commission, Mr. Vaughan will argue on behalf of the other petitioners for approximately five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.135" offset="417332">They are among the class of small producers that are affected by the Commission’s orders in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.904" offset="448366">It is now almost universally recognized that we are experiencing an increasingly critical shortage of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.442" offset="474488">The orders at issue in this case are part of the Federal Power Commission’s vigorous program for combating that shortage by encouraging new exploration and development of the natural gas reserves in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.556" offset="526942">The orders rest on the Commission’s authority under Section 16 of the Natural Gas Act which gives it the authority to classify persons within its jurisdiction and to prescribe different requirements for different classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.212" offset="577620">The class involved here is not a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.665" offset="587442">The Commission has previously given specialized rate treatment to this group of small producers and this Court held in the Permian Basin case that “the problems in public functions of small producers differ sufficiently to permit their separate classification.”</text>
            <text syncTime="145.054" offset="656927">Those problems in public functions were described in some detail in the Permian opinion and the facts are the same today.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.310" offset="689946">Small producers account for only about 10% to 15% of the gas that’s transported in interstate pipelines and their prices generally follow the prices that large producers are able to get for their gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.166" offset="745430">But while they contribute only a small portion of the interstate gas, they have traditionally been responsible for about 80% of the exploratory drilling, much of it in the areas that have not previously been explored which makes it a highly risky operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.271" offset="805825">The result is as this Court stated in Permian and I quote again, “Their contribution to the search for new gas reserves is significant, but it is made at correspondingly greater financial risks and at higher unit costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.248" offset="861727">The principle impediment to the small producers’ exploratory efforts has been a lack of adequate financing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="202.865" offset="888163">The comments submitted to the Commission in this proceeding for example at page 84 of the appendix suggest that small producers must rely principally on revenues from current sales in order to finance their exploratory activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.420" offset="942393">That is so because the hazards of their exploration are such that it makes it difficult to depend upon debt financing and because the small producers unlike the large producers seldom have other operations to generate funds that they can use for exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.208" offset="1009580">Given this situation, the Commission devised in this rulemaking proceeding, a new regulatory program designed to take advantage of the small producers’ unique situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.670" offset="1055451">I want to emphasize that that this Court has before it only the orders that would setup a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.081" offset="1077081">It is not reviewing any order applying this program to the facts of any particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.019" offset="1100800">The court’s review consequently is a limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.918" offset="1112398">The only question is whether the Act prohibits the Commission from experimenting along the lines that it has chosen to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.099" offset="1137162">And this Court has stated on a number of occasions that one which challenges the validity of orders of the Federal Power Commission bears a heavy burden of showing that it will lead unjust and unreasonable results.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.889" offset="1188258">The Power Commission’s plan has these features.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.673" offset="1203409">First, instead of following the ordinary procedure of having each new sale of natural gas certificated in the public conven -- as in the public convenience and necessity, small producers are granted a blanket certificate which covers all sales up to a stated maximum annual volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.798" offset="1267984">This particular feature is not a new one either.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.282" offset="1281881">A similar blanket certificate procedure was established as part of the Permian proceeding and was approved by the Court in principal in that case. Second, the small producer acting under this blanket certificate may sell gas at whatever contract price he is able to negotiate even if it is higher than the area wide maximum rates that have been established by the Commission as just and reasonable for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.291" offset="1377907">Now this aspect of the order is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.977" offset="1388669">The prior blanket certificate procedure -- permitted sales at rates up to area maximum, but not higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.815" offset="1416046">The purpose in this order was to give some play to market forces to see whether prices would in fact exceed the area maximums and if so whether they would make it more attractive and more feasible for the small producers to engage in the kind of exploratory drilling that been its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.176" offset="1493473">A third feature of the order is that in order to permit the small producer to rely on his current revenues and planning his exploratory program, the rates that are collected under the contracts are not subject to refund, even if the Commission later determines that the rates were un -- were higher than the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.945" offset="1572571">Now this is in effect is an advanced determination by the Commission that it will serve the public interest to announce that it will not suspend and make subject to refund the new rates filed by -- new rates in the new small producer contracts, but rather will limit itself to acting prospectively under Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to reduce any rate that it concludes is unreasonably high.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.332" offset="1690122">Under the Commission’s plan, its review of the reasonableness of the small producers' rates will take place not in a producer proceeding, but rather subsequently in a pipeline proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.893" offset="1732336">Under the plan, the pipelines are authorized to track the increased rates resulting from the new small producer contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.658" offset="1767340">The tracking proceeding in which the pipelines seeks to pass on the increased rates to its customers is the one in which the Commission will determine the reasonableness of the underlying small producer rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.960" offset="1816555">The pipeline is required under the orders to show that its operating expenses, all of its operating expenses, in this case particularly its, purchased gas costs are not unreasonably high.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="446.869" offset="1864202">well, I gather Mr. Evans, if in the pipeline proceeding it's determined that the producer rates are too high, there's no requirement that the small producers’ refund, (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="457.559" offset="1906939">That’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.009" offset="1908820">There's no -- there is no requirement that the small producer refund to the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.804" offset="1923971">On the other hand, if the determination is made that the rates are unreasonably high, the pipeline is not permitted to pass on those increased rates to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.374" offset="1958243">This serves as a bond or protection for the ultimate consumer who thereby avoids having to bear the brunt of any unreasonably high rates.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="479.757" stopTime="481.738">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="479.757" offset="1995755">Judge Fay disagreed with that didn’t he?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_evans" startTime="481.738" stopTime="616.865">
            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="481.738" offset="2003696">Well Judge Fay, he concluded that it would be appropriate to strike the no refund aspects of the -- of this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.775" offset="2031804">But really, that would destroy the heart of the program because, the ref -- the no refund assurance to the small producer is what the Commission is hoping will give him a sense of security in his current revenues that will permit him to make the planning that’s necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.118" offset="2089169">At the same time it has the very important function of giving an incentive to the pipeline to bargain the prices down.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.483" offset="2118635">What the Commission has done is -- has freed the small producers and the pipelines to negotiate rates higher than the area maximum, but they wanted to leave some bite to the market forces that would otherwise be -- would be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.826" offset="2164088">And if the pipeline is sure that it could it always either pass on its rates that are increased or get refunds if they’re ultimately determined to be unreasonably high, it has a free passage and it needn’t be terribly concerned about the rates barring, you know, the ultimate consumer, if it’s running into problems with other forms of energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.537" offset="2234932">Of course there are of different problems if they're on the line, but ordinarily he’s not going to be in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.756" offset="2251755">So, the no refund assurance is really at the very heart of this program and without it I don’t think the program has it all the -- the meat that the Commission it intended to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.108" offset="2297208">Well, the result of the features as I’ve described them is that the small producer is assured that his current revenues are not subject to refunds so that he can rely on them in making his plans for exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.746" offset="2343706">The pipeline which faces this risk of absorbing the losses if it enters into contracts, they’re unreasonably high, has an incentive to bargain the prices down.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.312" offset="2381949">And finally, the consumer whose protection, the Act is principally designed, to assure is fully protected because there is no -- because no unreasonably high small producer rates will be permitted to be passed on by the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.261" offset="2433776">Now, the plan is without doubt an experimental one and the Commission intends to monitor closely the results under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.427" offset="2466482">In particular, it stated at page 145 of the appendix that if it finds the program as adverse, the -- affecting the interest of consumers, it will take appropriate corrective action.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.542" offset="2518936">The Commission’s plan is attacked in a variety of grounds, but they can properly redo -- be reduced I think to three.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.436" offset="2638472">They’re defined to include producers whose annual sales in interstate commerce are below the level of 10,000,000 Mcf, that is thousand cubic feet of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.696" offset="2711510">The first argument that’s made against the validity of the Commission’s order is that it abandons the statutory standard of just and reasonable rates and this is the basis upon which the Court of Appeals relied in setting aside the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.616" offset="2771174">The second argument is that the Act does not permit rate review in this indirect manner that is postponing the review until the pipeline proceeding; and finally, its claim that the plan is unfair to the large producers and pipelines who purchase gas from small producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.875" offset="2852258">The Commission’s order specified that its review of the small producer, the reasonableness of small producer’s rates in the pipeline proceedings would be in accordance with this -- with a standard that I think it might be worth looking at closely, it appears at page 142 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.419" offset="2938462">It stated there slightly below the middle of the page that the standard will be whether or not the small producers’ rate, that is the increase that the pipeline seeks to pass on, is unreasonably high considering appropriate comparisons with highest contract prices for sales by large producers or the prevailing market price for intrastate sales in the same producing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.090" offset="3049117">The Court of Appeals thought this was a departure from the statutory just and reasonable standard because it erroneously assumed that the Commission was tying its reasonableness determination exclusively to the two market factors that the order mentioned, namely, the highest contract prices and the prevailing intrastate rates, neither of which of course the Commission regulates.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.637" offset="3131246">This reliance upon this reading of the order is made clear by the Court of Appeals at page 12 (a) of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.649" offset="3167295">We don’t take the position here that an order tying reasonableness to those factors would never be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.234" offset="3189656">In fact this Court in Permian suggested that in proper circumstances, it might be appropriate, but we do say this is not what the Commission did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.734" offset="3223719">The order does not suggest that the two factors that the Commission identified would be the only ones that will be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.347" offset="3254126">The standard is one of unreason -- whether the rate is unreasonably high and the Commission emphasized that it would consider all relevant factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.267" offset="3653799">It seems to reasonably clear that while prevailing market prices are unquestionably among the factors that it be -- are to be taken into account, the Commission has not indicated that it is the only considerations that would be taken into account and for that reason it's not -- the standard is not an abandonment of the statutory just and reasonable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.672" offset="3747422">The second issue is whether there is anything in the Act to prohibit the kind of indirect regulatory scheme that the Commission adopted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.807" offset="3780023">The respondents argue that the Act requires direct review in a pipeline proceeding, but they have pointed to nothing in the Act that so specifies and this Court has repeatedly held in Power Commission cases that under the just and reasonable standard, it is the result that matters and not the regulatory method that’s used.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.505" offset="3854733">Since this scheme in our view is reasonably designed to result in just and reasonable rates, it does not matter that the indirect method is the one that is used and it does not matter that the Commission has departed from its prior practice of viewing these matters in direct proceedings in producer proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.251" offset="3917740">In fact this Court in the Sunray DX case 391 U.S. upheld a similar indirect regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.373" offset="3950237">The issue there was whether the Commission was required under the Act to consider in a producer certificate proceeding whether there was a public need for the gas contracted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.887" offset="3988271">The Court upheld the Commission’s determination that the question could more appropriately be considered in the pipeline proceeding and the Court held that the Act requires no more than that there’d be an adequate forum in which the issue is to be ventilated and that the pipeline proceeding was an adequate form in which to ventilate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.660" offset="4059429">Finally the pipelines argue that the Commission’s plan will be unfair to them because it will impose upon them what they refer to as no burdens and due risks and because the reasonableness standard articulated in the order in their view is to vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.906" offset="4116376">The fact is, however, that the pipelines have always borne the risk that an operating expanse will be deemed by the Commission to be unreasonably high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.687" offset="4147513">In the past, the Commission has not required special justification of purchased gas costs because it was clear at that point that the cost were reasonable, the Commission having already made that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.977" offset="4188682">But there is no reason to think that the pipeline has by virtue of this practice and tradition become insulated to closer scrutiny of those purchased gas costs where their reasonableness has not been determined in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.737" offset="4235703">The Commission here has not invented a new burden or risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.018" offset="4244793">It has simply highlighted an existing one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.391" offset="5926348">Well, Your Honor it -- for one, I think two basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.418" offset="5946410">One is that the large producers tend to hunt for big game and another phenomenon, that transpires in the industry is that the geophysical techniques, the science of oil exploration does not yield and has not yielded an increased success ratio in the -- over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.217" offset="6073574">They’re finding the same number of wells per -- same number of productive wells per wells drill now that they were in the 20’s and the large producer says, “Small producer, you go out and drill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.155" offset="6177332">The second class of gas of course is your flowing gas and they -- the contract prices now prevail for flowing gas for small producers, but if we look at how much of the contract prices will exceed, the directly regulated just in area rates, we will see that there is only about 25% of the contract provisions which permit the gas, the small producers, indeed the gas of all producers, according to the study, gas of all producers to exceed the just and reasonable area rate and it is this increment, this 25% increment of the small producer -- production or approximately 3% of the total gas upon which the small producer must rely to finance his exploratory efforts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.849" offset="6460186">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.496" offset="6470740">I -- I’m representing the Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Association of America which includes in its membership virtually all the major pipelines in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.894" offset="6516297">I’m also arguing for the major producers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.405" offset="6530403">Mr. Schiff who is the general counsel in New York Public Service Commission will follow me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.640" offset="6551301">We have a rather unusual situation here and this maybe a first, a first time in my memory that the three segments of the industry are unified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.734" offset="6595709">We find the pipelines, we find the major producers, we find the consumers represented by Mr. Schiff, all unified in their attack against Order 428 issued by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.834" offset="6648059">Now, I would like to make one point very clear in the -- at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.740" offset="6667703">No one of us is opposed to giving the small producer a higher rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.565" offset="6694975">We think that based upon a proper record that the Federal Power Commission may well justify a higher rate which is just unreasonable for the small producer under the circumstances, but such is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.968" offset="6748578">There is no record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.257" offset="6757773">There are few comments in the transcript of an informal conference and that’s all we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.895" offset="6784313">Now, our friends here in the Government have told us in their reply brief that the issue is not whether the FPC can exempt the small producer from the Natural Gas Act and they say that the Commission hasn’t claimed this authority and they say they don’t argue that the statute permits it and they say that the contention of the Act requires all producer rates to be just and reasonable is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.156" offset="6897371">Now, the real issue as we see it is the exemption of the small producer and the how -- no matter how you twist or turn it, that is exactly what the Commission did in Order 428 and in its notice, the original notice issued in the rulemaking proceeding, it was frankly captioned, “Exemption of small producers in regulation” at joint appendix 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.054" offset="6992980">The notice also stated that the small producers would be exempt from all the provisions of the Natural Gas Act and Regulations other than an annual report on volumes and sale and this in the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.037" offset="7048882">So let's go with the Order and in the Order, the Commission told the small producers, “We seek to assure the small producers that when he enters into a new contract for the interstate sale of gas, the provisions of his contract will not, will not be subject to change” joint appendix 137.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.118" offset="7137176">Now we think that these, taken together, clearly indicate that the Commission contemplated an exemption and indeed the Court of Appeals wasn’t mislead on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.583" offset="7183047">But in the exemption, the counterpart of the exemption in order to give some camouflage to some sort of regulation, what they did was to shift the regulatory responsibility from the Federal Power Commission to the pipelines and large producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.438" offset="7250547">And this at a time when the pressures are on us as purchasers to pay the market price, they are asking us to substitute our regulation for theirs under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.430" offset="7306449">As mentioned the two standards in 428 were given as the highest contract price by large producers or the prevailing market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.453" offset="7342602">Now, we had some problems in the vagueness of these two terms, but much less than we have as a result of the reply brief filed by our friends here and I’ll get to that a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.324" offset="7378024">Now, as to the large producers, they had a third standard and they had have a market differential that was prevailing in the area, but the purpose of Order 428 was absolutely obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.405" offset="7422328">It was to give the small producers a price in excess of the just and reasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.528" offset="7442808">Otherwise there was absolutely no purpose in the Commission issuing Order 428.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.034" offset="7464856">It’s clear that this is what they had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.545" offset="7478962">And in so doing, and giving these standards, they gave the pipelines what we thought was somewhat of an assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.536" offset="7502890">They said, “The standards, these two standards, the standards also provide pipelines with a more concrete guide for their future actions than what exists in the absence thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.990" offset="7548656">Simply put the Commission wanted the pipelines to know in advance the boundaries within which they could freely contract the small producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.491" offset="7590661">As I’ve indicated, we think that that is -- the Order 428 adds up to complete exemption for the small producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.751" offset="7627755">We think that it’s in absolute contravention of the clear and unequivocal terms in the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Act says, Section 4 says, “All rates shall be just and reasonable and any rate that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.046" offset="7704973">Section 4 (d) says, “No natural gas company, and there is no argument that a sale by a small producer here involved in interstate commerce for resale is a natural gas company within the meaning of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.126" offset="7753247">Section 4 (b) says, “No natural gas company shall make any claim, undue preference or maintain any unreasonable difference in rates.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.239" offset="7785744">Section 4(c) says, “Every natural gas company shall file with the Commission, schedule showing all rates for any transportation and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.980" offset="7824718">Section 5 is likewise clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.940" offset="7832555">It says, “Whenever the Commission shall find any rate charged by any natural gas company is unjust, the Commission shall fix the rate as the just and reasonable rate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.251" offset="7877799">Now, the Commission in Order 428, and that’s what we’re dealing with here relied for its exemption, relied on the fact that Sections 4, 5, and 7 which is a certificate provision, are not mandatory, but discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.914" offset="7944359">This is what they said in the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.153" offset="7953345">They’re not arguing that now before this Court, but this is what they said in the Order, that it’s not mandatory and they’ve cited Mr. Justice Clark’s comments in FPC v. Hunt and also the Permian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.180" offset="8009456">Now, Mr. Justice Clark’s statement was pure dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.743" offset="8023771">He was talking about NLRB Act which allowed the Natural Labor Relations Board to decide whether or not it would exempt certain types of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.010" offset="8064836">There’s no such similar provisions than the Natural Gas Act and in the Permian case, the Permian case has no precedent for what the Commission purported to do in 428.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.378" offset="8106214">In the Permian case, the Commission had taken small producers, classified them separately, issued a blanket certificate and said, “As long as you do not exceed the 10 billion cubic feet a year, you don’t need any further certificate authorization for your sales in interstate commerce as long as and only under the condition that your rate to the pipeline purchaser does not exceed the just and reasonable rate and that’s precisely what the Permian case says were and has no basis at all for the Commission’s exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.239" offset="8905665">But notwithstanding this, they have suggested that one of the things that we do is ask the producer for his cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2300.267" offset="9277858">On the notice there was clear language that the pipelines would be able to pickup any increase or any price paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.307" offset="9353927">And at this point there was no change in the producer price at all, prospective or otherwise, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.252" offset="9381721">The first time we came across a reduction in producer price was before the Court of Appeals in the briefs filed by the Government, in their briefs in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.540" offset="9422890">But at that time they were still adhering to the fact that the provisions of the Natural Gas Act were discretionary and that they were recognizing in fact that they were exempting the small producer, but within the purview of their powers under Section 16 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.305" offset="9489972">But now, before you, they’ve abandoned all that and they now say, “That’s all beside the point, that’s all beside the point.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.569" offset="9563011">And the indirect regulation is nothing more than Sunray DX.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.667" offset="9579416">Sunray DX had to do with the need for gas, not rates, which is the heart of the Act as found by this Court in the famous Hope case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.204" offset="9617554">The heart of the regulatory scheme is the rate section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.196" offset="9629571">But what they’re talking about is the certificate case, where the need for the gas, do you determine that in the pipeline case or do you determine it in the producer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.280" offset="9669904">I think that’s a totally different case than the one we have here as to the direct rate responsibility being shifted to the pipelines when the clear responsibility is vested in the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.980" offset="9724656">We think all of this is contrary to the rule of the Chenery case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.174" offset="10501433">New York’s basic concern in this case is that the Commission’s action which we believe amounts to deregulation of small producer rates will result in passing on excessive cost to consumers and inevitably so under just about any construction of the Commission’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.753" offset="10595788">But I think it’s quite clear that even if one accepts the possibility of indirect regulation through the use of the pipeline proceeding, that the Commission’s order don’t provide for a determination of a just and reasonable rate and notwithstanding your question Mr. Justice White as to looking at the Order the way they’re now interpreting it, I would at least for the time being, in my limited time try to say what the Commission’s orders in fact said and the Court of Appeals construed it quite correctly, I don’t think any amount of rewriting can really change it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter H. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="2717.509" offset="10946769">Well, let me answer those in terms because if you would turn to page 142 of the joint appendix which is the Commission’s Order 428 which is under review, the Commission set a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.285" offset="11025868">The Commission determined that in order to encourage the small producers to receive more money and that the pipelines would contract the above what had been fixed to the just and reasonable rate for the large producers that it was necessary to provide the pipelines with some assurance of certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.559" offset="11127014">They established the standard which Mr. Evans has read to you saying that the pipelines will be subject to refund, a reduction and refund with respect to new small producer sales, but only as to that part of the rate which is unreasonably high considering appropriate comparisons with the highest contract prices for sales by large producers or the prevailing market price for intrastate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.647" offset="11239340">Now the next sentence is what I want to concentrate on says, “Tracking increases to the extent they reflect small producer prices for new sales above the standards set forth above may be suspended and if so will be collected subject to refund.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.702" offset="11307572">Now, two sentences later, the Commission says, “Where there has been a suspension,” now, remember this is only where it is above the standard, then the Commission shall consider all relevant factors and we don’t deny that the Commission may consider the relevant factors mentioned in the footnote 3 of the Government’s reply brief, but that only comes into play as the court below, I think recognized, is when the rates are -- that have been paid or above the standard fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.449" offset="11438498">Now the standard fixed is an in -- is the highest prices paid by -- to a large producer, contract price, I misspoke because it’s very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.370" offset="11490220">Traditionally the way the contracting has been done under the Natural Gas Act at least since Phillips in 1954, pipelines, pay or contract at higher prices than the Commission actually allows, certainly that’s been true since there had been real regulation by the Federal Power Commission and what is dishonorable as we point out in our brief from the files of the Federal Power Commission is that there are -- the contract price maybe 20, 30, or even 40 cents above the rate that has been determined just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.536" offset="11654896">Now, it is this high price which I suppose can be a market standard, but it’s an artificial market standard at that which the Commission says, “Anything up to that, we will allow without tracking, without going through it all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.152" offset="11717381">And that is what the Commission’s Order does in this thing and I don’t see how the Government can say that they have now rewritten it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.101" offset="11749146">They just don’t understand their own order or at least they don’t accept the impact of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.998" offset="11776731">Now the Court -- the courts have traditionally said that the reason for regulation of sales by producers whether they -- it is direct or indirect is because the market is not an adequate basis for determining the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.862" offset="11852173">At least where gas is in short supply and it’s a sellers’ market and we most assuredly have the biggest sellers’ market that there has been since the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.461" offset="11898567">And Permian is -- which the Government promised and sought a conflict with -- in their petition, is not inconsistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.477" offset="11938691">It’s conceivable that there are times when the market may be such that there is buyers’ market that competition will in fact produce a just and reasonable rate or indeed as in Permian, the Commission did look to market prices to look at how to balance rates between different types of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.053" offset="12020924">But there is no suggestion that the unregulated market price could be a just and reasonable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.792" offset="12051958">Now, there's another problem with this Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.406" offset="12074423">The Commission in dealing with the pipelines or in both 428 and 428 (b), the Commission said, “We have always been able to examine the cost of purchase -- gas in a pipeline proceeding and the cost of other expenses” and the Commission’s order expressly, if I may for a second, at page 139 said, “The Commission has ample authority to inquire in these cases, into the reasonableness of all operating expenses and to disallow items of costs which are imprudent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.970" offset="12268669">Now, this is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.999" offset="12280790">Of course it’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.573" offset="12291030">Imprudent expenses can be disallowed and they sometimes are termed as excessive or not reasonable from the point of view of the purchaser, but that is not the same as looking at it from the point view of the seller as to whether a seller’s rate is just and reasonable which is essentially related to costs, at least it’s a surrogate for cost whether it has to be based expressly on cost or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.483" offset="12414642">On the other hand, the prudency reasonable test is a market test, the very test which is not permissible as a basis for regulation under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.310" offset="12461976">Now, this is no different than when a pipeline purchases steel pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.528" offset="12494890">The pipeline can’t determine what the costs are of U.S. Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.914" offset="12516415">The question of whether its prudent or not is the matter of whether the pipeline has exercised reasonable contracting practices and has paid -- hasn’t just gone out to the layman, paid much more than it had to under market conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.307" offset="12589976">Now, I know of no authority and this is where I want to get to Mr. Justice White’s question, Mr. Boland, I know of no authority under which the FPC could disallow the cost based on a -- anything other purchased gas expenses in a pipeline proceeding on other -- anything other than the prudency test or reasonableness from the point of view of the buyer test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.750" offset="12711706">The only exception that I know of in regulatory annals is where there is an affiliation question where the seller buys from its affiliate, then you can get the cost but otherwise it’s a market test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.078" offset="12769071">And so that the Commission has to rewrite its Order not only in the first where that we discussed, but also has to rewrite the Order on what prudency means and it has no legal authority to do that and this is where the consumer will bear the brunt because the test isn’t the same test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.574" offset="12851096">Now, finally --</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.958" offset="12856529">If the Commission’s Order says, the Act I take it here in our view does not constitute the regulations in by small producers who will continue to regulate such sales, to produce at the pipeline level by reviewing the purchased gas cost of each pipeline is purchasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.204" offset="12917551">Now, is that just inconsistent with what they said elsewhere in the order?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter H. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="3216.729" offset="12943673">Well, the regulation that they are promising is a regulation of the purchases and the standard that they are setting is a market standard which is not the proper standard for what is a just and reasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.104" offset="13005113">And the prudency test is not a proper test and it’s the only legal test for determining what is a just and reasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.786" offset="13039909">So, they are saying they’re regulating, but the practical effect is that the nature of the regulation is precisely the kind of regulation that did exist before this court’s decision in Phillips in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.703" offset="13091527">It doesn’t change one iota, notwithstanding my friends’ comments in their reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.077" offset="13113051">That -- that was not considered regulation under the Natural Gas Act so that -- I think that’s my answer to you and that very basic to it though is that there just is no authority, whether it is -- when our Commission, the New York Commission regulates a distribution company or the Federal Power Commission relate -- regulates a pipeline company, there's no basis on which we can disallow costs simply because they exceed what the just and reasonable level would have been for the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.352" offset="13274175">It’s a prudency test and that’s all the authority that a regulatory Commission has and the FPC can change it by saying it has some other authority and it’s free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.515" offset="13318792">The Commission’s order is much more careful as to its authority in this respect I would say --</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter H. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="3337.006" offset="13424744">Well, I certainly do not suggest you go the whole way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.350" offset="13434149">I suggest that if you did that here, you do it with respect to all of producer regulation and I suggest that -- after 18, 19 years that this is a decision to be made in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.783" offset="13483886">There has been various Bills proposed in Congress for deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.603" offset="13499141">That, Your Honors, is a proper forum for the attempt to deregulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.129" offset="13517218">Now, I think this is what the Commission is doing, but this isn’t the right forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.491" offset="13542713">I want to say with respect to existing contracts that the Commission did not even make a pretense at indirect regulation, under existing contracts which my have been below the contract price, the just and reasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.413" offset="13630380">They let them go off, let them be passed through, no indirect regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.289" offset="13645949">I suggest that contrary to what it said in the reply brief of the Government that we properly raise that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.642" offset="13667265">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="3409.066" offset="13713032">Let me respond first to the question that -- what the Commission has been doing in the interim since the Court of Appeals decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.788" offset="13747931">Prior to the decision in the Court of Appeals, the Commission had been issuing certificates under the Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.870" offset="13772278">When the Court of Appeals set aside the order, the Commission ceased issuing permanent certificates under the order and begun issuing what they called temporary certificates which in effect leave the matter entirely open, pending ultimate disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.210" offset="13833613">The -- they are -- the certificates that have been issued since the Court of Appeals ruling have a condition -- had a condition that the producer will be subject to refund if the court, if this Court ultimately determines that the Court of Appeals was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.142" offset="13889306">Along the same lines, it’s very difficult to -- for me understand the argument that we have had three years to experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.458" offset="13922534">These three years have been years of obvious uncertainty which is exactly what the order is designed to eliminate until judicial review is at the end there is no fair basis for judging whether the Order will have the intended effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.347" offset="13986168">Mr. Schiff has emphasized to some degree that the market is -- the market prices are not the proper test for just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.419" offset="14022426">We don’t say that that’s the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.339" offset="14034129">We don’t argue that the Commission has used it, but I might point out that this Court in the Sunray DX case said that the true market price is the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.723" offset="14075611">The problem with the natural gas industry is that pipelines have traditionally been permitted to pass on their purchased gas costs in the form of increased rates and as a consequence there has been no incentive for the pipeline to bargain the prices down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.443" offset="14126498">Well, the purpose of the Commission’s order among other things is to give some sense of reality to the market here and make it more of a genuine market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.586" offset="14159099">So to that extent we have -- we contemplate -- the Commission contemplates something approaching, a true market price which would be the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.030" offset="14192849">And I might add also that this Court in Permian made it quite plain that it was permissible for the Commission to take into account market factors in determining the just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.370" offset="14238198">Finally, there seems to be a suggestion to Mr. Schiff’s argument that the standard of prudence is something that inheres in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.885" offset="14276336">There is no constitutional requirement that the Commission apply a prudent standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.026" offset="14292846">The constitutional limit is one of confiscation, that’s all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.932" offset="14316460">The statutory standard is what matters here and that standard is just and reasonable and that is the standard that the Commission intends to apply when it reviews the small producers’ rates at the pipeline level.</text>
