            <text syncTime="40.666" offset="239386">I would like to briefly summarize the facts of this case and describe to the Court how the case got here in a very brief fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.804" offset="268016">And then to discuss the constitutionality of the statute to which you discussed and then to discuss the intervention question of propriety or federal intervention -- federal court intervention in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.050" offset="324963">In about June of 1966, intensive efforts begin by the AFL-CIO in Texas to organize and unionize for the farmworkers in the Rio Grande Valley of Southern Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.305" offset="385985">Those efforts were marked by picketing in demonstrations which went on over a period about 13 months In June or so 1966 up until approximately June 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.912" offset="440424">During that period, the Texas Rangers, five of whom were defendants in this case and who are the only defendants who have appealed, were called in first, I believe the record will show in about November in 1966 for the purpose apparently then of serving ten warrants on people who had already been charged with committing the violation of having a secondary strike by the local authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.534" offset="550870">The ranger came in to serve those ten warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.283" offset="573858">The rangers came in to the area again in May of 1967 at the request of local officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.229" offset="621714">And from that time until the picketing ended in June of 1967, about roughly six weeks, a two-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.817" offset="664033">The rangers made several arrest in this area obstructing which covered the number of counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.653" offset="687334">It covered up a large number of structures and picketers.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.027" offset="704888">The arrest made by the defendant rangers during this approximately six week or perhaps shorter period in that, total amount 45 including 28 for mass picketing under Texas statute, 14 for unlawful assembly and one for no driver’s license, one for threatening the life of a ranger and one for brandishing a weapon on the public part.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.040" offset="1580931">This period of 13 months or so was marked by actual vandalism as the record show directed toward farm owners in the sense of finding sugar in gas tanks, punctured tractor tires, stolen generator and that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.355" offset="1654178">The three-judge court found that the law for including the ranger defendants had acted unlawful towards the strikers by harassing them and intimidating them for the purpose of ending the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.035" offset="1708931">In June of 1967, state civil injunctive proceeding was filed in the State District Court of Starr County; one of the counties involved in a case filed La Casita Farms versus AFL-CIO Organizing Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.895" offset="1788343">An injunction relating to La Casita Farm was rendered by the Court in July of 1967, enjoining all picketing against La Casita, which was one of the major employee in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.851" offset="1856157">On the basis that the picketing were shown to be so intertwine with violence and disruption that it passed any legitimate form of communications so that all picketers was enjoined of La Casita Farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.407" offset="1926374">The Union appealed the injunction to the Court of Civil Appeal to Texas and Trial Court was affirmed in that reporting to 439 S. W. 2d 398.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.193" offset="5697515">I’d like to touch very briefly on the question of equal protection under our 54d statute which applies to labor organizations and does not by its term applied to other organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.685" offset="5767523">Were where Mr. Justice Marshall’s decision to Moseley as the Courts aware there were statute in Chicago which held that they stated that had to be no demonstrations around a public school within a 150 feet of that public school except that labor disputes were not so enjoined or so restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.749" offset="5867729">This Court found that to be a violation of equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.638" offset="5887269">We would submit Your Honors that our case differs from that and serve with important respects for one the restriction that is imposed by our statute as it intersects with First Amendment rights is a valid and legal restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.905" offset="5960411">I thank the court even though decided mostly on equal protection grounds, seem to have on its mind some what the concept that is was difficult or shouldn’t briefly allowed to enjoin the kind of public issue picketing that was prohibited by the statute in the Chicago case, the Moseley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.245" offset="6057691">I urge as we stated before is a reasonable restriction on the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.511" offset="6078798">The other and perhaps more important station I think is that in Moseley the Court was confronted with the situation where of the entire universe of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.644" offset="6131357">A small area that is labor picketing had been singled out and not regulated being the risk of the universe had been assumed to be bad and regulated by the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.433" offset="6170436">In our situation we have the flip part of that, we have the entire universe picketing all unregulated by our statute except the narrow portion of the labor picketing which is regulated for the reason set out in the preamble of our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.811" offset="6235951">And we say that in that sense we have made a reasonable classification and that the equal protection statements made in the Moseley case do not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.406" offset="6302407">Additionally, in that regard we’ve mentioned to the Court that there was no suggestion made, no proof made of any arbitrariness in this statute by the plaintiffs as they tried the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.539" offset="8426893">On May 11, the Union developed important support on the Mexican side and the situation developed that the Mexican farmworkers were not coming across the bridge to work through these picket lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.467" offset="8490632">On that day at 4 o’clock in the morning Captain Allee, the Texas Ranger got up out of bed and drove 1 or 200 miles forthwith to the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.457" offset="8530547">Then there, started a series of arrests, interspersed with brutality, beatings, terrorism, the works from May 11 until June 1 and on June 1, the Union threw up its hands and no one could get adherence under those conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.672" offset="8779442">Of course you’re aware of the fact that the District Court found that none of these things was brought forth to the union or any of its members in the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.658" offset="8819357">This District Court found that and they also found that in the entire year, the only case, a physical violence was when one of our people reached and touched the arm of a truck driver as he passed by taking him by the sleeve and the sleeve of course slipped out of the man’s hand and the truck went on and the District Court explicitly found that that was the only case of physical violence on the part that any Union adherent during the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.526" offset="8934818">Now to go to your other question Your Honor, down in South Texas you get about four crops a year and there is a planting time and there is a harvesting time and these rise of arrests took place at the times when the Union would accelerate at its activities to reach the workers during the planting time, during the harvesting time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.052" offset="9020918">That’s when the workforce is large, that’s when the Union would make its effort to organize and that’s when the arrest would take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.656" offset="9055399">So the arrest well timed to kill direct the potential effectiveness of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.108" offset="9085179">Now, to move on, this case was found as a class action by the union and by several individuals and the Court found that it was a proper class action by this people and they are adequate representatives of the class and there has never been any question in the District Court from the defendant and not the propriety of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.789" offset="9179951">The fact findings recite that there was a one year conspiracy of arrest without charges, dispersals, threats, bonding abuses, inducements by peace officers to the strikers to abandon there’s the union and go back to work and physical violence, all of it was mixed up with an interspersed with the institution of prosecutions in bad faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.316" offset="13618051">The United Farm Worker versus La Casita case was affirmed by the Texas Court Civil Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.661" offset="14067357">That’s clear enough to case here.</text>
