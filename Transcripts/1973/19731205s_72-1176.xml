            <text syncTime="12.122" offset="125283">This case is here on a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.292" offset="157884">North Dakota passed a statute which required a pharmacist, if a corporation, to have a majority of its stock owned by registered pharmacist in good standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.406" offset="230400">Respondent, Snyder’s Drug Stores Incorporation, applied for a permit to run a pharmacy in the State and was denied the permit on the basis of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.143" offset="281287">On appeal by Snyder to the Supreme Court, the North Dakota Supreme Court held that the statute was unconstitutional on the basis of our decision, the Court’s decision, in 1928 in the Liggett case from Pennsylvania involving a like statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.717" offset="379611">There are two points in the opinion dealt with it in some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.022" offset="404793">First is the question of whether or not the judgment is final for our purposes within the meaning of Section 28, U.S. Code 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.208" offset="445544">We hold for reasons stated in the opinion that it is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.571" offset="459024">And coming to the merits, we conclude that the Liggett case, decided in 1928, is out of line and consistent with the decisions handed down since that time that the statute of North Dakota is constitutional and that the Liggett case is, therefore, overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.665" offset="543451">As a result we have reverse and remand the case for further proceeding.</text>
