            <label>Mr. John H. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="59.073" offset="313051">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.481" offset="322664">My Name is John Anderson and I represent in these consolidated cases, the California Bankers Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.492" offset="354743">These consolidated cases entail a challenge to an Act of Congress passed late in 1970 that has become to be known as the Bank Secrecy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.050" offset="396957">And in our discussions today, I think that initially important to distinguish as much as we can at all times between the two aspects of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.909" offset="444395">One aspect to that Act entails and requires the banks uninsured and otherwise of this nation to microfilm and copy virtually every piece of paper that flows through the domestic banking system and to keep that paper microfilmed before a period ranging from two to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.765" offset="527778">The second part of the Act, Title II requires banks to make reports of certain kinds of designated currency transactions, domestic and foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.585" offset="587128">With that background in mind and in June of 1972, the private litigants in this case initiated in an action in United States District Court for the Northern District of California seeking to enjoin enforcement of both the recordkeeping and the reporting sections of the Bank Secrecy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.456" offset="670616">With one judge dissenting a three-judge court denied motions to enjoin enforcements of the recordkeeping section of the act but granted an injunction enjoining enforcement of the automatic reporting provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.166" offset="733414">The Government has appealed from that portion of that order enjoining enforcement of the reporting provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.110" offset="765179">The private litigants have appealed from that portion of the order refusing to enjoin the so called recordkeeping sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.264" offset="801855">Let me begin with a very brief summary description of just what those record -- excuse me, reporting provisions entail.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.581" offset="839053">The Act compels reports of all domestic currency transactions found by the secretary “have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory investigatings -- investigations or proceedings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="209.955" offset="916584">The implementing regulations currently enforced require banks among others to report automatically all $10,000.00 currency transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.935" offset="964441">And I should interject here that when I say currently enforced I use the phrase advisably because the Act authorizes and the regulations following through on that authorize a change in that dollar amount or in fact the definition of transaction at any time by the treasury secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.977" offset="1044689">The transaction report of the currency transaction requires disclosure of a wide variety of information, including the name, address and business or profession of the party involved in the transaction, the name, address and business of the party or business entity for whom it may have been conducted --</text>

            <text syncTime="267.510" offset="1146776">This is a currency transaction Mr. Justice Brennan which is defined in the regulations as being cash or near cash monetary instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.063" offset="1188989">It does not entail for example a situation in which a person would go into a bank and simply deposit a check and not take out any currency.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.541" offset="1234860">That would included and as a matter of fact, in listing the requirements that must be reported at the time of a designated transaction, it requires a description of the nature of the transaction whatever that means together with the tight amount and denomination of the currency involved and a description of any check involved in the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.163" offset="1485427">That is not further defined in the regulations Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.285" offset="1497861">However, I will like to interject in one time, there is an exception to the reporting requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.756" offset="1519804">The exception itself is the basis for one of our challenges to the constitutionality of this Act and it reads in words in effect to the following proposition that “if the bank in its judgment decides that this transaction is normal and regular for the person engaging in it, i.e. perhaps of a store which deals in large amount of cash that it need be reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.643" offset="1611337">However, we submit that the description is so vague as to leave the banks in a position of not knowing when in fact a prescribed transaction has occurred and since in fact there are criminal penalties, attendant refusal or failure to give the report, it raises a serious due process notice problem in our mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.722" offset="1683644">I suppose, on the face of it that would mean, if I came in twice a week with checks for $15,000.00 to be cashed, a time might come when the bank would sink -- was no reason any longer to take that information from me because it’s a regular, even though I might be kingpin of the robbery racket?</text>

            <text syncTime="421.596" offset="1763161">That is correct Mr. Justice Brennan, however it has to be said that the regulation is couched in terms of regular and normal for the business or profession involved, I suppose --</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="541.020" offset="2240784">Well, it is simply to say that in every instance that whenever a $10,000.00 currency transaction occurs of which they are in the case of large commercial banks, presumably many hundred a day, that a report would be required to be filed and I think my brother from the Solicitor General's office would agree that’s not what the treasury department wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.421" offset="2310478">It wants reports of transactions which in the judgment of the bank are unusual for that particular depositor.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.090" offset="2341094">The result otherwise would be a simple inundation of the Treasury Department with reports, which it presumably couldn’t use and would be useless to the extent of 95%.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.597" offset="2379128">So I -- I think as a practical matter I’d have to answer in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.707" offset="2399608">The summary with respect to the reporting obligation I think can be put as simply this, that when the transaction occurred, the banks by some fashion are obligated to obtain a wide variety of information, about that transaction which in the absence of the compulsion under this Act, they would under no circumstances need for their own banking purposes, this is an obligation imposed by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.476" offset="2494694">Now, turning to a very brief summary description of the recordkeeping, the Act makes a finding of adequate records, have a high degree of usefulness in the same words; criminal, tax and regulatory investigations or proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.867" offset="2564180">It makes a further finding that microfilm or other copies of bank records are highly useful and the Act then provides that, and I am quoting now “where the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the maintenance of appropriate types of records and other evidence by insured banks has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings, he shall prescribe records -- regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="655.379" offset="2698240">Now, the regulations and alleged implementation of foregoing purposes of the Act have required the banks of the United States to copy and to retain as I have said for a period of -- from two to five years, virtually every single piece of paper that finds it way into the American Domestic Banking System with two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.620" offset="2791236">One exception has to do with payroll checks emanating from a large payroll.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.946" offset="5388539">Two examples; firearms dealers in which there is a requirement that records to be kept for the purpose of regulating that particular business which is deemed by the Congress to be dangerous or to have some import beyond the normal sale of wares.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.276" offset="5945887">Well, Mr. Justice White, I think the difficulty with that is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.517" offset="5962815">First of all, in the case in which Congress has compelled reporting or recordkeeping for the purpose of enforcing a specific law, Congress has gone through the process of deciding whether the recordkeeping in that case is justified, warranted and so on and so forth, there's been some weighing of its utility in a particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.357" offset="6034181">Secondly, this Court, I would submit would find it extremely difficult to test the reasonableness of this recordkeeping when the objective is not against a particular criminal statute or not against a particular civil law, but is in aid of all Government interest, however, defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.557" offset="6102936">The special evil it seems to me particularly with respect to the recordkeeping is that there appear to be any number of alternatives available which are not explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.326" offset="6134073">And unlike the case, for example the tax laws or some of the other civil regulatory laws in which recordkeeping or reporting by the entity involved appears to be absolutely essential to its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.252" offset="6193737">The sheer arrest records that are available and to some extent are quoted in our brief would suggest that this not the only way in which the criminal and civil and regulatory laws of the United States can be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.797" offset="8443925">The Government’s only answer to that is to quote Mr. Justice White’s opinion in United States versus White and say it’s just like a willing informant receiving information from a willing confidant and turning it over to the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.193" offset="8589479">The Government basically says that if you know these people are agencies of the Government, something not known, in Aurthur and White, your choice is to keep dealing with them and will call that voluntary or to give up banking and for that matter financial institutions entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.239" offset="8649665">You may carry your cash to everybody you owe money to even if it’s the other end of the country or you may deal voluntarily with the agent of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.847" offset="8688118">We think that that distorts the meaning of the term voluntary beyond all recognition and that is the only answer the Government has to our theory that when a bank makes or keeps a record, it would not otherwise make or keep in its business judgment, it acts as an agent of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.911" offset="8744438">If it does that then analytically, there is no difference between the required reports and the required records because the search of the records has to be measured as of the time the agent of the Government, i.e. the bank, acts and copies the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.559" offset="8802952">Now, there is solid precedent aside from this agency theory for equating the constitutional effect of the recordkeeping and the reporting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.787" offset="8983928">Here, the situation is worse because the subpoena issues to a bank that has no such adversary interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.745" offset="9115690">Even if they do, the Government’s reading of Couch and Donaldson would give no standing to the parties to assert Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights should that subpoena ever be discovered by them in time to litigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.164" offset="9165427">Under our reading of course, the costumer does have Fourth and Fifth Amendment interest in records not otherwise made or kept in the business judgment of the bank and would under Couch and Donaldson have standing to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.964" offset="9212656">But even that would not avail the costumer a very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.502" offset="9226762">Let’s suppose that I am prosecuted on the basis of a copy of a check subpoenaed from my bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.492" offset="9254766">The Government says, “Well, it will be time enough for you to raise your Fourth and Fifth Amendment objections when you are prosecuted on the basis of the check.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.537" offset="9286844">What would I have to prove?</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.805" offset="9291964">I would have to prove that in the ordinary business practice of my bank, the check would not have been copied and it was, but for the Act that the check was copied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.528" offset="9326864">Now, since ordinary business practice stopped -- practice stopped in July 1, 1972 when this regulations went into effect and since they went into effect because of rapid technological change as the years go by, that burden of proof changes from very difficult which it is now to impossible which it will be in a few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.413" offset="9402410">Next, the Government says, “Well, you have time enough to raise these objections when you're prosecuted or otherwise proceeded against without paying any attention to the relief we ask here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.718" offset="9439608">If I successfully suppress that check, all I get is the suppression of one check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.152" offset="9457371">We ask here for the invalidation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.574" offset="9467089">But finally and most important when the Government says that it is time -- time enough when the subpoena is served in your bank, should you luck -- be lucky enough to find out about it and litigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.476" offset="9506691">To litigate these questions, it ignores the difference between the Fourth Amendment in the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.542" offset="9530932">As Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out quite correctly in this opinion for the Court in U.S. v. Robinson only last month, virtually all of this Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has arisen since Weeks versus United States and in the context of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.946" offset="9588506">This is one of the rare and happy cases in which you have innocent parties before you asking for the protection of privacy afforded by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.430" offset="9622465">The Government saying that we’re premature in this case because we haven’t been preceded against ignores the fact that the Fourth Amendment protects the innocent as well as the guilty to invert an old phrase, and ignores the fact that the Fourth Amendment protects privacy, not guilty secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.343" offset="9682129">And so we are not prematurely here even assuming that we get notice of a subpoena of our bank account, even assuming we could litigate all this questions under Couch and Donaldson, now is the time, perhaps the only time in which these issues can be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.883" offset="9756317">Finally, there is a connection between the Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment which makes the separation of them by the Government, we think indefensible in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.351" offset="9794142">This Court has not had a majority for what Boyd versus United States means with respect to the intimate connection between the two amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.333" offset="9826116">Since Boyd was decided in 1886, Mr. Justice Marshall’s exploration of the several different interpretations of that intimate relationship in his dissent in the Couch case throws some light on the issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.665" offset="9879406">But I think to quote Mr. Justice Frankfurter when he was writing for the Court in Frank versus Maryland later overruled, in some excellent dictum, he said, “It is not necessary to accept any particular theory of the interrelationship of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.235" offset="9941682">To understand what lies, not at its periphery but at its core, self-protection, self-protection of a party from being compelled to create and produce evidence against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.862" offset="9984209">The central purpose, the purpose as the Government calls it, of the Bank Secrecy Act, is to force private citizens to create and deliver to the Government or hold for its later obtaining by means of judicial process or otherwise, evidence of crime, their own or someone else’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.602" offset="10051187">Now, if the Government told everybody, told private citizens to keep watch on their neighbor, record their comings and goings, report anything unusual that would be different from this case only in the fact that they were speaking to private citizens not regulated industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.837" offset="10112104">The Government here argues that the difference is constitutionally critical because it has plenary regulatory power over banks, it can order banks for purposes foreign to that power to keep watch over its costumers and their relation with still other fourth parties in order to enforce the criminal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.241" offset="11253760">I should say before I begin that I asked the clerk to distribute a little Xerox copy because the regulations as they’re reproduced in the appendix to our jurisdictional statement and in the appendices to the California Bankers Association briefs omitted some intervening changes which made them inaccurate in minor respects that don’t affect the argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.148" offset="11357309">Principally 103.35 is the one that can’t really be reconstructed without the aid of this, but with these in your hands along with the others, it will be possible to see what all of the regulations currently are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.744" offset="11423765">They were amended in both December of 1972 and January of 1973 and the current regulations are reprinted in the Code of Federal Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.148" offset="11473293">The Act was enacted by Congress in 1970, following extensive and detailed hearings concerning the wide spread use made by persons in the United States of foreign bank accounts in bank secrecy jurisdictions for the purpose of concealing violations of the United States tax regulatory and criminal laws or concealing the fruits of such violations and concerning the difficulties in enforcing federal tax, regulatory and criminal laws that had been caused by the failure of some domestic banks and other financial institutions to keep adequate records of checking account transactions and of the identity of their costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.893" offset="11708291">The purpose of the Act is to make available greater evidence of financial transactions in order to deter the use of the channels of commerce for illicit purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.521" offset="11770880">Or in the words of the Senate Report, “In order to reduce the incidence of white collar crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.853" offset="11808183">Titles I and II of the of the Act and their implementing regulations were challenged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.968" offset="11844650">Title I is the recordkeeping provisions and Title II are the reporting provisions which basically are in two parts for purposes of our concerns here; the reports of domestic currency transactions and reports of foreign financial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.698" offset="11939527">The Act’s provisions are not self-executing, but are designed to be implemented by treasury regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.686" offset="11983517">Congress made clear its intention that those regulations were to focus both the recordkeeping and the reporting requirements on financial information having a -- in the phrase of both the House Committee Report and in the Act itself, a high degree of usefulness in criminal tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings and by self focusing the requirements to avoid undue burdens on the free flow of domestic and international commerce and finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.207" offset="12141610">After the Act's purpose or passage, after the Act’s passage in keeping with this Congressional purpose, a treasury department taskforce undertook a detailed study in consultation with representatives of financial institutions, of trade associations and of Government agencies to determine the specific categories of records and reports which should be required to implement the Act and the regulations emanated from rulemaking proceedings involving this taskforce studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.719" offset="12287582">They were first adopted in April of 1972 and then were amended in December of that year and in January of 1973, after further comment in rulemaking proceedings and also in light of further Senate hearings on proposed amendments to the Act that were conducted in August of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.968" offset="12388624">And that is why there are sometimes citations to Senate hearings which discussed the regulations that have already been developed under Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.766" offset="12431778">Those proposed amendments had to do with proposals to restrict access to the records which Congress has not enacted, but the Amendments to the regulations do specify restrictions on access by others in the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.342" offset="12526132">The -- and original legislative history made it clear that the recordkeeping provisions did not expand access from it was under established legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.956" offset="12576601">Now, turning first to the recordkeeping provisions of Title I as implemented by the regulations and these provisions were upheld by the District Court, these require financial institutions in the United States to record the identities of their account holders and require banks to make -- to maintain microfilm or other records of checks drawn on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.322" offset="12729992">These are requirements with respect to “on us checks” only for sums in excess of $100.00 dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.579" offset="12775027">And then, there are -- in addition to checks for $100.00 or less, there are other exceptions developed and these are in the amended regulations that are listed on page 22 of the brief, this is our brief for the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.655" offset="12863321">There are a number of briefs in the case as you know, and the Government brief, is appellee on page 22, we summarize the other exceptions, dividend checks and payroll checks and others so long as they are drawn on an account, expected to average at least $100.00 checks per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.355" offset="12970214">All together then, that was exceptions coupled with the exception for all checks of one hundred dollars or lees add up to a very substantial exception to the microfilming requirements which have been the main focus of the complainant’s contentions in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4076.935" offset="16384522">Mr. Wallace, I do have one more question about the recordkeeping provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.291" offset="16401868">I get the impression from your argument that there was -- at least some testimony before Congress to the effect that banks were shifting away from retaining these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.971" offset="16440633">The reason I ask is because my own experience in private practice is just what Justice White and Justice Powell intimated in their questions that I can’t remember ever having any trouble subpoenaing a check record from a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.548" offset="16490893">It seems to me that in my own little locale, they kept them several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.136" offset="16509283">So, was this in effect an effort by Congress to see that a -- what had been an adequate voluntary system was preserved when there was an impetuous to turn away from it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="4118.372" stopTime="4369.416">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="4118.372" offset="16550243">That was the major thrust of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.640" offset="16559334">And that was the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.023" offset="16564872">It was just a very few of the largest banks that had decided that it wasn’t worth their while to photocopy everything and to keep these records as long as they had in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.268" offset="16613773">In fact the House Committee Report said that most banks would be virtually unaffected by this particular aspect of the requirements and that it is just a few size of the ones, the Bank of America was particularly testified about and that is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.010" offset="16684826">So, the principle as we understand it, of the California Bankers Association argument that this is undue burden whether that stated as a Fourth or Fifth Amendment objection and it’s hard for us to see why a recordkeeping requirement is a search or seizure, but it seems to us it has to be more a Fifth Amendment objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.274" offset="16789838">That is answered by the consideration, it seems to us that Congress gave to the needs that the Government had as a necessary improper means of facilitating enforcement of tax, regulatory, and criminal laws that this would not be undue burden and I don’t think this Congressional judgment as been shown by anything presented in the record here not be an entirely constitutional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.152" offset="16941349">The other objections that had been raised to the requirements by the individuals, if I can just summarize, our position with respect to them quite briefly, we don’t see that there's been any compulsion on the individual with respect to the recordkeeping requirements that would form a predicate for a Fifth Amendment objection nor had any of the individuals before the Court claimed that anything required would tend to incriminate them which is a necessary predicate for a Fifth Amendment objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.751" offset="17095784">There is no basis in the legislative history or purpose or anything that was developed in the course of developing the regulations for belief that the Government was going to seek to get the membership list of any particular organization and therefore the First Amendment claim seems to us to be a -- too speculative for presentation to the Court, a fortiori on the basis of this Court’s decision last term in Laird against Tatum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.196" offset="17245518">Since there isn’t even any data gathering by the Government yet shown to be taking place in the present case and the data gathering was in involved in Laird by the Government in Laird against Tatum although no use of that data printing in proper or likelihood of that use had been shown of the Fourth Amendment claim seems to me that there's no search or seizure being made of the costumer because the bank with whom he’s dong with business is required to keep records of its financial transactions with him and other costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.425" offset="17462439">Into the extent that -- it could be said and we suggest some reasons why it may not be accurate to say so that the bank is operating as a Government agent, it is never been held by any court to my knowledge that the Fourth Amendment is violative when the Government keeps records of its dealings (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="4381.449" offset="17602560">Well, in the same sense, that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.304" offset="17609979">And they're required to keep many records and the thrust of the argument of the individuals here is that when they have dealings with the Government and the Government keeps records of those transactions that the Government has engaged in assuming that the bank is acting as an agent of the Government that somehow raises a Fourth Amendment violation to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.391" offset="17710289">That is merely the Government’s keeping of records of information voluntarily disclosed to the Government by someone doing business with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.932" offset="17756473">We don’t really think that the analogy of a Government agent is the accurate one here, but without that analogy there's no search or seizure with respect to the individual at all here since there’ no access by the Government provided by the Act to the records that are required to be kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.853" offset="17836199">Now, the domestic currency transaction reporting provisions of Title II or the part of the Act that was struck down by the District Court, this is actually the least innovative feature of the Act because since 1945, financial institutions have been providing reports under the Trading with the Enemy Act and implementing regulations and also under Section 2 of 51 of the revised statutes which was another basis for those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.449" offset="17994501">Of essentially similar information and these had been of proven efficacy in the enforcement of the Internal Revenue Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.262" offset="18053747">Treasury report indicative for example that in 1957 and 1958 alone, 129 fraud cases have been developed involving -- which led to the generation of 13 and a half million dollars in additional taxes in penalties based directly on information derived from these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.036" offset="18148937">And the Congressional objective in providing for such reporting requirements in the new Act was to make the standards for such reports by the institutions more definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.949" offset="18224588">The hearings indicated that the criminal use of financial institutions had increased in recent years and there was much testimony and findings in the Committee reports indicating that large amounts of cash are generated and have to be concealed in illicit transactions and also have to be converted to assure the ultimate success of those transactions into usable forms of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.858" offset="18344229">And so these provisions in their implementing regulations were included in the Act and these regulations require reports only by the financial institutions of these transactions not by any individuals and only of currency transactions in excess of $10,000.00 and not commensurate with the customary conduct of the business of an established costumer of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.098" offset="18481110">The information to reported is summarized in our brief, this time, it's -- our brief as appellant, on pages 14 and 15 in the text of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.383" offset="18530325">The information is relatively simple and its to be secured from the party to the transaction, the other party, the transaction by the bank as a condition of the banks engaging in such transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.300" offset="18617992">And this is again a regulation of the activities of the banks in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.602" offset="18655190">The District Court -- the rationale of the District Court in striking down these provisions of the Act was as we have contended in detail in our brief entirely hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.054" offset="18700957">It was based on the speculation that it might be possible to have implementing regulations which would require the reporting of other transactions, other than those specified in the regulations including the reporting of all transactions by check on -- personal checking accounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="5389.675" offset="21635448">It wasn’t even introduced in the proceedings in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.330" offset="21650077">There wasn’t an objection raised at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.275" offset="21661884">The only basis on which the individuals before the Court claimed that they can race the issue, is not that they have engaged or contemplate engaging in this cash transactions, but that the Act as a whole is not separable and that if this invalid, the parts that concern them are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.683" offset="21739520">It seems to us that the concerns expressed by Congress about why they needed to have the various provisions pretty well refute the contention if the Court found one aspect of it to be invalid that it should strike down the entire Act, indeed the fact that a substantially similar, domestic reporting provisions antedated the act under the Trading with the Enemy Act and stood alone for many years indicates that Congress didn’t think all of these had to be one package.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.492" offset="21894687">Now, I’d like to say just a few words about the foreign transaction reporting provisions of Title II in their implementing regulations which were upheld by the Court below and which require reports of the transactions of the individuals here do say they engage in of transportations of monetary instruments involving more than $5,000.00 into or out of the United States and reports by persons in the United States of their relationships with foreign financial institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.672" offset="22055393">Much of the testimony developed in the hearings was concerned with the very serious problems caused by the concealing or purifying of fruits of domestic criminal activity in the concealing of on going violations of tax, regulatory and criminal laws by the use of secret bank accounts in a Bank Secrecy Jurisdictions, accounts over which Congress does not have direct regulatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.425" offset="22206485">The examples given were detailed and varied of the evasions of capital gains taxes through sales of security of illegal trading in gold, the concealing of securities manipulations, the concealing of insider trading in securities and numerous other examples, a man making a loan to himself from his own secret bank account and then deducting the interest payments that it is one that I recall from the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.573" offset="22355069">It was testified by Robert Morgan Thaw (ph), former United States attorney of the Southern District of New York that in his estimation, thousands of such accounts involving hundreds of millions of dollars were being used for illicit purposes and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Randolph Thrower testified that the integrity of the self-assessment system of the taxation itself was being threatened by the use of these accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.789" offset="22491951">The objections that have been raised to this are first of all a claim that there might be a problem under the self-incrimination provision of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.439" offset="22546495">We don’t believe that claim is before the Court because no one in Court has said that filing such a report would tend to incriminate him which is the prerequisite for raising any claim of privilege under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.081" offset="22617025">And in any event the claim would be premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.121" offset="22633221">These are reports to be filed with the Internal Revenue return itself and under the Sullivan case, the claim should be made -- it's going to be made on the return and under Marchetti and Grosso, even if there was something so inherently incriminating here that the individual would be justified in not filing any report at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.284" offset="22733845">That would not mean that they’re entitled to the kind of relief they have sought in this case which is invalidating the entire Act because others might well be able to comply without incriminating themselves and indeed it's very likely that couriers and others would comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.926" offset="22804480">The Marchetti and Grosso cases both specifically said the tax there was not being struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.386" offset="22826318">They were merely upholding a valid claim of privilege made by someone who showed that he couldn’t file the report required without incriminating himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5699.669" offset="22875429">And the Fourth Amendment and the claims that are made with respect to this provision seem us to be answered by the cases saying that reports required for valid regulatory purposes are not an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.744" offset="22947736">The Court said, “This is far back as Boyd in the passage that we refer to.”</text>
