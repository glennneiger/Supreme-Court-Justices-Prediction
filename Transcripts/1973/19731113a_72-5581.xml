            <label>Mr. Howard Moore, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="29.568" offset="194978">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.856" offset="208144">My name is Howard Moore, Jr. I represent the petitioner Richard Guy Steffel.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.694" offset="227474">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.314" offset="254015">That judgment affirmed the denial of declaratory judgment by United States District Court, the Northern District of Georgia, in an action in which a declaratory judgment is sought against the threatened, a non-pending state criminal prosecution for Trespass in the Georgia Law Section 26 -- Section 1503 26 Georgia Code Annotated.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.866" offset="336248">The issue presented and to be decided by this Court is whether the standard set forth in Younger v. Harris and Samuel -- Samuels against Mackell may be applied to deny a petitioner declaratory relief where there was no pending state criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.396" offset="406361">The factual background out of which this controversy arises is as follows, there were impressively two events.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.333" offset="438126">The first event occurred on October 8, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.846" offset="452127">The petitioner and a young lady by the name of Sandra Becker, both members of an incorporated association known as the Atlanta Mobilization Committee stood outside on the exterior sidewalks of a food store located in the North DeKalb Shopping Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.441" offset="526524">Their purpose for their being there was to participate in handbilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.262" offset="541780">They were passing out handbills to invite the public to attend an anti-war rally in downtown Atlanta on Saturday, October 31 to solicit support for the Atlanta Mobilization Committee and to urge support for the lady's boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.290" offset="601861">A copy of a handbill which they were handling out on that occasion is attached to the appendix at page 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.335" offset="630073">The duration of the handbilling was about a -- about half an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.894" offset="652330">During the time they were handbilling, they were quiet and they were peaceful and there was no unreasonable littering, if any littering at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.867" offset="680229">The handbilling was then disrupted by the shopping center’s security guard, who ordered the petitioner to cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.515" offset="710844">When the petitioner explained that he was exercising his constitutional right, DeKalb County Police were called.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.569" offset="734981">Police told petitioner and Mrs. Becker, if they did not discontinue that peaceful handbilling, they would be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.990" offset="760686">The petitioner and Mrs. Becker left rather than being arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.709" offset="775628">The second incident occurred on October 10, 1970, when the petitioner and Mrs. Becker distributed handbills from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. about four hours at the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.796" offset="827977">They conducted themselves on that occasion in an orderly and peaceful manner, to deny the view of the shopping center or commercial activities of the center and the disruption of the handbilling occurred again, when a security guard told the petitioner and Mrs. Becker to cease handbilling and leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.455" offset="898612">The manager of the shopping center called the DeKalb Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.019" offset="908852">The police came again, the petitioner left, Mrs. Becker refused to leave and she was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.441" offset="950544">On the 16th of October, the petitioner began his efforts at judicial relief or redress, by filing a complaint in the United States District Court to the Northern District of Georgia for declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds of Section 1503 of the Georgia Code as applied to his and Mrs. Becker’s conduct deprived them of the First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.017" offset="1044793">A hearing, an evidentiary hearing was held on October 28, 1970 and the Court then later in January of 1971, state further proceedings in the case to await the decision of this Court in Samuels against Mackell and other cases which the Court mentioned in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.509" offset="1126818">Then following the decision in Younger and Samuels, the District Judge applied Younger and Samuels to deny the petitioner of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.733" offset="1159732">Although petitioner was won against them, there was no pending criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.904" offset="1188362">The District Judge was of the opinion that the petitioner had failed to show irreparable injury as defined by this Court and the defendants’ claim lack the rudiments of an active controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.325" offset="1234024">Steffel then appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.517" offset="1238831">Mrs. Becker and the Atlanta Mobilization Committee who were petitioners in the District Court did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.849" offset="1264118">The District Court in a divided opinion, applied Younger and Samuels to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.868" offset="1296196">The Court of Appeals was of the opinion and stated in his opinion that that was no different in effect in a declaratory judgment where there was no -- where there was not a pending criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.449" offset="1350531">Then there was in one point there was a pending criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.979" offset="1364637">And it saw no difference in reasoning and therefore applied Younger and Samuels to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.501" offset="1398700">Judge Tuttle dissented from the extension of Younger and Samuels to this case but he concurred in the results on a different ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.461" offset="1434540">Judge Tuttle would have affirmed on the authority of Cameron against Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.661" offset="1455438">A motion was filed for rehearing and the rehearing was denied, three judges dissented from the denial of the rehearing and their opinion is before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.370" offset="1734217">The District Court didn’t say what rudiments were missing?</text>
            <text syncTime="417.435" offset="1746442">It made no findings that made a conclusion but not defining the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.056" offset="1788970">There is no statement of facts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.614" offset="1795239">I think that was clearly erroneous, clearly wrong because the petitioner on two occasions had been actually threatened with the enforcement of this specific statute not with some different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.686" offset="1847484">But he himself on two occasions was threatened with the statute and it is a force of that statute and his obedience to that statute that has prevented him from returning to the shopping center to handbill so there is that adversity of interest because he would like very much to go out and handbill.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Howard Moore, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="462.410" offset="1926374">I would think -- I hope so.[Laughter Attempt]</text>
            <text syncTime="465.373" offset="1938286">The Court of Appeal did not say so, but I think that there is enough in the record on the facts where this Court can meet that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.848" offset="1976111">It is the petitioner’s position that the Younger -- Samuels standards were incorrectly applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.072" offset="2012996">In the context of a threatened prosecution, the application of the Younger and Samuels’s standards of irreparable injury are inappropriate and they’re inappropriate for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.137" offset="2077257">The majority, I should say that the majority of the lower courts have with the exception of the Fifth Circuit, refused to apply Younger and Samuels rule of equitable non-intervention to situations such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.962" offset="2128562">The restraining principles of comity which in Younger and Samuels are inapplicable where the relief requested poses no threat to an on-going state proceeding either criminal or non-criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.575" offset="2179030">As a practical -- a comity is not an absolute value.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.917" offset="2192405">As a practical matter, some balancing must be allowed to ensure that fundamental federal rights are not lost by blind compliance with comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.614" offset="2231171">The purposes underlying the development of this principle which include the avoidance of conflict with two courts, seeking to dispose of a same case in respect for the State Courts in the context of a threatened criminal -- threatened prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.991" offset="2284669">In Samuels, it was held that there is no difference between declaratory relief and injunctions with the respect to the disrupted impact each on the pending state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.377" offset="2322286">The purpose for equating the two forms of relief was to require a showing of irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.850" offset="2344124">In the context of a pending state court proceeding, there may be pragmatic reasons for requiring such a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.464" offset="2370560">These reasons, I submit to -- would include additional cause to judicial system of two on-going proceedings involving essentially the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.531" offset="2418834">Stopping of an on-going proceeding where a jurisdiction has vested in the State Court and the effect of judicial intervention by the Federal Court is to rest away, to take away from a State Court a matter over which each jurisdiction has rested and you run into a principle that does not necessarily have to be respected in all cases that ordinarily you don’t rest away jurisdiction from a court once it has vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.282" offset="2525832">You have then an indictment of a state process because implicit and federal intervention where there is [Interruption] going on, is that in some way the state prosecution is inadequate or that the state prosecution is in bad faith or that the state judges are corrupt, that the state fact-finding proceeding is inaccurate -- is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.568" offset="2619037">There are many of variables enacted -- referred to and that familiar to this Court but it is an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.051" offset="2640980">It is a slander so to speak of the state processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.294" offset="2657907">Another reason is the duplication of efforts in the disruption the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.047" offset="2676924">These reasons are not as compelling where a state prosecution has only been threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.217" offset="2697613">When no state court action is pending there is no assurance the constitutional rights will receive time and attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.348" offset="2722168">This case is an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.412" offset="2730423">It has been now over three years and Steffel still has not got any determination of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.350" offset="2754142">He still can’t return to the shopping center for the purposes of handbilling.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.163" offset="2889352">Now, recently more than two years after this incident, the shopping center filed an action for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Fulton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.533" offset="2934909">That action was dismissed for failure to state a claim among other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.903" offset="2952359">One of the other reasons for dismissing it was that there was primary jurisdiction before, I think before the National Labor Relations Board because the union was about --</text>

            <text syncTime="763.942" offset="3132500">Where irreparable harm to criteria for declaratory relief, rights and doubt may be sacrificed due to the difficulty in making such a showing, the decision that irreparable harm should not be a criterion for declaratory relief when no state action is pending is supported by legislative intent by case history and by the ways the Chief Architect of the federal declaratory judgment, Professor Borchard.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.191" offset="3233541">Federal intervention when the state prosecution is threatened is less disruptive of the state’s activities and similar intervention when a prosecution is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.851" offset="3268127">A decree of federal equitable relief would interfere only with the policing and prosecutorial function of the state’s executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.025" offset="3304803">When the prosecution is pending however, federal intervention interferes further with the activities of its judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.670" offset="3339389">The dual interests of the Federal Court in eliminating threats for constitutional violations and in avoiding unnecessary police interference might both be protected by directing appropriate orders to responsible officials they could correct the situation internally themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.132" offset="3401247">If there's a declaratory relief in a non-pending situation is that its non-coercive effect allows law enforcement officials to continue to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.315" offset="3450044">Now, declaratory judgment and injunctive relief should be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.838" offset="3468121">A declaratory judgment can be distinguished from the equitable relief of an injunction in several respects and I should indicate that declaratory judgment is not a legal remedy, not an equitable remedy rather but it's a legal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.576" offset="3523082">Some of the distinguishing factors are is that, one, a lack of an adequate legal remedy is a pre-requisite for injunctive relief but is not a criterion for declaratory relief, Rule 57 on the Federal Rules of Civil procedure points this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.585" offset="3587135">This has been a tradition -- a traditional and ancient, a requirement for the intervention of equity that that be an absence of an adequate remedy at law or other appropriate remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.218" offset="3629662">That was traditionally the way that the interest of equity was balanced against the interest of the lower court and gave rise more or less to the equity course by preventing embarrassment -- showing the ineffectiveness of equity by introducing or by decreeing an order that could not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.048" offset="3712940">By granting declaratory relief, the petitioner need not show the inappropriateness of other forms of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.958" offset="3740630">The petitioner need only show that the declaratory judgment can handle the dispute efficiently and economically.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.570" offset="3771037">Injunctive relief immunizes particular conduct by enjoining further prosecution whereas a declaration merely interprets the law and has no injunctive effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.904" offset="3872392">Well, it’s not completely abstract because this Court as well as the statute, the declaratory judgment statute has defined standards to determine when a controversy exists over which the District Court can assume jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.560" offset="3938952">So it’s not all together abstract that requires an exercise of judgment, discretion by the District Judge, whomever is determining the matter but it’s not entirely abstract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.698" offset="4355553">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.688" offset="4367464">To resume, I would like to resume with the question put to me by Mr. Justice Blackmun with respect to the application of Cameron against Johnson to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.266" offset="4417829">First of all, I want to point out that Cameron against Johnson is certainly controlled by Younger and by Samuels, the reason being that Cameron was a pending State Court prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.894" offset="4480313">There was active litigation in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.220" offset="4493584">The petitioners had filed an affidavit to quash on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.500" offset="4530782">Next of all, in Cameron against Johnson, the District Court did in fact issue a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.149" offset="4561293">But the declaratory judgment that the District Court issued was one which upheld the constitutionality of Mississippi’s anti-picketing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.282" offset="4625868">Next, Cameron against Johnson is a failure of proof case that there was a failure of the petitioners to prove bad faith or harassment or even selective prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.969" offset="4692637">Fourthly, the Younger and Samuels standard is certainly inappropriate in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.461" offset="4726596">That is of a threatened prosecution because in the context of a threatened prosecution, what is a bad faith threat to enforce a statute against specific conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.253" offset="4781767">What standards can be devised by this Court to make the application of the Younger and Samuels’ standards manageable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.482" offset="4822727">The standard in the context of a then prosecution is unreally because there’s hardly unimaginable way to fashion an appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.260" offset="4869747">I take for example, litigation in which we were involved in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.225" offset="4889600">The Atlanta Vietnam Moratorium Committee is an unreported case of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.525" offset="4914887">And there, what was sought, the petitioners sought the right to go down to the state capital and hold a meeting and to parade and have a demonstration in opposition to the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.662" offset="4967445">And they notified the governor of their intentions of what they plan to do and the government sent them back a telegram and in this telegram he said in part, “You will be permitted to host such a meeting on the capital grounds if your purpose is the same as that of the other moratorium meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.444" offset="5050514">And the ones planned for November which give aid and assistance to the enemies of this country which downgrade the United States Government and its flag and which are directed by the Communist and other enemies of this country with the support of Vietcong, you nor any of your group will be permitted to assemble on a capital ground for such purposes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.977" offset="5144660">Now, is that a good faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.468" offset="5162632">Is that a good bad faith threat to influence Georgia’s Trespass Statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.686" offset="5187500">Without a declaratory judgment action, what remedy would the petitioners have had in order to conduct their demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.754" offset="5227729">Fortunately, we do have declaratory judgment and the District Court did issue a declaratory judgment saying that the stated conduct of the sponsors of the meeting was constitutionally protected and that the governors had the right to his point of view but he could not impose his point of view on the sponsors of the demonstration so as to deny them the right to come down to a public building by an orderly demonstrate and orderly hold the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.919" offset="5340473">Of course, he would -- he could take action against them if their conduct went beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.148" offset="5365342">Cause violence, obstruction, and things that’s all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.628" offset="5375269">But that was not involved it was purely First Amendment activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.110" offset="5393136">So when under the standard, if the standard of Younger and Samuels is applied to a non-threatened -- to a threatened prosecution, when can the District Court reliably determine that to bad faith by irreparable harm is reliably shown?</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.005" offset="5464816">This is no way that you can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.735" offset="5471713">Unless this Court is going to be willing to cause a District Court Judges to try the state of mind of state prosecutors and state law enforcement agents to show that they intend to actually strike the threatened law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.352" offset="5546109">They actually intend to deprive persons of their constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.021" offset="5576829">Then we get into a serious question if the standard is extended to the non-threatened, to the threatened rather of prosecution of case and controversy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.424" offset="5622491">Next, with respect to this particular case, Judge Tuttle makes it clear in his concurrence in Steffel that it was a pending case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.783" offset="5683931">And he relies on the language of this Court in Cameron which talks about withdrawing the determination of guilt from the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.734" offset="5731683">And the only reason that the state move that nature could be made is because there was a pending prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.782" offset="5759896">But then this Court went on to say in the language that Judge Tuttle used to talk about securing protection which a prompt trial on appeal directly to this Court would provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.537" offset="5822903">However, in a threatened situation there is no prompt trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.426" offset="5846413">There is no appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.062" offset="5852996">So the rubric, the technique of a single prosecution being dispositive of the claims does not work and cannot work in a threatened prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.906" offset="5892389">The reason for there is nothing upon which it must be Cameron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.523" offset="5910883">Unless, a petitioner such as Steffel is required to break the law and it does not seem that a democratic society that prior to itself in the concept of ordered liberty would require actual law breaking in order for one to come in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.408" offset="5986429">Now in a similar case involving a similar question in the abortion case, the doctors and the women who were seeking abortions and had not actually been moved against under the state statutes were allowed to enjoy the benefit of a declaratory judgment in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.943" offset="6076500">So I think that basically, that Cameron against Johnson is not controlling, it cannot be controlling in this case because Cameron against Johnson is more correctly a pending prosecution case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.897" offset="6128327">To move on where I was -- where I left of before recess, another distinguishing factor between the declaratory judgment and injunctive relief is that the state can disregard a declaratory judgment and not be cited for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.239" offset="6209724">But it can be held in contempt for disregarding an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.193" offset="6225502">Again, in the abortion cases, this Court relied upon the obligation under the constitution of state officials to obey decisions of this Court which are the Supreme law of the land and to obey the decisions of this Court voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.338" offset="6290077">I’ve been notified that my time is about to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.832" offset="6300108">In such time, as I have, I’d like to reserve it for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.303" offset="6345979">There are two issues in this case in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.861" offset="6356219">The first is whether Federal Courts in the exercise of their equitable jurisdiction should issue a declaration of rights as to the good faith enforcement of a facially valid state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.100" offset="6405120">There is no allegation in this case that there has either been bad faith harassment or a facial invalidity to the Georgia’s Criminal Trespass Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.933" offset="6444513">The second issue which I will address myself to is whether, where there is only the application of a state statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.472" offset="6474606">The statute first be given the opportunity under the doctrine of abstention to apply that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.805" offset="6499997">In our opinion, the Court of Appeals properly declined, properly dismissed the complaint here on the basis of its equitable jurisdiction and even if they have not, they would have properly abstained to design the question, retain jurisdiction until the Georgia Courts have spoken on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.970" offset="6564676">A federal declaration of right as to a state criminal statute should issue only where it is necessary and appropriate to secure a vindication of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.951" offset="6612532">This is not such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.098" offset="6621100">The Federal Courts here could not provide any protection to either the plaintiff or to any other potential plaintiffs that they could not otherwise receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.927" offset="6660493">Conversely, there may be many of the significant disadvantages described in Younger and Samuels of federal intrusion upon state criminal processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.286" offset="6693930">It is significant to the petitioner in this case has not sought any declaration of the Georgia Criminal Trespass Law is generally void or even in values to any class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.294" offset="6737920">Rarely, what it has sought is a only a declaration as to a particular incident, at a particular shopping center, at a particular time, seeking to convey a particular message.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.235" offset="6777731">The only declaration that the Federal Courts could issue in this case is that the conduct that occurred on October 8 or the different conduct that occurred on October 10 was violative of Federal Constitutional Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.773" offset="6827886">It could not have adjudicated the statute generally.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3181.010" offset="12800836">Thank you, Mr. Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.191" offset="12805538">Mr. Moore, you have few minutes left.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Moore, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3184.756" offset="12815778">Several things in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.686" offset="12831451">Indeed, as applied adjudications have less dignity than facial adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.873" offset="12864261">That is the facial constitutionality of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.355" offset="12878158">I think that for the reason that they do have less dignity that they should be rooted into the District Court where it is appropriate and the reason for that is that I believe it makes a more manageable relationship between the State or Federal Court and it unburdens this Court with needless applications for a certiorari which may be substantial questions in a Federal District Court but not necessarily substantial questions warranting to exercise by this Court’s certiorari -- jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.030" offset="13032908">I should say further that the District Courts are familiar with the exercise of the declaratory judgment action and apply the situations because they do it everyday in diversity cases where insurance companies are suing to determine whether or not a particular accident is within the coverage of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.190" offset="13121515">Why then should federal constitutional rights have any less dignity than ordinary personal injury of case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.710" offset="13151608">I think that as applied to adjudications are appropriate for rooting in to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.177" offset="13177417">That’s not necessarily a question to be decided in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.249" offset="13193718">Additionally, I think that the Court should take seriously the statement of Judge Tuttle with respect to turning federalism on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.605" offset="13247216">What would happen here if this Court were to affirm the Court of Appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.145" offset="13277309">It would create a situation where conduct could be controlled not by State Courts but rather by prosecutorial officials and law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.958" offset="13328614">The rule of (Inaudible) would really become a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.066" offset="13345019">Take for example in Steffel, instead of being an outside handbiller where a tenant in the shopping center, along head tenant in the shopping center operating an ice cream stand and instead of operating an ice cream everyday he had people to gather into his ice cream stand and plan protest against the war, ecological protest, support in behalf of women, racial rights, racial equality and takes that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.524" offset="13478870">But yet someone and the police did not like what Mr. Steffel were doing and told them that unless he seize they would arrest him for unlawful assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.415" offset="13522442">Without the right to come into Federal Court, Mr. Steffel may very well have to obey the admonishment of the state prosecutorial official.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.221" offset="13593600">He is a tenant and of course there would be greatest sensitivity and receptivity to his position because then he would also have a property right as well as a personal right of liberty but there is a tremendous danger that the Declaratory Judgment Act would be pro tanto repeal as Judge Tuttle indicated in his tremendous danger to federalism because valuable constitutional rights may be lost and there would be no remedy, no form in which they can be protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.157" offset="14081358">As I read 1983, in order for you to state a claim, you have to show that the defendant is in the language of statute subjects or causes to be subjected your client a deprivation of constitutional rights.</text>
