            <text syncTime="37.347" offset="226116">I felt that they justified some immediate answers from me because I have more personal knowledge of the case than he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.088" offset="257149">A question was raised as to what is a vexillologist.</text>

            <text syncTime="52.631" offset="287242">The particular gentleman who was involved in this case, Mr. Whitney Smith is the Secretary-General of the International Federation of Vexillology and he has written the definitive book on the subject of flags and their history.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.355" offset="534152">That is not what’s denoted by an official flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.598" offset="547109">The proportions however, the relation of the height to the width and the size in relative proportion of the stripes and the field with the stars go, are all regulated by a Federal Executive Order pursuant to statute, federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.582" offset="763089">Some statutes and some states refer only to representations.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.440" offset="994534">The pants were not, I can state from my own knowledge, manufactured that way but the record is silent as to whether he sewed them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.307" offset="1025985">And in fact, that’s something that I wish to bring up at a later time but now that you have mentioned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.198" offset="1049496">My brother has argued rather strenuously that this statute applies to the physical integrity, protecting the physical integrity of the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.714" offset="1083559">I think that making that argument really highlights the vagueness in this case because it seems to me, at least, that there is no possible justification for saying on the record in this case that this defendant affected the physical integrity of the flag by doing what he did which was merely displaying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.617" offset="1163180">If in fact you assume that he himself sewed it, there is a question as to whether he sewed it publicly.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.328" offset="1186064">There is no evidence of that which is also an element of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.059" offset="1201006">If we treat this as a continuing offense so that he’s sewing and then he’s displaying in some way constitutes a public sewing, even in that, by that stretch of the imagination, now the question of whether sewing something onto a larger piece of cloth, let’s say affects it’s physical integrity and is certainly, seriously open to question.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.522" offset="1442795">I believe it's page 25 of the appendix and in the brief we do refer to the testimony as saying that it did not conform to the official standards with this citation to the bill of exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.139" offset="1545300">Second question that was asked was whether there were any prosecutions in Massachusetts under the statue other than this one and my brother was not aware of any.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.767" offset="1583856">I’m personally aware of at least five.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.468" offset="1598589">I represented two other individuals who were prosecuted under the statute for displaying flags on various portions of their anatomy; a young woman who had her flag displayed on seat of her pants and a young man who had a flag displayed in a crouch area of his pants.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.074" offset="1673091">I further represented an individual who was charged with flag burning which is really distinguishable from this case and I am aware of a prosecution of an individual for displaying a flag upside down on a back of a jacket in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.266" offset="1733799">I am also aware of another flag burning prosecution in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.367" offset="1750204">So that this is by far not the only prosecution and they have actually been enough to raise some significance.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.496" offset="1818749">And of course, one of the issues here is whether someone who does what this respondent did should be sentenced to six months in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.405" offset="1862322">I mentioned this not merely to generate some sympathy for the respondent but also to point out that that in the area of First Amendment rights, there is the rubric of the chilling effect and certainly the widely publicized imprisonment or sentence in this case of six months is clearly a chilling effect to be had.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.964" offset="2028565">The girl who I represented who had a flag on the seat of her pants wrote an essay on what the flag means and received a lecture from the judge and had her case as a procedure in Massachusetts Court continuing without a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.143" offset="2105365">She had a case continued for six months without a finding and after that it was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.677" offset="2127412">The young man who was wearing a flag upside-down on his jacket was fined in the District Court and appealed that to Massachusetts Superior Court for jury trial and that case is still pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.688" offset="2195540">In one of the flag burning cases which as I say I think I am really not factually on point with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.728" offset="2231693">The defendant who was a high school student was sentenced to I think three months in the Massachusetts District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.286" offset="2261891">On appeal to the Superior Court, the Superior Court Judge agreed to continue her case without a finding provided that she would walk from Harvard Square, I think to downtown Boston carrying an American flag and she did that and that was how that case was disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.217" offset="2333571">So that some of these cases have been disposed off in non-criminal ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.194" offset="2361574">One case that I’m aware of, the District Court Judge which is the lowest court in Massachusetts ruled that the statute was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.281" offset="3485884">I think the analysis really begins with this Court’s decision in Broadrick.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.370" offset="3502184">In Broadrick which was discussing First Amendment standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.788" offset="3519948">The Court talked about how First Amendment protection becomes attenuated as the fact situation moves along that continuum from the spoken and printed word, to over a conduct which may be otherwise harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.976" offset="3584627">At one end of a spectrum, you’d have a speech and at the other end of the spectrum, you’d had a political assassination.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.438" offset="3610540">Both of which are arguable communicative, the speech is clearly protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.066" offset="3633006">The political assassination is clearly unprotected. We argue that the conduct in this case is so closely akin to pure speech under prior decisions of this Court and under the Broadrick analysis that you don’t apply symbolic speech test such as the O’Brien test here.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.964" offset="3708656">You apply a direct spoken word test and my precedent for that would be for example in the Stromberg case displaying a red flag and the Tinker case wearing a black armband, in the Barnette case refusing to salute the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.252" offset="3781799">All of those cases involved conduct which is otherwise totally harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.962" offset="3804578">In the words of Barnette, no rights of any other individuals were infringed upon by the conduct of the appellee and therefore this case should be treated strictly as a free speech case and not as the case involving symbolic speech or conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.358" offset="3874168">Even if you were to treat this as a symbolic speech case and apply the O’Brien test.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.624" offset="3895275">I would urge that this statute and the facts in this case both on their face and as applied to this appellee fail the O’Brien test miserably and one area of O’Brien test which was the track that I was on was the question of whether there is a legitimate state interest in protecting the physical integrity of the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.423" offset="3990465">I can think of but three state interests which you could postulate in protecting the physical integrity of the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.109" offset="4021185">One would be to protect against breaches of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.903" offset="4036336">Clearly this statute is not narrowly drawn enough to do that and secondly, it’s very clear that on the facts of this case, there was no breach of the peace eminent or otherwise.</text>
