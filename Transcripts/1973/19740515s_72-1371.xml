            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">The second case, which is Alexander versus Americans United, also involves the Anti-Injunction Act and issues similar, in many respects, to those in the case just announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.328" offset="146077">Here, the Internal Revenue Service revoked respondent’s ruling letter because of respondent’s lobbying activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.534" offset="178887">The effect of the revocation was to render respondent liable for Federal Unemployment taxes and also to terminate its eligibility for tax deductible contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.623" offset="235207">Respondent and two of its benefactors sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that the any lobbying provisions of the court were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.961" offset="284630">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the primary purpose of the suit was to raise constitutional issues rather than enjoin collection of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.120" offset="337189">We conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies even when constitutional issues are raised by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.213" offset="369580">We hold that the Act also is applicable even though the tax consequences affect primarily the donors rather than the organization holding the ruling letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.285" offset="425900">Accordingly, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.428" offset="442410">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion; Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the decision of the case.</text>
