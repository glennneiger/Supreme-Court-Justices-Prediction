            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ll hear arguments next in 72-885, William v. Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.753" offset="179722">Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="28.722" stopTime="540.183">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="28.722" offset="191634">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.179" offset="205427">This case presents at this stage is only an issue of federal taxpayer standing and the question is whether the exception made in the rule of Frothingham against Mellon by the later decision of Flast against Cohen should be widened to grandstanding in cases not involving the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise of clauses of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.388" offset="302289">The Government will attempt to demonstrate that an affirmative answer, the answer the respondent here seeks would effectively overrule all of Frothingham which Flast did not purport to do, and would probably destroy the concept of standing altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.909" offset="364356">That result we think is precluded by considerations rooted in Article III of the Constitution, and by considerations relating to the role of this Court and other federal courts in exercising the power of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.734" offset="427677">Respondent brought this suit in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to enjoin the publication by the Secretary of the Treasury of the combined statements of receipts, expenditures and balances of United States Government on the ground that, that document does not identify appropriations for and expenditures by the Central Intelligence Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.620" offset="527256">Now, this confidentiality of CIA funding, its spending is expressly provided by statute as an exception to the general statute which requires that the Secretary of the Treasury annually lay before Congress the combined statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.241" offset="597682">The CIA budget of course is reflected in the total figures in the combined statement, but it is not identified as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.807" offset="640000">Respondent’s theory is that this congressionally provided confidentiality violates the Statements and Accounts Clause of Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 which reads, “No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.977" offset="764656">The District Court dismissed respondent’s complaint on the ground that he lacks standing as a taxpayer, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit sitting en banc reversed with three judges dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.483" offset="830694">I would like to approach this case initially through an examination of Flast against Cohen in an attempt to show that, that case denies respondents standing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.841" offset="884088">And then I would like to turn briefly to issue of constitutional policy and argue that the standing concept in cases like this is in Article III concept as Flast against Cohen recognizes and it’s important to preserve that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.114" offset="949185">I think the majority opinion in Flast plainly denies standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.954" offset="968516">Only if the limits set by that case to taxpayer's standing are abandoned can respondent here be accorded standing and of course Flast must be seen against the background of Frothingham against Mellon.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.149" offset="1021388">In that case, in Frothingham, the taxpayer attacked the constitutionality of the Maternity Act of 1921 which setup a Federal program to grant -- make grants to States who would undertake programs to reduce maternal and infant mortality.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.762" offset="1091814">And the taxpayer sued and challenged the constitutionality of the Maternity Act on the grounds that it is exceeded the powers delegated to Congress under Article I, that it violated the powers reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment and that deprived her through the taxing process of her property without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.802" offset="1187944">Those are constitutional claims that at that time were certainly regarded as quite as important as any constitutional claim to respondents who seeks to litigate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.072" offset="1229009">But this Court nevertheless denied standing and that rule against taxpayers standing stood in violate until Flast.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.026" offset="1264849">The Flast majority was very careful to the state that it was reading the Frothingham rule intact except for the defined category of cases and the exception it made in the Frothingham rule was for cases in which the taxpayer could show a logical annexes between the taxpayers’ status and the claim he sought to adjudicate and that logical nexus test breaks down into two further tests in Flast.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.756" offset="1391804">First, there must be a logical link between the taxpayers’ status and the type of legislative enactment sought to be attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.005" offset="1428793">And second, there must be similar nexus between the test status of taxpayer and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.159" offset="1465365">I don’t think, pardon me, the respondent in this case can satisfy either of those tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.855" offset="1500160">The Flast opinion set up this first nexus, the one between the status of taxpayer and the enactment to this challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.697" offset="1535582">I quote a taxpayer would be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality, only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Article I, Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.355" offset="1586155">The respondent here of course is not attacking any exercise of the taxing and spending power under Article -- under Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.191" offset="1625548">He is attacking a reporting provision under Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.052" offset="1644983">The Court in Flast continued, “It will not be sufficient for a taxpayer to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="405.952" offset="1700571">Now I would like to make two observations about that first test in connection with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.391" offset="1722305">The first is that here the respondent makes no complaint of any injury to his pocket book.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.914" offset="1752398">He is not saying that any tax money is being taken from him in violation of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.214" offset="1777580">So that there is no link between the status he asserts, that of a taxpayer and the statute permitting CIA funding to be placed in the budgets of other agencies or departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.727" offset="1835677">It’s apparent on the face of the matter that what he has is the interest common to all citizens, that is as this Court has put it, merely a general interest common to all members of the public and that he seeks to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of Government and those are precisely the phrases of this Court has used to describe a litigant who has no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.011" offset="1948839">The second observation I would like to make about this first test in Flast is that the theory of the majority of the Court of Appeals below and I believe the theory of the respondent here is that the first Flast test is satisfied because the respondent is injured by lack of knowledge about the CIA budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.597" offset="2043089">As the respondent’s brief puts it, it is the intimacy of the constitutional provision to the spending process that is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.434" offset="2086452">If that were the test, then Flast actually left no vestiture to Frothingham despite its protestations to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.410" offset="2126367">Taxpayers would have I think, under that test, standing to litigate any grievance that is colorably related to the appropriation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.149" offset="2169313">And that in turn would inject the courts into every imaginable question bearing on the constitutionality of actions by the legislative and executive branches at the request of every disgruntled taxpayer, who wanted to oppose some governmental program or procedure.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="646.992" offset="2664699">The second Flast test is of course the question of whether the taxpayer has stated a relationship and nexus between themselves and the constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.987" offset="2696673">And as our position is you just suggested, it might be Mr. Chief Justice, that in fact this provision is designed toward the protection of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.462" offset="2738573">It's designed to give Congress control over executive spending to find out what the Executive is spending and what the Executive is receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.868" offset="2780264">I think that’s apparent both from the history of the statute although the history is not free from ambiguity in all candor, but I think is even more apparent from the necessary construction of this clause in connection with other clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.406" offset="2858423">In the history, the history is set forth in our brief, the opposition of George Mason and Patrick Henry to this clause of the constitution was apparently founded upon the fact that it might allow secrecy and expend some accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.243" offset="2945672">In addition to that in a phrase which is perhaps not entirely free from bad ambiguity, but I think it supports the Government’s position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.791" offset="2979944">In the debate in the constitutional convention on this clause in September 14 which is reported in 2 Farrand's records at page 619.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.342" offset="3014113">James Wilson of Pennsylvania supported the motion to change the provision before them from an accounting year-by-year in annual accounting to an accounting from time-to-time which is the present language in the clause, by saying that many operations of finance cannot be properly published at certain times.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.773" offset="3099794">But I think we rely unless upon that history which I think is incomplete than we do upon two other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.629" offset="3143262">One is, but after that history it became regular practice for the Congress to keep some appropriations secret when the occasion of the national interest seem to demand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.244" offset="3201776">Our brief at page 26 points to the fact that there was secret appropriation in 1811 to $100,000.00 I believe for the occupation of Spanish Florida an Act by the Congress which obviously had a great deal of sensitivity in Foreign Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.871" offset="3276278">That appropriation was kept secret for seven years until 1818 when it was published and of course the most famous example of this kind of procedure was the $2 billion secretly spent to develop the atom bomb in the Manhattan project during World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.220" offset="3345659">So I think there is a course to the historic practice which supports the idea that this is -- the reporting is in the control of Congress and its intended to give Congress control over what the Executive is doing with funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.191" offset="4057548">Now, the respondent’s brief attempts to find the negative pregnant in the fact that the constitution explicitly authorizes in Article I, Section 5, Clause 3, each house to keep secret its debates and decisions on matters that it believes require secrecy and respondent argues that see they knew how to provide for secrecy when it was called for and the fact that they did not provide for it in the Statement and Accounts Clause, explicitly means that it doesn’t exist, power of confidentiality does not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.588" offset="4507063">Obviously, the matter is sensitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.510" offset="4514795">The appropriation’s committees of both the House and the Senate have sub-committees to which the CIA budget and expenditures are reported and from time-to-time in the Senate there is joint membership between the Armed Services Committee and the Budget Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.094" offset="4577176">So there is a congressional check on this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.272" offset="4589819">It is just that it is deemed wise I suppose that matters of this sensitivity not be given to bodies of the size of the full House and the full Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.253" offset="4673724">I think then it is fairly plain I think that the respondents claim the standing as a taxpayer doesn’t meet either first or the second Flast test requiring a logical nexus between his status and enactment and his status in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.155" offset="4761391">When you think about -- when I think about his claim to standing here, it seems to me that he'd be indistinguishable from the claim to standing made in Ex parte Levitt where a citizen and a member the bar of this Court filed a motion requiring, asking that Mr. Justice Black be required to show cause why he should not be disqualified to be a member of this Court because of Article I, Section 6, Clause 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.540" offset="4878942">And the Court thought so little of that claim that they dismissed with per curiam opinion saying that they did not sit to discuss generalized grievances about the way the Government is operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.765" offset="4943830">I think this case is also indistinguishable from Laird against Tatum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.437" offset="4966504">That was a case in which there was a citizen interest in the possible chilling effect in Army Intelligence System though there was no direct impact upon the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.035" offset="5008927">And they were denied standing, the case is already standing case that cites Ex Parte Levitt for its main holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.826" offset="5048007">I would think that citizens in general would have as much interest in the possible and alleged chilling effect from an Army Surveillance System upon First Amendment values as citizen if in general would have here upon the reporting of the CIA budget.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="1282.856" offset="5208189">So I think the Laird v. Tatum is also a direct holding and a more recent one, Laird than Ex parte Levitt, that there is no standing in this case, I think I should say why I think it’s important, why I think standing is much more than a rule of judicial self-restraint or discretionary rule as the respondent’s brief puts it and as some of the cases put it, I think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.685" offset="5307455">We can see what the standing here is in Article III doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.222" offset="5317590">It's a doctrine relates fundamentally to the way that this Court and the lower federal courts (Inaudible) in judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.715" offset="5355624">It is usually said that standing isn’t an issue of whether the party is a proper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.096" offset="5381120">Whereas justiciability is an issue, it's a question of whether the issue was one that’s suitable for a court to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.712" offset="5411631">I think that it is not put it quite accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.861" offset="5428140">I think standing is a branch of justiciability because it goes -- it examines the party only to discover whether he is a party who will put the issue in the forum, in a forum which is suitable for judicial resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.155" offset="5497417">And that makes it I think an aspect or a subdivision of justiciability and I think the Flast opinion agrees that indeed it is an aspect of justiciability, it is an Article III doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.798" offset="5559902">It has also said that the doctrine one having to do with whether the issue will be presented by sufficient adverseness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.430" offset="5590518">I suppose extending standing to all citizens might require -- might result in the decline in the vigor of adversary presentation in some cases, it is also necessary to admit that it will not in many because citizen standing will be used often by persons with ideological interests or groups with ideological interests who will press the case with great vigor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.939" offset="5684454">So, I am not so sure that the decline in vigor presentation is a general problem, although it maybe in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.257" offset="5717786">What standing and the requirement of an injury in fact actually does is delay the presentation of the issue to the Court until the law challenged has some actual impact upon members of the society and I think that’s important for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.248" offset="5789780">One is that we ought to examine cases, the courts ought to examine cases in concrete factual settings because our constitutional law too is law that has a common law tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.325" offset="5826038">A common law of jurisprudence and we like to concrete factual settings because they qualify the rules announced in the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.014" offset="5864803">They explained the meanings of the rule to people who must read the cases and they help the Court in imagining the difficulties they can get into with a particular rule because it is presented with factual situations that indicate the complexities that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.516" offset="5930841">So the standing issue aside from being -- it is also has an aspect of fairness to parties who maybe interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.932" offset="5956441">That is a party may have a specific injury done to him and a rule of citizen or taxpayer standing might result in somebody who does not have such interests or a factual setting getting to the courts first with this case and perhaps resulting in a rule that would not have been arrived or not arrived at in precisely that form, had a person with a real person's stake had been in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.291" offset="6061871">But primary, I think the concept is important as a rule of fairness to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.721" offset="6091651">I think not just fairness to the court, but the ability of the court to perform the awesome function of judicial review with maximum effectiveness sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.820" offset="6148075">Where there is citizen standing and taxpayer standing, generally, is quite plain I think that we would have an increased number of groups and persons who would attack the statutes the moment they were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.569" offset="6199066">Who would attack Executive programs the moment they were announced and having standing, they would find themselves in court debating abstract theorems instantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.706" offset="6255595">There are two things wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.891" offset="6260297">I have already discussed I think what’s wrong with that in terms of the fact that the issues are not quite well without a concrete factual setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.807" offset="6300003">But there’s also something wrong with ideological litigation in that lawyers in such litigation often do not explore the issues fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.953" offset="6340545">They are looking for a sweeping constitutional result and are likely not to explore narrow or statutory or factual problems that maybe quite important to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.410" offset="6382341">Whereas a person with a personal stake wants to win the case and will explore every ground upon which he might win that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.560" offset="6435004">This kind of standing which would come immediately after a law has passed or statute or executive action announced means that the court at the behest of such a litigant and ideological litigant does not want to explore all the concrete settings, in fact there is no concrete setting, would in effect repeat the legislative or executive decision making process that had just concluded and would probably repeat it with fewer materials than were available to the legislature and to the executive in arriving at the decision, I don’t think that, that is the court’s test in the system of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.513" offset="6582753">It makes the court into something like the counsel of revision, the framers rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.017" offset="6604800">It puts the court in something of the position of giving advisory opinions and I think that would be most unfortunate for the function of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.630" offset="11459291">No one would have any special standing here than this plaintiff and this Court has on a number of occasions stated that standing can arise because of the circumstance that no one else could raise the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.521" offset="11554795">For instance, in the Rhode Island so called censorship case, this Court expressly said that the booksellers there who were not directly affected had standing because otherwise the basic issues of freedom of speech involved might never be presented to the Court and of course the same was true in NAACP against Alabama and in Barrows where the question arose as to the impact of a restricted covenant whether a white person could raise the issue that such a covenant discriminated against Negroes.</text>
