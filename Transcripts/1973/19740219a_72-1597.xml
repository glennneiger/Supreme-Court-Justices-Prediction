            <label>Mr. Larry L. Eubanks</label>
            <text syncTime="38.535" offset="230922">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.469" offset="242625">This matter comes on to be heard here on the writ of certiorari from the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.016" offset="268852">Simply, it involves our right-to-work law in the relationship with that right-to-work law with the Federal Substantive and the Federal National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.117" offset="313260">A factual situation is one where three individuals who were employed at some food stores in North Carolina were terminated right after a union election that was conducted by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.963" offset="364565">Now, our right-to-work law provides simply that in North Carolina a person who has a right to live, has a right to work there but after the union won the election, these three individuals was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.317" offset="438021">And it’s our position simply that there is a coexistence as possible between a right-to-work law in the State of North Carolina that protects supervisors and a federal law which protects employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.342" offset="494132">Now, the case is dealing with the right of people that belong to unions and whether or not there is a constitutional right for that approach, have been dealt with many times by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.316" offset="550034">First of all in the Morton case back in 1940 -- Tomas v. Collins in 1945, the Court stated that “Union membership is protected by the right of association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="135.811" offset="620042">Well what that meant as it had been interpreted later was as true so long as you know government interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.568" offset="647001">In other words, government interference came in if you have the right to association.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.046" offset="664973">And that gave rise to a lot of cases involving people excluded from coverage on the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.813" offset="692036">For example teachers, policeman, garbage workers and a lot of cases they have extended all up into the present day time.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.811" offset="731951">Well, it's our position simply that in North Carolina as in about 19 to 20 other states, we have a law that says one of the group of people and that is supervisors have a right to belong to a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.815" offset="792033">That does not say nor does our law say that a company or an employer is required to bargain within the union of any body because that’s been covered by the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.220" offset="841665">There is no credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.716" offset="843651">It simply provides that everybody in North Carolina has a right to belong to a union without fear of being fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.497" offset="882730">Now, if in fact this case is preempted or the state law is preempted by federal law and I would agree with the defendant and the respondent in this case that the state courts have no business dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.520" offset="946782">But it is really our position that this Court in 1967, in the Hanna case has already answered this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.605" offset="983144">We submit that the Hanna case in Section 14 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act really determines and answers the question whether or not a supervisor can join a union and damages for his discharge because of his union membership can be given in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.599" offset="1055138">And that’s the question we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.515" offset="1066841">In the Hanna case, the Court dealt with Section 14 (a) and I would like for the Court if I might to point out all of the words of 14 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act and it reads this way and I quote “Nothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="269.325" offset="1154090">But the second phrase of that same Section is what the Court exactly dealt within Hanna Mining company that such statement says, “But no employer subject to this Act shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining.”</text>
            <text syncTime="294.671" offset="1255445">Now the point I’m making by reading this to the Court is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.803" offset="1271954">First of all Congress says when it removes supervisors from the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1947 by the Taft-Hartley Amendment, supervisors can still belong to union but no longer will employers be required to bargain collectively with unions made up wholly or partially a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.012" offset="1356800">Now, if that approach is maintained under the federal scheme presently, it is our position that there is no conflict with our right-to-work law and a protection of a supervisor and the federal scheme or the federal law is passed in Section 14 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="338.488" offset="1430674">And this is one, in 1964 in the Morton case, this Court dealt with federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.833" offset="1476127">The Court has dealt it many times and I am referring to case as generally cited in our brief.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="353.618" offset="1491174">We’ll resume there at 1 o’clock counsel.[Noon Recess]</text>
            <text syncTime="369.079" offset="1553032">Mr. Eubanks you may continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.145" offset="1561287">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.974" offset="1568601">Thank you very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.346" offset="1574139">You recall just before the luncheon recess I quoted to you a quotation from the case called Tomas v. Collins which provides “Union membership is protected by the right of association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="387.798" offset="1627951">That was the 1945 case and that was in that posture of the situation that Congress chose to amend the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.783" offset="1655850">It was then called the Taft-Hartley Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.538" offset="1670896">Now, I think it’s reasonable for the Court and we submit to the Court if reasonable for us to assume that Congress when it included 14 (a) into the Act, it had some reason for all of the words it put in that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.069" offset="1716976">You recall what I read to you just before the recess also Section 14 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="415.651" offset="1739337">The only time, I confine the case in which the Court had the actual situation where 14 (a) was an issue is the case called Hanna Mining which occurred in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.451" offset="1790537">In that case, the Court talks about the Garmon decision, a 1959 decision to this Court which I’m sure the Court deals with often in preemption setting out in effect that conduct which is protected or by Section 7 or prohibited by Section 8 that the National Labor Relations Act is certainly preempted from any state control.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.151" offset="1877368">But in that case and then the Hanna case mentions that there may be some other areas in which it may be better that state regulation not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.762" offset="1915820">Now, I would like to point out that one quote from Hanna Mining which raised that “The grand rules for preemption in the labor law emerging from our Garmon decision that the case that is mentioned should first be briefed or summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.118" offset="1981231">In general a state may not regulate conduct arguably protected by Section 7 or prohibited by Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="485.886" offset="2020310">Well, that’s clear and it’s been clear now since the Garmon decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.080" offset="2045074">In Hanna Mining, the Court goes on to point out “The legislative purpose may further dictate that certain activity, neither protected nor prohibited be deemed privilege against state regulation and continuing for the reasons that follow, we believe the Board’s decision that Hanna Engineers are supervisors removed from this case most of the opportunity for preemption.”</text>
            <text syncTime="521.174" offset="2161476">Now it is right there if the Court please that the appellant plaintiff in this case rests its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.557" offset="2198988">In the Hanna case, the Court dealt with a situation where some supervisory engineers were attempting to picket, to obtain a recognition from an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.557" offset="2251024">The employer really in that case just said, “Well, I don’t believe you represent a true majority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="548.131" offset="2269309">It did not take really the position that was ended up to start with but in that situation the Hanna engineers were doing exactly what the last part of Section 14 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act says says “it cannot do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="565.273" offset="2337855">In other words that it cannot, no employer said that this Act shall be compelled to treat supervisors as employees for the purpose of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.669" offset="2379442">And the Hanna Engineers were simply trying to get this employer to do exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.238" offset="2401698">Well, in the Hanna case, the Court mentions that it’s not dealing in that case with the situation where a person could become a supervisor and be fired for being a union member.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.475" offset="2454674">It says it’s not -- specifically not dealing with that situation and this Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.658" offset="2467422">Well, the situation we have before this Court right now is the one the Court in Hanna said it wasn't going to deal within that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.740" offset="2499709">In 1967, a case called U.S. versus Morton before this Court pointed out that -- or Teamster Local versus Morton, this is in 377 U.S., in dealing with the question of preemption 1964, I’m sorry, it says to explain the preemption doctrine further “The answer to that question ultimately depends upon whether the application of state law in this kind of case would operate to frustrate the purpose of the federal legislation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="639.020" offset="2632829">Now, we submit to the Court that in light of Hanna, the Hanna case and in light of the statement in the Morton case explaining what is and what isn’t preempted that the activity of these three individuals who signed membership cards to the Union and were fired as a result thereof is not the kind of activity if regulated by the states would frustrate the National Labor Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.496" offset="2730736">In the --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="664.600" offset="2735125">Did the state court have any -- did the state court identify any particular provision that the state law was in conflict with?</text>

            <label>Mr. Larry L. Eubanks</label>
            <text syncTime="675.426" offset="2778488">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.527" offset="2782877">In this -- in the North Carolina Supreme Court case, the Court simply ruled in that decision that this matter is preempted by Federal Law and that was the basis of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.622" offset="2831256">The Court of Appeals it rose specifically in citing Hanna and other decisions that he had not been preempted and the Supreme Court would reverse but it relied primarily on Hanna Mining in reversing the court’s decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.982" offset="2880679">Now I submit to the Court that Hanna Mining simply says, “Here is a state court trying to enjoin conduct being engaged in by some supervisors” which the National Labor Relations Act says “cannot be done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="715.750" offset="2939716">The employer is not required to countenance, this kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.688" offset="2955494">And therefore when the state court attempted to enjoin it, this Court said that’s okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.262" offset="2977750">You can enjoin that kind of conduct because it does not in that kind of application of state law frustrate the National Labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.683" offset="3011500">Well, we are asking the Court in this instance simply to rule, if Congress meant anything when it put the first part of the sentence of 14 (a) in there “Nothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization” to treat the first half of that sentence the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.566" offset="3091017">Meaning in effect if people have a right to belong to a union as Congress has said, then how can the provision for damages in a state court which only comes into play if this people are not allowed to exercise that right frustrate a National Labor Policy?</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.637" offset="4263288">Well, Your Honor that’s what the State Court as I understood it said Your Honor and that’s why I so vehemently disagree with because even if you will come into the case called (Inaudible) which I believe -- and it involved one of these situations where a supervisor was fired because he was told to go out and engage in some unlawful conduct on part of his employer and he said, “I am not going to do it” and the employer said “Well, if you don’t do it I will fire you,” and he wouldn’t do it so he got fired and the case went up through the board and it was ended up to the situation that the board ruled and was supported by enforcement that that really coerced employees who were covered by the Act and by firing a supervisor who was being in an effort to coerce employees we feel that situation is covered by 8 (a) 1 of the Act and I agree fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.486" offset="4450743">But in so -- if the employer sits and contends to this Court and us and through all the Courts that have gone before that, look, an employer should have an absolute right to fire a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.912" offset="4504346">And that’s what I want to address this remark to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.895" offset="4516362">Now, I remember in the North Carolina Supreme Court, one of the justices asked me and the question, “look, this means that anybody can be a union member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.055" offset="4557009">This even means that a manger could be a union member.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.362" offset="4570175">Well I submit to the Court, they can be and it doesn’t mean that disloyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.273" offset="4589819">Somebody is so calm and in our every day life that people who grew up to the ranks of a union, a local union somewhere in the south or wherever it might be and accumulate benefits through membership and he is promoting in the supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.550" offset="4650945">He keeps his membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.870" offset="4660245">The ruling of this Court that people are fired simply because they are union member, not for participation in any conduct disloyal to an employer, but simply by being something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.812" offset="4695980">By belonging to something would in effect mean that the employer could go out and fire everybody that was a member of a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.084" offset="4729104">That’s what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.481" offset="4734642">Now in a teacher situation, in a teacher situation where these teachers attempted to organize in the North Carolina area for example, this case came up as to whether or not they had the right to organize and under the First Amendment of course if the state said no or the county as this case might be, would be protected under First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.784" offset="4819905">But I point out to the Court respectfully that to be a union member is not what 14 (a) is to protect against and there is no way it could frustrate federal labor policy for an employee or person who has got a right to work and arise a part of his right to live, go take a job or signing union card and in the end not getting fired when the law -- when the federal labor law has already said it but Congress said that we could do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.492" offset="4930664">Well but your example of the ordinary employee is the easy case because there, the federal law protects that right and obviously it wouldn’t get this far with that kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.038" offset="4976849">But then it makes your problem more difficult if the man is a supervisor and so you do have to address the supervisor on 14 (a) which doesn’t affect ordinary employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.362" offset="5018227">You got to -- one thing I point out to the Court, the Court had a case that I find interesting as it relates to this situation and it was this, this case called U.S. versus Robel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.613" offset="5059187">And I am sure the Court is familiar where it dealt with the question of a communist who had applied for a job with the Defense Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.995" offset="5096699">And the Defense Department had a regulation or some policy or for some reason he was not hired on the ground that his interest where inimical to that of this country because he was an admitting communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.933" offset="5144451">Well, there the Court pointed out and I’d like to quote that if I might to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.859" offset="5164199">The Court said this that “The operative fact upon which the job disability depends is the exercise of an individual’s right of association which is protected by the provisions of the First Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.356" offset="5242149">Now I point that out for this reason, I submit to the Court that if Congress did not mean in its enactment of 14 (a) that people should be entitled even if they are a supervisor to continue to be able to join a union and it didn’t have that right. Surely Congress in the status of the law in 1947 would have been more explicit in the provisions of 14 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.780" offset="5335876">They don’t talk about membership only in 14 (a), they talk about membership and then they talk about collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.112" offset="5365238">I submit when they talked about membership, it said in effect that if supervisors can join but I further submit if the supervisors do bond together and try enforcing their employer to recognize them, that’s against the law and 14 (a) doesn’t protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.166" offset="5421453">But unless an employer -- a supervisor is disloyal to his employer and the employer learns of that disloyalty in more respect than to see him joining an organization, he is certainly entitled to some protection in the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.105" offset="11209143">For example, in this particular case, the employer would be subject to the federal law as to employees, the state law as to supervisors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.296" offset="11453962">Hanna Mining through that Court of Appeals are because they took the position that supervisors where involved so Hanna Mining says no preemption of the state so that’s what we hope, Hanna Mining did not hope well as I attempted to explain a few minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.063" offset="11537032">Our position is if it please the Court that under the federal statutes, under the underlying purpose of a uniform approach, federal labor policy under the cases on preemption of this Court that the Supreme Court of North Carolina is correct and that the state is preempted from applying this particular statute as to supervisors in a state court damage action.</text>
