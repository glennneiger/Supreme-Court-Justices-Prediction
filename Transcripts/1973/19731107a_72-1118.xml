            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="33.638" offset="212302">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.196" offset="226513">This is a direct appeal from a judgment of a Three-Judge District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, holding unconstitutional, certain provisions of the Lloyd-La Follette Act governing the discipline primarily for discharge of non-probationary federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.788" offset="312926">The case brings before the Court two constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.872" offset="329226">One, relating to the procedures followed in terminating such employees and the other relating to the validity of the standards for their termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.502" offset="371754">Under the statute and the implementing regulations of the Civil Service Commission, a non-probationary federal employee may be removed from office after being given a written statement of the charges, an opportunity to reply in writing or orally and to submit affidavits and the receipt of a written decision by the officer effecting the termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.754" offset="476766">The statute however explicitly provides that a hearing prior to termination is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.427" offset="507486">Under the Civil Service Commission Regulations however, the employee following such termination has the right to a hearing even before the agency or before the Civil Service Commission and the first question presented is whether this statutory practice which in effect defers the evidentiary hearing to an appeal following the termination satisfies the Due Process Standards of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.015" offset="613857">The statute itself provides that a federal employee may be removed only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.130" offset="658265">Again, the Civil Service Commission has implemented this rather general standard through some regulations which I will come to shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.046" offset="694000">The substantive question in the case is whether is a violation of the First Amendment when this provision is applied to terminate the service of a non-probationary government employee because of statements he has made, public statements accusing his superiors of misfeasance and criminal activity and which in the judgment of his superiors effectively undermines the ability of the agency to performs its services.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.595" offset="816149">Now the Court in this case invalidated the statute on its face on the basis of granting summary judgment for the appellees and under civil practices, the validity of that action maybe just be tested on the basis of the facts most strongly supporting the government and accordingly, I shall state the facts of this case on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.101" offset="902144">Mr. Friedman, I read through the record in the case that the appendix and I noticed that government supplied a number of affidavits and the like in connection with its motion to dismiss.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.187" offset="958568">And now looking through the docket entries in the District Court, it was not clear to me since there are none included in the appendix whether that government had those same affidavits carry over for consideration on the motion for summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.077" offset="1022098">I would assume Mr. Justice they were before the Court on the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.903" offset="1041429">But summary judgment was granted against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.367" offset="1051251">Summary judgment was granted against us and it seems to me that in considering the propriety of that action, we can properly look to the evidence that would support our case, not the evidence that would support their case.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.298" offset="1099003">But it would have to have been evidence that was before the court had said?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="258.765" offset="1112795">Oh, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.394" offset="1115303">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.988" offset="1117706">But the evidence before the Court included much of the material that was the basis for the discharge of Mr. Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.300" offset="1150934">Now, I would like to say one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.225" offset="1158666">In their brief, the appellees at pages 2 and 3 have stated that much of what the government has set forth as its statement of the case is not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.795" offset="1204955">We disagree with that and accordingly in my presentation, whenever we get to any controverted materials, I will give record references to the appendix which support the statements I am making.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.128" offset="1254275">The Appellee, Mr. Kennedy at the time of these events was a field representative in the Chicago Office of the Office of Economic Opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.901" offset="1301400">He was a fairly important man there.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.818" offset="1312998">He had a government grade of GS-12 which is in the intermediate range and paid at that time $16,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.279" offset="1346853">As explained in the instructions that OEO puts out to its field representatives which are quoted in the record in the affidavit of the Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.909" offset="1393455">The field representative was a particularly crucial person in the operation of OEO.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.883" offset="1417279">OEO of course, its basic function is to channel funds to various community groups to enable them to improve their life economically.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.883" offset="1453328">And his job was to have contact with the community action groups to talk with them, to explain to the community action groups what OEO is doing, what its policies were and to be sure that these policies were being carried out in the implementation of the programs by the community action groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.194" offset="1538591">As OEO stated itself, this man as a practical matter was viewed by the community groups as OEO.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.679" offset="1576521">His job as I said was to explain these policy decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.612" offset="1588224">That material is set forth at pages 24 and 25 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.044" offset="1609958">And Mr. Kennedy has twice been subjected to disciplinary action in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.877" offset="1637230">In the first instance in November of 1971, he was charged by the Regional Director with various acts of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.808" offset="1668995">He replied in writing a lengthy reply which is not included in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.898" offset="1689370">He had an oral presentation before the Regional Director and following this in January 1972, the Regional Director concluded that only one of the several charges made against him was sustained by the evidence, and instead of terminating his services as he had originally proposed, instead, he suspended him the 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.829" offset="1777037">I just mentioned in passing because I think, this is an indication of what is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.658" offset="1800443">The appellees say that this was outrageous because he was suspended for 60 days on the basis of a single telephone conversation that took place 11 months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.974" offset="1841716">Well, the reason for the 11 months before is that the charges against him which led to this suspension covered a period of almost a year and this was the only one of the charges that was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.876" offset="1885288">But the single telephone conversation was a phone conversation he made to officials of one these community action groups in which he told them they should get rid of the existing Board of Directors and get themselves a new Board of Directors which they could control.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.773" offset="1952893">He did this inspite of the fact that there were specific instructions from OEO set forth at pages 38 to 40 of the appendix that field representatives were to keep their hands off the internal operations of these community action groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.513" offset="2023842">There were allowed then to make their own decisions even though they seemed wrong to maintain an arms-length posture, and even though he had previously been warned against such activities when he had a previous situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.421" offset="2075460">I just may say one thing well, I think this illustrates very dramatically the kind of disrupted effect this sort of conduct would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.385" offset="2103359">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.181" offset="2202520">This was served upon him in February 1972 approximately three weeks after his previous notice of his suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.994" offset="2241703">Basically, these charges related to two different activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.303" offset="2258944">One, related to certain statements he made with relation to a problem had arisen in Chicago relating to the Indians in Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.009" offset="2393840">Well, I think it is relevant to this extent Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.632" offset="2416306">One of the claims here is that a hearing was required in advance of termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.320" offset="2447026">Under the statutory provisions, this man is given an opportunity as told what the charges are against him has the opportunity to respond both orally and in writing and to submit affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.862" offset="2501256">And then if he is discharged, he has a right to full hearing with the complete panoply of procedures after that discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.217" offset="2530617">In this case, he was given rather very specific charges of certain improprieties and he did not submit any material at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.181" offset="2570533">So to that extent, we think the facts are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.777" offset="2580877">In addition, it seems to me that these facts are quite significant in evaluating his claim that the statute is unconstitutional as an infringement of his First Amendment Rights because our basic position on that is that a conscientious government employee could really have not doubt that the kind of things he is alleged to have done would be detrimental to the efficiency of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.727" offset="2672724">Now, that’s the reason I am stressing these facts because I think the case has to be brought into a proper postures.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.049" offset="3033945">First of all, he said that the Regional Director and his Executive Assistant had either bribed or tempted to bribe one of the leaders of the Indian Community in Chicago by offering this man a grant of $100,000.00, if this man in turn would make a statement, give a written statement against Mr. Kennedy and another employee who was active in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.438" offset="3147525">He made this charge at a union meeting, and this charge was repeated in a newspaper report of the meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.460" offset="3187649">This is true according to the -- no, no, I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.832" offset="3205099">He claimed it’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.801" offset="3212936">The Regional Director found it was not true, found it was not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.173" offset="3226415">Now, in addition to that, he conducted a press conference in the lobby of the building where OEO.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.777" offset="3252851">As he conducted it into the lobby because he had been refused permission after his suspension to hold a press conference in the OEO Offices where he wanted and he got handed out a press release and set forth at pages 44 and 45 of the record in which he accused the Regional Director of breaking treaties with the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.025" offset="3337906">It was a newspaper story covering that.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.594" offset="3348146">In addition to that, he made an accusation against an OEO Official that they had violated the OEO conflict of interest standards by entering into an insurance contract with a company with which the husband of this woman was connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.415" offset="3419408">Now, as I have indicated, he was told, he was told in this notice of charges that he could submit either written answers with affidavits and an oral hearing, he did neither, all he did was file an answer which is set forth at page 62 of the record in which he said he wanted a hearing before an impartial Hearing Officer and he said that applying this statute to punish him, to discharge him on the basis of statements, speech he had made violated his rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.422" offset="3555453">Following the receipt of this, he did not submit anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.378" offset="3571336">Further than that, the Regional Director informed Mr. Kennedy in writing that the charges against was sustained, directed his removal and informed Mr. Kennedy that he had the right to appeal that either to the agency, within the agency itself or to the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.814" offset="3637060">He elected to appeal to the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.058" offset="3650017">I just like briefly to refer to the affidavit of the Regional Director submitted in the District Court in opposition to their motion for a stay which would have the effect of putting Mr. Kennedy -- keeping Mr. Kennedy at work and he explained in considerable detail what had led to Mr. Kennedy’s discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.636" offset="3740296">And that at the end of bottom of page 32 and the top of page 33, after first pointing out that he recognized the importance of free and open discussion within the agency, and he also recognized the importance of constructive criticism within the agency but he said however, when the criticisms take the form of malicious personal attacks made publicly by a field representative who is viewed as OEO by the community at large, when the criticism result in a breakdown and the necessary maintenance of discipline produced serious disharmony among co-workers and loss of morale and destroy ongoing efforts of this office to serve the poor and the disadvantaged then the efficiency of government has dealt a severe blow.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.500" offset="3935796">He also pointed out at the top of the page that prior to the issuance of Mr. Kennedy’s press release, the office had been attempting to put together a coalition among the Indians of Chicago that would create an organization that was able to receive and handle a substantial grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.075" offset="4002043">But after his, Mr. Kennedy’s attack on OEO as he put it the coalition fell apart and as of the time of filing of the affidavit, he stated that had not been able to put together another coalition and process the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.499" offset="4059721">In the District Court as I have indicated, the Court first held that the statute was a violation of Procedural Due Process because of its failure under the statute and the procedures to give Mr. Kennedy an adversary full hearing before his termination and on the basis of that conclusion directed the Mr. Kennedy be reinstated and he has been reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.173" offset="4146448">The Court also said that although he had recognized that the conduct of the speech which was the basis for Mr. Kennedy’s discharge did provide a basis for disciplinary action, nevertheless, the statute it held was unconstitutional on its face because it said this vague language is likely to have a chilling effect upon other employees in the exercise of their First Amendment rights and it enjoined the enforcement of the statute in the regulations and this is the language from 7 (a) of our jurisdictional statement of the opinion insofar as they have construed to regulate the speech of competitive service employees, a very broad injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.829" offset="4329096">Now, coming to the merits of the case the statutory argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.707" offset="4344560">First, as with respect to the Procedural Due Process issue, the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912 was enacted to provide substantial protections for federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.313" offset="4399000">Prior to that time, federal employees had virtually no job protection at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.807" offset="4416972">They were subject almost to dismissal at the whim or the caprice of their superiors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.696" offset="4440586">And what Congress did in the Lloyd-La Follette Act which is keep provisions of which in that present form is set forth at page 37 of the brief was to do two-three things -- really two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.486" offset="4487711">The first was it provides in the first sentence that an individual in the competitive service may be removed or suspended without pay only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.267" offset="4534836">For the first time wrote into law a job protection for federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.458" offset="4551555">They could only be dismissed for cause and only such cause would promote the efficiency of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.342" offset="4575169">Then it provided certain procedural protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.749" offset="4584782">The employee was to get notice of the charges, had a reasonable time to file a written answer to the charges and affidavits, and was entitled for a written decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.123" offset="4622294">And then it goes on to say examination of witnesses, trial or hearing is not required but may be provided in the discretion of the individual directing the removal or suspension without pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.875" offset="4677256">And what Congress has done is to leave it to the individual agency to decide whether or not in following its discharge procedures it gives the man a hearing prior to his termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.047" offset="4733994">At the present time, eight agencies do provide for such pre-termination hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.097" offset="4762206">They employ approximately 10% of the federal workforce but the statistics that we have from the Civil Service Commission indicate that's a much smaller percentage of disciplinary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.822" offset="4805047">A vast bulk of government agencies in number covering the vast bulk of federal employees do not provide for any pre-discharge hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.105" offset="4846216">What they do provide for is the and under the regulations of the Civil Service Commission, a 30-day notice of charges, full statement of the charges, an opportunity either to reply in writing or orally to submit affidavits, the opportunity of the man to examine the Civil Service files containing the information in which the charges are based and an opportunity in a written report.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.728" offset="4968678">But, after if he is discharged, he has a full hearing with a complete right to confront all the witnesses, a transcript was taken to produced his own witness, superiored by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.192" offset="5010578">And if that was the result of that hearing which is I have indicated maybe either before the agency of the Civil Service Commission, if as a result of that hearing, he is ordered reinstated, if his discharged is set aside, he gets full backpay under the statute for the period he was out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.186" offset="5078497">Now, this Court has recognized over the years and most recently in the Cafeteria Workers case that without legislation unless there is some specific legislative provision, a government employee may be summarily discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.756" offset="5140773">Here, we do have a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.077" offset="5146102">We have a statute which provides that before he can be discharged, it has to be for cause and after certain provisions specified by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.792" offset="5188942">The Procedural Due Process as this Court as many times stated is a flexible concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.137" offset="5218304">Say, you do not have fixed rules, you got to weigh competing interests in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.656" offset="5236381">Here, we have two competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.719" offset="5244635">On the one hand is the obvious interest of a government employee not to have his federal employment finally terminated without procedures in which he can fairly present his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.002" offset="5289775">On the other hand, there is a very strong government interest of removing incompetent, unsuitable employees from the public payroll so that the government can proceed with its business effectively and expeditiously and obviously, if a pre-termination hearing is required in every case, this is inevitably bound to delay the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.499" offset="5379741">It seems to me that itself evident that if in every case, an employee has the option for a hearing, many employees knowing of the delay, is just going to request a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.364" offset="5427179">Some statistics that I referred to in an article by Professor Merrill that is quoted in our opponent’s brief in the 59 University of Virginia Law Review points out that a relatively small percentage of government disciplinary actions are taken to hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.728" offset="5500635">The figures we have, it is something like maybe 10% or something in that range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.601" offset="5524146">And inevitably, this would lead to a proliferation of these hearings to delays in discharging incompetent or unsuitable government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.910" offset="5581406">Now, we think that the Due Process requires no more in this situation than is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.880" offset="5609305">That is the employee has -- this is not a case where someone is cutoff with a letter saying you are terminated today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.392" offset="5639293">The employee has the opportunity to present informally to be sure but has the opportunity to present to his agency any facts that he believes mitigate against the proposal or show that it its uncertainty, for example he can show that perhaps the whole thing rests on a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.661" offset="5716407">Maybe the facts are wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.126" offset="8506284">Mr. Friedman has told you part of the story on the suspension, he did not tell you all the story and I believe it is important to tell you that story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.645" offset="8540348">At a later hearing after Mr. Kennedy was suspended, the government capitulated, gave Mr. Kennedy all his money back and supposedly expunged that matter from the record that 60-day suspension that they held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.297" offset="8586951">Furthermore, one of the charges which was not sustained in that suspension was the charge of leafleting with the press out in the lobby.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.449" offset="8631568">It was later resuscitated and used as a basis for his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.700" offset="8656541">With respect to the actual charges relating to the discharge, I think I can say this, Mr. Kennedy -- the fact show that Mr. Kennedy did participate in the press conference, he participated as a union representative with four other unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.017" offset="8725817">He is the only one to my knowledge who was punished for that press conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.359" offset="8743163">As I also noted that charge was not sustained in the suspension, but later brought back in the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.397" offset="8767404">Second, Mr. Kennedy was accosted by man named James White Eagle Stewart, an Indian who had negotiations going on with OEO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.755" offset="8796766">Mr. Stewart stated to Mr. Kennedy that Mr. Verduin, the Regional Director had said he would give him a $100,000.00 grant if Mr. Kennedy would be implicated in some actions which would lead to his fining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.150" offset="8846399">Mr. Stewart said this not only to Mr. Kennedy, but to Ms. Laura Rockwell, to four other employees and to the entire union at a union meeting. It was not Mr. Kennedy who said this to the union meeting, it was Mr. Stewart himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.121" offset="8898226">Mr. Kennedy did the following things with this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.327" offset="8911078">First, he sent a night letter to Mr. Verduin’s superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.745" offset="8924766">He did not charge bribery, he simply alluded to the events has he had been told.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.769" offset="8940857">Second, when a reporter called him, he mentioned the story to the reporter that the reporter called him first and asked the reporter check with the source of the story before doing anything about it and help him with the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.492" offset="8991744">Third, he had the man who made the charges go over to Senator Stevenson’s office and fill out an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.165" offset="9014418">In view of the unique situation where a supervisor, at least the employee has reasonable cause to believe, the Supervisor is out to get him, I think Mr. Kennedy acted with remarkable restraint in his approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="3476.288" offset="13982908">I might add that the Civil Service Commission in reading the Lloyd-La Follette Act to proscribe off to the speech has not only worked across purposes to Congress’s original intention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.752" offset="14148733">Chief Judge Reynolds in the Eastern District of Wisconsin also when faced with a similar efficiency standard on a state level had no difficulty in finding it vague and unreliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3761.472" offset="15123623">The government’s assertions that there were such regulation has depend upon the Purpose Clause of certain OEO regulations and depend upon a regulation which is laid with conduct, not speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.544" offset="15175973">And I believe that is the government’s failure to discern that there is a difference between conduct and speech which causes this problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3785.037" offset="15217873">Thank you Mr. Barnhill and you have about three minutes Mr. Friedman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="3787.901" offset="15229367">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.311" offset="15238980">As a specific OEO regulation which we have quoted in pages 42 and 43 of our brief which states that employees should avoid any action which might result or give the appearance of and, I quote, “affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of OEO and the government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.584" offset="15320064">while the regulation does not in terms refer to speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.340" offset="15339081">It seems to us that action is a broad enough phrase and certainly I find it where there is amazing -- the suggestion that there is an absolute immunity, a government employee can say anything he pleases under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.202" offset="15394565">And because of speech, he is somehow not subject to discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.016" offset="15413791">That is what the Court of Appeals and the District Court has held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.845" offset="15429151">Now, the claimant’s been -- the suggestion was made by Mr. Justice White that perhaps this thing involves a denial of liberty and this is distinguished from property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.783" offset="15476903">I think the answer that the liberty, any liberty here is the fact that he is branded if you want to call that as a man who has done bad things and maybe difficult for him to find a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.352" offset="15515146">He can fully protect himself on that aspect of the case certainly through the hearing that will subsequently be conducted before the Civil Service Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3868.117" offset="15550255">Why is the hearing been denied? Been delayed, excuse me.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="3871.340" offset="15563107">The hearing Mr. Justice has been delayed because of the pendency of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.449" offset="15575542">Now, I could say that I understand, I had this morning checked with the Chicago Office of the Civil Service Commission where the hearing would be held and I was told that in fact the hearing has been terminated because of the fact that Mr. Kennedy is now back on payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.708" offset="15660596">But the hearing was delayed but if things had proceeded normally, the hearing would have been held and Mr. Kennedy would have had an opportunity to try out before the Civil Service Commission, all of these defenses which he now asserts exist to the charges made against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.911" offset="15749413">I would just like to respond the contention that was made that in the answer, Mr. Kennedy file to the proposed discharge that he denies all of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.615" offset="15792253">That is set forth at page 62 of the appendix and there is no denial of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.672" offset="15812420">The only statement is that Mr. Kennedy is entitled to a fair and impartial hearing filed prior to any adverse action being taken against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.961" offset="15845648">The thing then summarizes what Mr. Kennedy believes the hearing should consist of and that says the present adverse action procedure fails in substantial ways to provide all these rudimentary elements required for a due process hearing that therefore, the proceedings are invalid and null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.100" offset="15910222">This is not a denial, this is –-</text>

            <text syncTime="3959.786" offset="15916910">He does say it that the Court might have found it that conversations for which he is being punished are inaccurately set forth in the adverse action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3972.677" offset="15968528">That it seems to me is in response to the contention that this is a denial of his rights of free speech thing.</text>
