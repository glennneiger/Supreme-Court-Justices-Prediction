            <label>Mr. Norman C. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="27.336" offset="186096">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.008" offset="196754">The present case comes before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and it presents the question of the right to a trial by jury in an action brought by a landlord to recover possession of real property pursuant to the District of Columbia statutory eviction proceeding and, also it raises the question of the right to a jury trial on the tenant’s counter claims for money damages brought in that same proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.698" offset="307513">Briefly stated, the facts of the case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.669" offset="319425">In August of 1971, the respondent landlord sued the petitioner for possession of premises held under a lease alleging non-payment of rent for a three-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.370" offset="370207">On the answer day, the tenant filed an answer denying that any rent was owed because of the failure of the landlord to maintain the premises in compliance with the District of Columbia Housing Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.559" offset="410958">The case law of the District of Columbia and the Administrative Regulations there permit a tenant to raise this defense at a possessory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.678" offset="443455">The tenant also filed affirmative claims seeking a money judgment for expenses incurred by him to repair the premises and for return of rent paid while the landlord was in breach of his warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.212" offset="493610">The applicable rules of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia permit the tenant to raise these affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.925" offset="524434">At the same time, on the answer day, the tenant demanded a trial by jury, paid the requisite fees, and complied with all necessary requirements for demand of jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.054" offset="564976">The trial judge struck the jury demand over the objection of the tenant that he was constitutionally entitled to a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.189" offset="593502">The case was subsequently tried by the court and the judgment for possession was rendered for the landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.706" offset="619624">On appeal, the court below affirmed the decision of the trial court holding that Congress, in 1970, had repealed the statutory right to a jury trial in these eviction proceedings and that there was no constitutional right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment in such proceedings.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="159.149" offset="713352">The trial court and the proceeding at the trial court ended in a judgment for the landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.933" offset="732473">We presume that it was a judgment on the counterclaims as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.928" offset="744490">In this respect, evidence tending to proof of the counterclaims was submitted at the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.808" offset="775941">It wasn’t admitted into evidence because of the lack of an authenticating witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.343" offset="790152">But, nevertheless, the proper was made and we assumed that the trial judge did rule on the counterclaims.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.615" offset="827246">Well, doesn’t Judge Riley’s opinion in the Court of Appeals give the impression that rule of the Superior Court permits the raising of that claim as a defense only, but that if you want a money judgment on your counterclaim, you have to simply pursue a different remedy in the Superior Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="448.395" offset="1870367">Our main brief at page 7, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.593" offset="1931076">It is quite clear at this date that the Seventh Amendment applies to the District of Columbia in Capital Traction versus Hof decided in 1899 this Court squarely held that the Seventh Amendment was applicable to the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.803" offset="1987918">The question then is the standard to be applied under the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.667" offset="2003383">It is quite clear from various decisions of this Court that the Seventh Amendment preserves the right to jury trial as it existed in England in 1791 at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.208" offset="2049567">Since 1830, this court, in Parsons v. Bedford and subsequently and most recently in Ross v. Bernhard in 1970, stated that the test to be applied to determine the Seventh Amendment right is to look to the closest historical counterpart of common law and determine there if the nature of the issue to be resolved is legal and, thus, triable by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.833" offset="2144131">In other words, the reference must be to the right asserted and the remedy sought, and then to the actions in England in 1791.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.461" offset="2178612">The test does not require that there’d be a precise counterpart.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.635" offset="2195331">This was clearly pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.913" offset="2200451">It doesn’t matter if the statute -- if the present day action is embodied in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.190" offset="2221558">I think the point there is quite obvious that much of the common law has undergone an evolution and if any precise counterpart were required, then certainly the Seventh Amendment would be in anachronism.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.923" offset="2284460">Most of the recent cases involving the Seventh Amendment such as Beacon Theaters versus Westover, Dairy Queen v. Wood, and Ross v. Bernhard have arisen as a result of the merger of law and equity by way of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.468" offset="2346632">The problems of merger are not involved in this case because it’s never been suggested that a suit for possession, such as the present one, was ever within the jurisdiction of the Court of Equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.098" offset="2389159">It’s quite clear that actions for possessions of real property present, perhaps, the classic case of actions tried by juries at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.724" offset="2423641">This Court, in Whitehead v. Shattuck and again restated in Ross v. Bernhard, indicated that action seeking to recover possession of real property are unmistakably legal actions and jury trial would, thus, be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.679" offset="2487484">At common law, since feudal times, there were several actions available to determine the right to possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.359" offset="2510158">Each had to do with particular circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.478" offset="2526668">In our brief, we deal with the three-principle actions: the writ of assize of novel disseisin, the writ of entry, and the writ of ejectment.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.691" offset="3103556">What happened, ejectment became the one form of action to try possession around the 1700s.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.520" offset="3138873">During this period, it was the simplest action where anyone could try either possession or title, but there’s no question, but in 1791 they did try possession, but the forcible entry and detainer actions did not try possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.604" offset="3191118">They merely restored a party who was ousted by force back to possession, whether or not he had a right to possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.862" offset="3216196">And then, they left the parties to go their own way through the civil actions to determine the right to possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.151" offset="3253394">Another point, Your Honor, the justices of the peace in England in 1791 bear no correspondence to the justices of the peace as we think of them today or as they existed in the District of Columbia in the early 1800s.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.278" offset="3313894">They were courts of record.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.786" offset="3687863">The basis for the decision in Hof was the fact that the justice of the peace in the District of Columbia did not have the power to instruct or superintend the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.823" offset="3748049">The basis of the decision really is that it wasn’t a court of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.725" offset="3771664">What Hof said, essentially, was that “well, maybe the premise should be laid” and between 1801 and 1864 the Justice of the Peace Court in the district, being the lowest court, had exclusive jurisdiction over all eviction proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.133" offset="3837283">They had jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.731" offset="3843657">The judge did not instruct them.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.027" offset="3848882">The jury merely decided the issue once the evidence was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.886" offset="3872287">In 1899, long after this period of between 1801 and 1864, the court looking back said that the justice of the peace trials were not common law jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.681" offset="3947520">The court below attempted to rely on that as a break in the history of the right to jury trial, that if there is no question that Congress didn’t intend that these be jury trials, the courts in the district had always thought that the justice of the peace jury trials were common law jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.375" offset="4022230">Today, the entire problem doesn’t exist since we have available a court which can give a constitutional jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.633" offset="4127242">The point that we have made, Your Honor, I believe is the fact that the three common law actions which we cite: assize, entry, and ejectment were the principal actions to try the right to possession, and those actions were prevailing in 1791, the critical date for the Seventh Amendment, and therefore, today, we should have a jury trial on the action in the statutory proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.742" offset="4251690">Much has been said by the respondents in the amicus curiae about the fact that the proceeding that we have is a summary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.195" offset="4289515">The argument there is that the summary proceeding is inconsistent with the right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.898" offset="4312294">They rely very heavily on this Court’s decision in Lindsey v. Normet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.529" offset="4330893">In Lindsey, it was held that the State of Oregon did not violate the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment by restricting the issues which could be raised in an eviction proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.264" offset="4377809">The law of the District of Columbia, as we noted, however, permits a tenant to defend a suit for non-payment on the basis of a breach of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.356" offset="4410201">Moreover, it also permits the counterclaims to be filed in the same proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.936" offset="4428487">It’s not a summary proceeding in the sense of the Oregon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.490" offset="4442697">But even notwithstanding that, Oregon itself permits such a jury trial in a far more summary proceeding than we have here in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.214" offset="4481567">The term “summary” only applies to a shortened or simplified procedure such as restricting the litigable issues, short return dates, unnecessary responsive pleadings, and limited discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.802" offset="4531931">The historians generally agree that assize of novel disseisin and entry were equally as summary as the present day eviction statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.180" offset="5845473">Mr. Chief Justice and mem -- and the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.811" offset="5863967">In connection with this particular question, I might say that the statute was repealed in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.827" offset="5904091">The statute was passed by Congress in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.687" offset="5923527">When the district Columbia took the Maryland law in 1899, they took it as they saw it in that particular time and, the question about forcible entry and detainer was a modern method then to get possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.007" offset="5992803">They have, of course, ejectment actions, but most of the time, they use a forcible entry and detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.187" offset="6017463">This was not a jury trial because it was referred to two justices of the peace or commissioners who had no right to instruct the jury, had no right to grant a new trial, or tell the jury what the law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.303" offset="6077962">Now, this continued on until 1964 when a statute was passed, giving the Supreme Court at that time a right to hear these cases de novo and a jury trial in the Supreme Court if there was a loss in the Justices of the Peace Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.379" offset="6158315">In 1964.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="1525.932" offset="6180467">Now, this continued on until the Hof case was decided where a comprehensive discussion and review of the historical situation was made by Mr. Justice Story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.638" offset="6231249">And, it was held at that time that the Justice of the Peace was not a common law court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.249" offset="6253714">It was not a court of law because of the fact that I’ve just mentioned and decided that since the second part of the amendment said that no facts should be reviewed another court, the issue in that case was whether it was review of the facts in the Supreme Court and, it was held that though there was a hearing and a trial before the justices of the peace this was not a common law action and, therefore, was not a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.986" offset="6364682">This went on, as I said, until 1921 with the de novo proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.479" offset="6386625">Now, it was then when there was a reorganization of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.269" offset="6405851">And the municipal court came into being, giving the rights and power to pass on slander and tort actions and so forth, that they, pardon me -- that they passed the law to state that a jury trial will be had in cases involving possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.039" offset="6484950">It's almost a repetitious of the Seventeenth -- Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.978" offset="6504699">All the language of the Seventh Amendment was there plus in all actions involving possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.650" offset="6527373">So, Congress gave the court the right to hear cases involving possession with a jury trial and took it away in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.349" offset="6566139">Congress, having the power to give it, has certainly the power to take it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.010" offset="6584738">Now, whatever may be the reason it was taken away, the fact is there’s no more jury trials in Landlord and Tenant cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.077" offset="6617025">I might say in that same connection that, although there was some attempt to the short analogy with respect to ejectment, the ejectment statute is still on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.103" offset="6669166">It’s a cumbersome method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.870" offset="6676271">It requires a number of elements to be shown before you can have ejectment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.358" offset="6694139">You have to show title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.036" offset="6700931">You also have to give the tenant a right to redeem in six months and causes a lot of damage and a lot of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.917" offset="6728411">So, there’s no similarity between that and ejectment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.614" offset="6747220">With respect to the other two, it has to do with the justice of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.239" offset="6765714">You still couldn’t get any common law trial before the justice of the peace because they were not a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.452" offset="6790583">Now, we got the statute of 19 --</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="1741.396" offset="7042299">This was a statutory proceeding in 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.377" offset="7058286">It never existed before that particular date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.248" offset="7069780">So, therefore, it couldn’t have been in existence in England in 1799 when the matter first came to the attention of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.627" offset="7103216">So, I don’t see how they could they say that you had a jury trial at that particular time as a result of legislation and not common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.868" offset="7136235">There was no common law right to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.898" offset="7144385">Before the Hof case said that there was no common law proceeding in such a -- I’m sorry, such a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.442" offset="7174478">And, the only kind of a jury trial you could have is before the commissioners who merely drew the 12 men and had no right to instruct the jury to do otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.314" offset="7210005">Now in 1921, as I say, the right was given to the Municipal Court and then it was taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.745" offset="7239680">Now with respect to the second point made by the petitioner that because he has filed a counterclaim, recoupment is set-off, this gives him a right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.327" offset="7294015">Of course, if that is so, that would be present in every one of these 122,000 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.465" offset="7318570">Such a claim could be made in that and deprive the landlord of his property while the tenant litigates what he claims to be his rights, as criticized by this Court in the Normet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.081" offset="7369038">The Normet case said that the landlord shouldn’t be required to stand by while he litigates those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.360" offset="7394220">And when you go into that particular branch of the procedure, there’ll be discovery and all kinds of reasons for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.603" offset="7431210">My experience had been, and I guess I had more of Landlord and Tenant cases than anybody in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.574" offset="7455033">That these land -- when we did had a jury right under 13702, the jury claim was made and interposed merely for delay because practically every one of the cases at least result in a tenant moving out owing four or five months rent or a settlement of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.003" offset="7532774">And, as I am informed by the clerk, that out of 600-somewhat cases juries demands were made, there are only six that were tried in the last year before the abolition of the jury system by this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.016" offset="7592856">Now it is also shown, it seems to me, that the creation of the right to claim the money for violations of the housing regulations in Javins was never recognized by the Javins case as a legal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.561" offset="7662968">It was purely an equitable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.200" offset="7673522">And on page 19 of the amicus curiae brief, there is a referral by Judge Wright as to what had happened with respect to the Doctrine, and it concludes by this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.030" offset="7744888">“A remedy for every wrong is not cognizable by the courts of law and the complexities of the present so sure have brought about conditions which were unknown when the English Courts of Equity was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.423" offset="7802462">It was realized and the lower court’s decision was on the basis that when a claim of this type is made, it’s purely equitable because in the cited case of Molyneaux versus Townhouse, the claim for non-payment of rent is made and if the tenant can show he paid the rent or he had a right to pay it, this would give him a right to equitable conversion and have his tenancy reestablished.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.730" offset="7911654">In other words, it was purely a suit as to whether the rent was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.047" offset="7932970">If the rent was due, he, the tenant had a right to tender all the rents and that, would reinstate his tenancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.472" offset="7962645">So, that was all purely equitable0 and the defense’s recoupment is set-off and counterclaim were considered by the lower court as being purely equitable in nature and therefore not triable by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.292" offset="8021891">And, therefore, the Dairy Queen case has no application because, there, the issues were legal and equitable and here they are purely equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.453" offset="8058567">To show, with respect to a jury trial, the summary action would be destroyed completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.036" offset="8088869">The Code Title 16-1501 makes the complaint returnable in seven clear days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.652" offset="8119380">It is only necessary if you cannot find the defendant to post a summons on the door.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.922" offset="8208405">Although it was not mentioned in my brief, it does not do complete justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.482" offset="8230661">As recited Rule, the Rule 3 allows the landlord to ask for a personal money judgment if the tenant makes a claim for recoupment set-off and counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.552" offset="8274965">But, in footnote number 64 in the Javins case, it has been said that if the tenant caused the damage, then this was not be a defense of the landlord’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.213" offset="8317597">Now, if the tenant caused the damage, the landlord has a right of action for that damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.418" offset="8338390">He can’t make it in this particular claim because there’s no provision in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.905" offset="8356362">Then, he’s got to file his own independent action to make his claim while the tenant goes ahead with his claim and it is tried it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.467" offset="8390635">In order to have a due process situation, all the claims should be litigated in one particular action and this cannot be done under Rule 5 (c) and that’s --</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.639" offset="8695327">I think that I failed to indicate the fact that this Court has certainly recognized the fact that the jury system has been evolving for centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.913" offset="8744438">The point being that the Seventh Amendment doesn’t protect the procedural incidence of a jury trial. It merely protects the substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.429" offset="8786442">And, it’s quite clear that the substance of jury trial in 1791 was quite the same as it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.724" offset="8819670">As we have traced the history, perhaps maybe too far, back to the 11th -- 12th Century, of course we have to realize the juries were undergoing change during that time and this is when juries were first being formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.251" offset="8889783">Mr. Miller’s argument appears to be directed at what occurred after 1791, the Hof case and most of the problems there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.307" offset="8930011">Anything occurring after 1791 appears to be irrelevant for the jury determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.049" offset="8956970">The Ross test seems to be clear that we have to look to the common law of England in 1791.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.473" offset="8990616">In Hof, I think it’s important to show that the mistake that was made that the courts and everyone in the District of Columbia thought that the justice of the peace jury trials were common law jury trials, they tried debt actions over $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.312" offset="9070028">They’re jurisdiction -- they’re exclusive jurisdiction was up to $50, I believe, at some point during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.246" offset="9105763">Mr. Miller has also indicated that the -- for some reason, the tenants are going to file counterclaims and the 122,000 cases, this is really unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.408" offset="9154351">It’s quite clear that jury trials are not demanded except in the very few cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.048" offset="9180891">As he indicated himself, only eight trials occurred in 1971, eight jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.393" offset="9202312">I think 17cases went to jury and 9 settled before the jury rendered a verdict.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2287.494" offset="9226762">But he said 600 demands were made for dilatory purposes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_c_barnett" startTime="2294.449" stopTime="2388.212">
            <label>Mr. Norman C. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="2294.449" offset="9254557">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.521" offset="9262811">Well, of course he characterizes this as a dilatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.427" offset="9274410">It’s quite obvious that landlord-tenant cases, like any other case where jury demands are filed, that most cases settle the trial problems: attorneys not having time to go to trial, this type of problem, and the parties just wanting to settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.646" offset="9331357">These cases settle much easier than a normal civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.944" offset="9360509">The question of dilatoriness is certainly Mr. Miller’s characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.049" offset="9372944">In fact, the landlord is quiet adequately protected in these proceedings because of this protective procedure which Judge Wright set out in the Javins decision and later amplified in another case, Bell versus Tsintolas Realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.510" offset="9434802">That procedure permits the landlord or requires the tenant to put into the registry of the court the pending rent during the -- the rent pending the proceeding until the trial date comes up. Certainly, what the landlord is seeking in these cases is the rent and, of course, as long as he’s protected, the court has held of the money in an escrow account which it can disperse at the end of the case, he’s fully protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.374" offset="9542217">So it’s certain now that the backlog doesn’t affect the landlord, if there is a backlog at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.605" offset="9575131">In 1971, the Chief Judge of the Superior Court issued a ruling whereby jury trials in landlord and tenant cases were to take place three weeks after the return date, within three weeks after the return date.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.316" offset="9694041">As I indicated the Chief Judge had imposed a three-week limit on jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.885" offset="9716297">This is at the time when the question was in dispute before the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.586" offset="9739076">In practice today, judge trials in the Landlord and Tenant Court are backlogged anywhere from four to six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.210" offset="9765616">So the delay argument, the dilatoriness, I think, really means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.670" offset="9795396">Finally, I’d like to conclude, Your Honor, just by noting the historical linage in this case being so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.645" offset="9823295">Mr. Miller certainly hasn’t shown us anything that takes away from that and the court has, on numerous occasions, indicated that all possible doubts regarding the Seventh Amendment should be resolved in favor of a jury trial.</text>
