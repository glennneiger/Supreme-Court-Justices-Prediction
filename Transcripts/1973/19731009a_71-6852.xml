            <label>Ms. Marguerite M. Buckley</label>
            <text syncTime="24.534" offset="174916">Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.703" offset="191530">I am the counsel for Donald Lubin, the petitioner in this case spoke individually and on behalf of the members of his class.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.660" offset="231340">This case first begin a year ago in February, at which time approximately 22 people who were desirers of becoming candidate and the forthcoming elections came to me and we all proceeded to the office of the registrar, the Recorder Registrar in the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.358" offset="326217">Included among these 22 people were men and women, Black and White, most strictly some Freedom Party members but also two members of the Democratic Party, a member of the Republican Party and a member of the American-Independent Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.425" offset="394449">They had two things in common, they wanted to be candidates because they had something to say to the electors and they could not afford to pay the filing fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.496" offset="442723">Now, there was one other distinction also and that was that most of the people who wanted to become candidates, who are running for a primary position at political office which required them to be a member of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.270" offset="509806">But in county and city elections in California, most of the offices are nonpartisan and therefore, Donald Lubin who wished to run for the office of board of supervisor was running in a general election, not a primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.348" offset="582113">He was not a member of a party for purposes of ballot status.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.858" offset="616176">We filed a writ of mandamus asking the -- both the Recorder Registrar of the County of Los Angeles and the Secretary of State of California to issue nomination papers to these people without the necessity of paying fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.150" offset="693394">We were granted a temporary injunction by Judge Cole of the Los Angeles Superior Court and an ultimate writ was set for hearing on March 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.707" offset="731533">At that time, Judge Rehnquist sitting in the Los Angeles County Superior Court held that as a matter of law, Bullock applying that as a matter of law, California fees were reasonable and the fact that there was no alternative did not matter under Bullock.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.625" offset="827246">Thereafter, I filed another writ of mandate in the Appellate Court in California, procedure which is an alternate to an appeal.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="196.094" offset="861100">Ms. Buckley, would Judge Weinkie's ruling have been appealable itself to the District Court of Appeal had you chosen to go that route?</text>

            <label>Ms. Marguerite M. Buckley</label>
            <text syncTime="203.037" offset="888895">Yes, but it would have been meaningless in terms of relief for our clients because we could never have gotten any kind of hearing before the elections would be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.243" offset="937691">The only reasonable choice we had was filled by way of writ of mandate to the Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.918" offset="968411">To give them the best opportunity to rule reasonably, we attached a copy of the transcript to the hearing in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.354" offset="1018149">We were denied with that hearing and we promptly filed a writ of mandate in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.808" offset="1039987">And again, the transcript of the hearings including Judge Weinkie's statement at page three, to the effect that it appears to the Court that the fees are reasonable as a matter of law was before the Supreme Court and they denied the mandate without a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.798" offset="1583961">In a write-in situation and in the first place, Donald Lubin had a territory that covered 600,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.529" offset="1618860">As a write-in candidate, he would be required to make his name known to those people not only well enough so that they recognize it on the ballot, but so that they could remember it to write it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.445" offset="1666508">Now, I cited in my reply brief an instance in California where we had a case of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.502" offset="1694720">A man by the name of Vicenzia was placed on the ballot to take votes away from a man by the name of Valencia and the circumstances around that particular filing made it obvious that there was only one reason for that filing to be done and that was that the voters could even make a mistake between Vicenzia and Valencia and not be able to vote for the man that they wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.872" offset="1804225">How much more difficult would it be for them to remember the man’s name to write it down as the write-in candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.688" offset="1827527">Secondly, as a candidate on the ballot, you were entitled to all sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.832" offset="1848111">Number one, you are entitled the equal time on radio and TV.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.981" offset="1864620">Number two, every major newspaper has a practice, in Los Angeles County for instance, of writing articles on the ballot candidates at least once and possibly twice during the campaign.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.239" offset="2201704">If what you offer as an alternative is write-in campaign, you are placing a much greater burden on those people who cannot afford even in many cases the beginning of filing fee and what you are requiring them to do is additional kinds of work that will require more resources than the normal candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.152" offset="2313404">You are putting them in an unfair position and the different kind of position than those people who can afford to pay the fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.993" offset="3088718">What is an issue is whether we can deny people who cannot afford to pay for the privilege of running and opportunity to participate meaningfully in the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.801" offset="3139918">And I think that when we look at the facts that the United States which is one of the greatest democracies has a lower voting turnout than many of the other democracies according to the New York Times, then we have to begin to ask why.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.795" offset="3207941">And part of why is because in this country, approximately 25% of the people are on a poverty standard of living.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.779" offset="3243886">According to the United States, director of a poverty neighborhood legal services and I remember our guidelines very well, $3,500.00 for a family of four and yet the Bureau of Labor Standards says that you need $7,000.00 for a family of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.987" offset="3316715">Well, if you do not have enough money to feed your family, how are you going to be able to take part in the political process and if it need addition, people who want to represent you and who come from your own class and do not have money either can’t even get on the ballot, then you do not want to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.693" offset="3391530">Now, I think so that this Court has made it quite clear that the rights of voters are intertwined with the rights of candidates but I think that it is time for the Court to make the decision that there is a right to be a candidate, to take a forthright position and say that you cannot have elections without candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.999" offset="6068767">There were certain preliminary questions asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.488" offset="6082664">As I understand this election, this was a true primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.612" offset="6099174">In California, you have a primary votes for partisan and nonpartisan officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.863" offset="6120176">As to partisan officers, only those persons registered with the party can vote in that particular primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.111" offset="6153195">But, the local officers and judicial officers are all nonpartisan and every qualified voter who is registered in the district can vote for one of those offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.794" offset="6195931">Ever since 1926, if a nonpartisan office, a person gets the majority, he is then and they are elected and then for him, it becomes a general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.644" offset="6239295">But otherwise, it remains a primary and the one who gets the most votes and the one who gets the second most votes, then is the -- are the two nominated candidates who are -- then go before the voters and the general election in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.096" offset="6301153">And, if I am correct that this was the Fourth District, that happened then, there were two candidates that got the most and next to the most voters neither one getting majority and one of them was elected in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.700" offset="6347546">The question was asked, what is the status of a denial without opinion by the Supreme Court of a writ of mandate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.539" offset="6394880">There are three Supreme Court cases that definitely hold that the denial by minute order of an application for a writ of mandate is simply a refusal by the state’s Supreme Court to exercise its original jurisdiction and is not an adjudication on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.349" offset="8570149">As this Court itself said in Bullock versus Carter, that fee was too high but not all fees are invalid and there becomes a time when the fee becomes too high.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.591" offset="8671086">Well, I would say this, whether there is a specific appropriation or not if the money spent on the election is probably stable -- far greater than the fees collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.087" offset="8717061">And, if that is true, does it make too much difference that there is a specific appropriation that this particular fund he used for this particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.961" offset="8812565">Ms. Buckley mentions in our brief that very few people took advantage of give a dollar to the party of your choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.610" offset="8839210">Well, it is very easy to see that great many people may not be particularly concerned with a particular political party as a whole, but maybe very much concerned with the particular candidate especially a non-partisan candidate where a person carrying nothing at all about parties would be very interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.554" offset="8910994">So I do not know think that that is a good illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.391" offset="8926354">She also raises in her brief although she hadn’t said it early that there is a provision that you have to get at least 1% of the vote to get a nomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.381" offset="8970240">That may work some hardship in the case of some very small political parties but in a case of a non-partisan, it is almost inconceivable that somebody would get less 1% of the vote and yet be the second person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.718" offset="9039621">Although all of those voted for, you have to have at least 52 candidates and the very unusual situation to have that so it would be practically impossible for a person to get second in amount of votes in a non-partisan office and not have at least 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.473" offset="9110674">And, even if that should happen, it would be practically impossible to the person that got that few votes in the primary would then receive the majority in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.814" offset="9152052">A great deal that Ms. Buckley has said I think is within her brief and has been answered in our brief unless the Court has further questions, that is all I have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.262" offset="9201789">Thank you Mr. Gaylord.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.136" offset="9209313">Ms. Buckley, you have about six minutes left if you want to use them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.970" offset="9272633">In respect to the question of whether the Supreme Court of the state of California had considered the matter prior to denying it, I would like to draw to your attention the fact that in my experience, the Supreme Court of the state of California generally when presented with the writ of mandate for the first time which it does not believe it has sufficient information to deal with kicks it back to the Appellate Court for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.050" offset="9416934">And, that same thing happened in the case of Zapata versus Davidson to 24 California Appellate decisions third 823.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.411" offset="9462387">On this very question of the filing fees in the elections that we were talking about, that case were sent to the Appellate Court in April, one month after the Supreme Court had denied us summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.730" offset="9527693">And, when presented with a writ of mandate on the exact same question, they sent it to Zapata versus Davidson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.360" offset="9554233">And the Appellate Court determined that the filing fees were in fact unconstitutional based on the Bullock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.200" offset="9585580">So I would like at this time to draw your attention to a case which has not been cited in my brief and that is a Zapata versus Davidson, 24 C A third 283 and that is a 1972 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.835" offset="9644095">Now secondly, I would like to discuss very briefly the question of the reasonableness of the California fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.882" offset="9684323">When counsel leads you to believe that Texas was so different in California, I believe he misstates the question because the Texas fees in some case on state levels were less than those charged in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.782" offset="9755899">As I read the Texas statute, the real high fees, the $6,000.00 and $8,000.00 were primarily on county levels, but that the state positions ran from $150.00 to $850.00 or $1,000.00 and that is exactly where California is at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.877" offset="9832281">Furthermore, the case of Socialist Party versus all was cited as having legitimized California filing fees but that is a 1909 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.426" offset="9890482">And, at that time, California had filing fees ranging from $10.00 to $50.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.265" offset="9913783">It had no relationship to the emoluments of office and --</text>
