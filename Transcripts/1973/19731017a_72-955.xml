            <text syncTime="49.582" offset="275122">Seventh Circuit indicated that there would be equitable relief available if the case were proven against the two state judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.417" offset="326426">That part of the Seventh Circuit appeal is the subject to the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.399" offset="350354">The Seventh Circuit also indicated that there would be mandatory injunctive relief available against the State's Attorney of Alexander County and that part of the Seventh Circuit's Judgment is the concern of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.201" offset="425587">There is a third petition for certiorari filed on behalf of Peyton Berbling, the immediate past State's Attorney of Alexander County and his investigator Earl Shepherd and the Police Chief of Cairo, Illinois, Chief Meisenheimer.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.272" offset="649822">The only two cases that are before this Court in terms of certiorari having been granted have to do with the injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.829" offset="696111">Now the question has been raise during the course of the previous oral argument with respect to the fact that State's Attorney Spomer was not named as an original defendant in this case and that there are no specific factual allegations against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.667" offset="787435">The brief for the Petitioner Spomer does not raise that argument and it was a decision by Mr. Spomer consistent with my advice to him that whatever defense he would have and whatever claim he would have with respect to the correctness of the Seventh Circuit's judgment on the basis of the carryover of the allegations of Berbling to allegations against Spomer that he should not and he is so decided that he should not raise that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.802" offset="943961">The waiver that we make with respect to any claim that the allegations with respect to Berbling do not carryover to Spomer may give this Court an indication of how significant the basic underlying issue is both to the State's Attorney of Alexander County and to State Prosecutors generally in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.809" offset="3063954">The first part of the answer, these are basic contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.845" offset="3080150">That these allegations if stated against Spomer directly instead of had to continued an office, if Berbling continued an office would not state a cause of action under 1983 in any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.432" offset="3134485">It -- it's a secondary position not to the extent that they do are found to state an action. That they would state an action against the successor in office, the substitute party so long as there is no declaration and the burden is upon him to make a declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.001" offset="3204702">That he is going to deviate from those policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.570" offset="3275024">So far as I'm aware in Alexander County since December when Spomer took over.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.001" offset="3300728">It might also be said that the Seventh Circuit that at the time the ruling was issued it should have been apparent to the Seventh Circuit that Berbling would not be an office after December 5 because he did not run for re-election.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.602" offset="3431131">Yes, although it could be the term at the time they issued that opinion that the Berbling would not succeed himself in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.932" offset="3472509">It was impossible for him to succeed himself an office simply because he had not filed for re-election in the filing date is in -- was the previous December.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.728" offset="3527680">With respect to the merits of the case, there has been some discussion as to whether the argument that is offered here and I suppose with respect to both petitioners, this one and the one in the previous cases whether the argument is one of immunity or one of scope of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.773" offset="3615869">For purposes of this petitioner, I don't think it makes a great deal of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.414" offset="3642410">How you view it simply because whether you view it as an immunity argument or as a scope of the remedy argument that position of the petitioner -- State's Attorney is taking is that this kind of remedy, this mandatory injunction could under no circumstances in any case ever be appropriately issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.885" offset="3744287">So whether the argument is phrased in terms of scope of the remedy or absolute immunity, its functional purpose from our view is precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.364" offset="3794233">I might add also that although I think that -- and I agree with the position of the petition the previous case, with respect to the appropriateness of the remedy directed against the judges, I would submit that the argument of the States Attorney is still stronger than that of the judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.213" offset="3885558">Essentially, what the Seventh Circuit would force the United States District judge to do is to exercise a supervisory jurisdiction over both a trial judge and the state prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.441" offset="3950550">I think it is improper that it does either but I might say that at least when it comes to exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the state trial judge the United States District judges doing something that is not too far remote from what he is expected to do with his own docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.728" offset="4023693">Because the Federal trial judge of course makes decisions as to bail and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.498" offset="4058697">When it comes to exercising supervisory, excuse me, supervisory jurisdiction over the State's Attorney, the Court is crossing into the realm of prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.384" offset="4114286">And I think for reasons that we have stated innumerable times in our briefs it is the function that cannot be effectively performed by most judges and for those few judges who could effectively perform it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.098" offset="4185130">It would be highly inappropriate to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.482" offset="4198713">I might add also, that the reason that this ruling is so particularly crucial for prosecutors throughout the nation is that there is aside from situations like those in Cairo, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.261" offset="4261825">There is in this country a large number of groups of people who have severe quarrels with the way criminal justices run whose quarrels generally fall on the side of their viewed insufficient prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.243" offset="4345731">And we submit that there is a very realistic possibility that if the judgment of the Seventh Circuit, this remedy is allowed to stand that we will open a real Pandora's Box with respect to suits against prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.305" offset="4417933">Now, the Pandora's Box argument is a common one I think that at least half the litigants who argued cases involving basic principles of law will use a variation of the Pandora's Box argument saying if you do this then the walls will all fall down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.048" offset="4480940">And perhaps there is a hyperbole in that argument in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.222" offset="4501629">I think not in the case of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.761" offset="4511765">There is presently in the State of Illinois, at least several groups, who are complaining vigorously that although they have not sued yet about what they consider to be insufficient efforts by the prosecutors not to proceed in given cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.228" offset="4585639">The most prominent of which in our state is the Citizens for Decent Literature who are complaining bitterly about the failure of various prosecutors to move against literature they consider obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.667" offset="4643422">There is a group of people who claim to represent rape victims who are concerned about the policies of prosecution with respect to rape cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.991" offset="4696712">There are groups that complain about the prosecutions with respect to environmental cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.464" offset="4718655">And I suspect that if the ruling stands up most prosecutors who have adopted a policy of declining of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.847" offset="4752091">Any violation of criminal statues involving in dispute between a tenant and a landlord, I suspect that both the tenants and the landlords will be in Federal Court claiming improper prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.044" offset="4808934">And I might add further that purely apart from the question of whether a Federal Judge could administer this rather a mammoth remedy that is called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.278" offset="4869851">There is the -- the basic question and I suppose this is an argument that speaks more to an immunity argument than to anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.356" offset="4902139">There is the basic question of forcing the prosecutor to spend his time in Court and defend his policies with respect to discretionary declamations of prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.733" offset="4955638">The plain fact of the matter is that I don't think any prosecutor that could long function if he had to depose on declamations of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.499" offset="5002762">I doubt that there is a prosecutor in this nation who prosecutes more than a fraction less than one-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.080" offset="5041110">Certainly, more than a fraction of the cases that are brought to him -- would he have to come to Federal Court and explain this declamation in each and every one of these cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.134" offset="5081234">Even if the case is not made, even if the petitioner fails to make his case so the plaintiffs fail to make their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.475" offset="5106625">The enormous burden on the prosecutor, I think would be a sufficient to justify, as it does in other areas, the application of an absolute immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.050" offset="5156989">And it is clear I might say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.326" offset="5166080">It is clear that the Seventh Circuit contemplated that the Federal District Court would address itself to individual decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.721" offset="5203592">There is a certain selective blindness exercised by the respondents in this case with respect to what exactly they won if you want to use that word in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.751" offset="5251762">And I quote from the language on the -- of the Seventh Circuit's opinion that said, "an initial decree might set out the general tone of rights to be protected and require only periodic reports of various types of aggregate data on actions on bail and sentencing and disposition of complaints."</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.272" offset="5329816">The Court expressed and I quote, "Complete confidence in the District Court's ability to set up further guides is required and if necessary to consider individual decisions" which appears at page 415 of 468 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.399" offset="5386344">So we are in effect talking about review of individual decisions to or not to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.926" offset="5412467">There has been citation of authority in this Court in which Federal Courts have exercised what might be called a pretrial supervision over state prosecutor by enjoining him from proceeding in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.045" offset="5484878">I state as we have stated in the briefs that this is a far different thing from exercising a general power to force the prosecutor to prosecute a case in a certain way and I might add that the complaint was not limited simply to the initiation of criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.922" offset="5564395">There were elements in the complaint that said that the prosecutor didn't present the case competently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.173" offset="5589473">Perhaps, the closing argument didn't appeal to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.850" offset="5616118">Or perhaps the way a witness was examined didn't appeal to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.173" offset="5629492">You're talking about very detailed regulation of the way a prosecutor tries his case and that is what the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.910" offset="5656346">And certainly what the plaintiffs contemplate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.841" offset="5668153">The fact of the matter is that those cases in which preliminary injunctions have been granted prior to trial or at least that has been suggested that it might be done are really no different in effect than a form of accelerated appellant review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.907" offset="5736385">So the Court saying in advance that this prosecution, this particular prosecution is brought in such bad faith or for such obvious harassment purposes that we're going to stop it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.638" offset="5783301">And the basic premise is that if we did not stop it now, we would just have to reverse it later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.106" offset="5809215">But it is still a review of an individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.393" offset="5822276">As I suggest in the brief, there are available and I think superior remedies, superior to that suggested by the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.843" offset="5864072">Indeed, I would say that each of the remedies considered by the Seventh Circuit including the most draconian one of all which is to say reversal of convictions of people who were properly prosecuted because the prosecutor refuses to proceed against other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.412" offset="5934393">I think that even that remedy is preferable to the remedy that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.993" offset="5960725">It seems to me what the Seventh Circuit did was take upon itself or if not take upon itself convey a power to the Federal District judges that no court should under any conditions ever exercise and that is the power to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.795" offset="6043899">The Federal judge simply should not service a prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.999" offset="6056751">Either in State or Federal Court and I think that that is what the Seventh Circuit opinion amounts to as a command to the Federal Judge that if certain cases are proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.801" offset="6099905">You have to preempt the decision of the prosecutor in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.771" offset="6119863">If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.928" offset="8860421">Instead, we are claiming that across the board, black complainants do not get relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.941" offset="8888529">It does not involve discretion at all when the State’s Attorney says I’m not going to take evidence of -- from blacks when they are victims of white criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.379" offset="8934296">It will moreover, when the judege -- when the State’s Attorney refuses to prosecute simply because the victim is black does not involve discretion at all either.</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.940" offset="9036487">Where the State’s Attorney refuses to investigate or refuses to prosecute, you cannot go to a State Court for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.000" offset="9076715">The -- one suggestion that Mr. Spomer has made in his brief is interestingly it odds in the petition of Mr. Berbling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.719" offset="9119660">Mr. Spomer suggesting that a cause of action in damages is preferable to equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.809" offset="9147977">Mr. Berbling of course is taking the opposite position in his petition before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.492" offset="9170756">I would suggest that damages would not be -- would not solve the problem because it would not prevent the ongoing discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.366" offset="9210253">What you could have in a situation where you had an action and damages is that the white citizens who are against the black -- efforts to free themselves collecting the defense fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.019" offset="9264797">And every time the State’s Attorney is found liable in damages, they pay it off but in the same sense, they manage to maintain their supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.738" offset="9295726">They manage to avoid prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.995" offset="9308682">I would suggest that that would not be a way to solve this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.492" offset="9334700">The basic relief that we are seeking is on a prohibitory nature that race not be used as a criterion in the exercise of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.762" offset="9375765">I think again that it would be premature to determine what precisely is the appropriate relief because I think the District Court must hear our evidence first and then fashion what would be considered appropriate relief by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.139" offset="9449326">In summary, when citizens are deprived of access to the criminal justice system, the fabric of a civilized society disintegrates and I submit to Your Honors that is what is happening in Cairo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.275" offset="10857848">And secondly, we would be willing to concede that if there has to be any remedy at all, between private parties in a Federal Court that that remedy rather than be the injunction be damages. I tend to think that there is a strong immunity argument against damages as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.222" offset="10929633">What I am trying to impress upon the Court is the degree of opposition and the degree perhaps of maybe outright terror would be the best word with which a state prosecutors would view proceedings under the Seventh Circuits opinion.</text>
