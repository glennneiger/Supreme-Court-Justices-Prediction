            <text syncTime="54.730" offset="295706">I represent the petitioners, the City of Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.482" offset="314723">The respondents are private persons operating offstreet parking facilities in the City of Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.759" offset="351817">On February 20, 1970, the respondent’s filed a suit to enjoin enforcement of the City of Pittsburgh parking tax ordnance and that ordinance imposed a tax on the privilege of engaging in offstreet parking transactions for a consideration and established the rate at 20% of the gross receipts derived.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.259" offset="477832">That ordinance replaced a 1969 ordinance, taxing the same privileges at the rate of 15% and that ordinance had in turn replaced a 1963 ordinance, taxing the same transactions at the rate of 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.276" offset="557871">The respondents are 12 in number and they operate 17,000 offstreet parking spaces in the downtown area of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.123" offset="609280">There are another 1,000 spaces operated by private persons not party to this suit and there are an additional 6,100 spaces operated by the Public Parking Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, a public municipal corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.489" offset="698723">The respondents’ allege basically that the competition of the public parking authority when combined with the 20% gross receipts tax of the City of Pittsburgh serves to confiscate their profits without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.641" offset="795272">The issues raised then are two.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.688" offset="1855530">So, the issue here is not whether or not the City of Pittsburgh had power to force the private operators out of business while the public operation remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.836" offset="1916134">The issue is whether or not under the Due Process Clause that the revenue measure on its face designed to raise revenue could be inquired into by the Court simply because it was unreasonable, simply because it might believe to be -- you might believe it to be excessive or even destructive of a particular business.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.135" offset="2029296">This Court has held on numerous occasions that if the power to tax exists, the extent of the burden is strictly a concern of the legislature no matter what the indirect effect of that tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.725" offset="3599673">There was a statistical compilation of income versus expenses and that compilation shows that nine of 14 of the operators -- or the projected expenses for the year 1970 where in compared to projected income that nine of 14 operations studied would show a loss, but that does not in anyway show confiscation.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.425" offset="3706462">That just is taking one standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.320" offset="3713985">There is not study as to the amount of salaries that were involved in the operating expenses as to whether or not they could be consider return on investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.149" offset="3757349">But I want to return Your Honor to the question, the conclusion that you could not pass the tax on. The factual situation shows that 25% of the supply is controlled by the public body; charging lower prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.073" offset="3821087">The record also shows that the public, the so called public competitors charging lower prices is full at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.834" offset="3860062">It is completely full at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.459" offset="3874586">With the demand exceeding supply by 4,000 spaces, that is another fact of record and as Justice Pomeroy points out on his dissent, I do not know how you can say it better.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.753" offset="3915755">An entrepreneur who controls 71% of the supply in a market of unsatisfied demand need not concern himself with the low cost competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.818" offset="3955984">The parking authority who controls 29% of the supply has no excess capacity and cannot serve his demand which the 71% competitor might drive away through price increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.489" offset="4014707">Now, with all due respect to Justice Roberts and the majority opinion, I think that when demand exceeds supply and the low cost competitor is at capacity to conclude that you do not have to attempt to pass on the tax in a form of a price increase is just sheer economic nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.402" offset="4102374">I think at the very least and as Justice Pomeroy also pointed out in his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.049" offset="4120973">At the time, he wrote his dissent, the respondents had indeed raised their prices and he stated at the very least you could go back and look at the effect of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.999" offset="4160784">You are talking about confiscation of property and to establish confiscation, the fact should show, there should be no doubt in anybody's mind that confiscation took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.734" offset="4207700">No doubt in anybody’s mind and I had submit that it is impossible not to have a doubt in these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.961" offset="4256601">I think another question in this case is the extent to which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the majority opinion attempts to set forth competition, the direct competitions of a governmental body as something unique in this area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.675" offset="4327445">The question of competition by governmental body and taxation at high rates was before this Court over a century ago in the VC Bank Note case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.613" offset="4367151">And in that case, this Court held that a 10% tax on bank notes admittedly excessive for the purpose of driving out a state bank notes which were in competition with the federal notes being issued by the federal government was profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.467" offset="4438622">That the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit judicial inquiry into the rate of the tax designed to raise revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.468" offset="4470596">That was a matter for the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.786" offset="4479896">Again, more recently in Puget Sound case cited in our brief, there, the issue was a 3% gross receipts tax imposed by the City of Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.411" offset="4526393">The tax was imposed upon a like company within -- with which the city was in direct competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.202" offset="4557531">This Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not immunize a private person from competition by the government even though the government is also levying a tax on the competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.015" offset="4632764">Now, if the power to compete exists and the power to tax at a rate exists, I do not see how two rights can make the wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.844" offset="4680098">We eventually get right back to a question of what rate of tax is reasonable or burdensome and that issue is for the legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.667" offset="4747389">The majority opinion also places some weight on a descent in the Magnano versus Hamilton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.467" offset="4782602">And that dissent states that it would be conceivable that a revenue measure on its face was only a mere disguise that it was so arbitrary that it was obvious that the intent was not to raise revenue, but that the attempt was to exert another power, perhaps a forbidden power such as confiscation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.559" offset="4906945">Well obviously, you couldn't determine that question on rate because in the Magnano case it was admitted that the rate of tax 15 cents a pound on olio was going to drive the olio companies out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.857" offset="4968176">So, you can not look to rate to determine whether that is the unusual circumstance involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.645" offset="5003285">And this revenue measure -- it is impossible to conclude that the measure is a disguise the attempt of the City of Pittsburgh to confiscate the property of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.413" offset="5078413">The measure on its face says it is raising revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.526" offset="5090847">It did raise revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.474" offset="5098684">So, if the court is going to engage in speculation as to what the intent was, if it does not accept the measure on its face, there is no reason to conclude that confiscation was the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.777" offset="5151869">I think it would be more reasonable to include that the City of Pittsburgh had successfully raised revenue before by imposing a parking tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.134" offset="5189277">That it was reasonable for the city to assume that when it increased the tax, revenue would increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.949" offset="5216549">It would also be reasonable to assume that since it is a parking tax and I think that we can all agree that parking in the downtown Metropolitan area is somewhat of a luxury, that it would not a be unreasonable to believe that if the price was raised in some of the areas involving these entire 24,000 spaces in downtown Pittsburgh, that some of this people coming in from the suburbs might continue to come in and pay an additional tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.731" offset="5347683">I think that would be the fair conclusion from an examination of this record and the unfair conclusion would be to conclude that the City of Pittsburgh didn't intend to raise revenue at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.278" offset="6285897">In the opening paragraph of the opinion and that is where a city imposes a 20% excise tax or parking tax and that is combined with the governmental operation of the exact identical business, does that constitute a taking under the Fourteenth Amendment or rather I should say under the Fifth Amendment made unlawful by the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.523" offset="6398851">Now, that is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.509" offset="6402821">The issue was not whether a tax standing by itself is unconstitutional and the issue is not whether the city has the power to impose an excise tax on these parking operators and the issue is not whether the city has the power to compete with the parking operators in conducting a parking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.789" offset="6499892">Of course, there is no question about any of those issues, but the issue is, can the city impose a 20% tax which the Commonwealth Court has declared by an unanimous vote of the excessive and unreasonable and which the Supreme Court has said is excessive and unreasonable and when combined --</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.347" offset="7086184">Now, these operators pay a rent which is enough to cover the amortization of the bonds, and then they share the profit with the parking authority 50/50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.626" offset="7127249">Now, these private operators, when I say share their profit 50/50, that is after all expenses, so that the burden of the expenses are on these private operators even though they are operating the parking authority garages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.522" offset="8594808">Also in the City of Pittsburgh, there is a mercantile tax imposed on wholesale and retail vendors of merchandise at the right of 1 mill.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.278" offset="8677878">The amount imposed on this people is 34 and a third times more than any other business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.469" offset="8706612">On exhibit 3, you will note that the mercantile tax in 1969 obtained for the city is $2 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.402" offset="11618325">We have in Pittsburgh another public authority called the Auditorium Authority and there the authority that built the Three Rivers Stadium and also our civic arena and they have in turn, the Auditorium Authority for example has leased the parking space to the public parking authority itself and the authority in turn has leased it to one of this plaintiffs, Alco Parking to operate for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.210" offset="11721561">So, in addition to the normal parking authority spaces in the downtown central location of Pittsburgh, the Three Rivers Stadium Authority which I think is over 2000 to 3000 spaces is also run by a public authority leasing to the parking authority and there are other public bodies doing the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.348" offset="11930122">I would like to say Your Honor that this Court on many occasions has not hesitated to declare a taking where the police power has been exercised, and I am thinking of cases like Pennsylvania against Maine and United States against -- cases like Pennsylvania against Maine and other cases which we have cited in our brief dealing with the regulations of the police power, also cases like US versus Causby, the airline cases, Griggs versus Allegheny County and the case of Armstrong against the United States where this Court determined that the immunity of suit privilege given to the United States does not protect it against a claim of a mechanics lien holder.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.675" offset="13511471">A parking rate of say 5% or 6 mills or 10 mills or 10% plus the competition might not be a taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="3377.420" offset="13586390">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.122" offset="13605198">With respect to the question of this Court reviewing the facts, you stated in Fiske versus Kansas City, this Court will review the finding of fact by State Court where a conclusion of law as to a federal right and a finding of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary in order to pass upon the federal question to analyze the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.861" offset="13696209">Furthermore, it is really incorrect to state that the majority of the State Court found that the tax could not be passed on in the form of a price increase because the four three decision, Justice Egan concurred in the result only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.329" offset="13778024">So I don't think you can infer necessarily that Justice Egan, excuse me justice O’Bryan concurring in the result also concurred in the conclusion that the tax could not be passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.450" offset="13826508">I think it is only fair to say that three of the justices of the seven justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that the tax could not be passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.319" offset="13881992">References that made to the inability to persuade the authority to raise rates after the tax was increased, there is nothing in this record to show that any approach was made to the parking authority and then a request for rate relief was refused, nothing in this record on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.264" offset="13977809">With respect to the confiscation and the growth of the authority into the private area at the time of Magellic in 1964, that case was a case stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.249" offset="14033711">And among the stipulated facts were that there were in existence at at time 5,100 authority spaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.713" offset="14067566">And now in 1970 in September at the time of trial in this case, there were existent 6,100 spaces, hardly a record of a wildly spawning authority operation at the expense of private industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.673" offset="14139455">Reference is made to Professor Sax and I think it should be clear from a reading of the majority opinion that great weight is placed upon the opinions of Professor Sax about government acting in an entrepreneurial capacity rather than as an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.117" offset="14201208">Instead of showing nothing in a later article, Professor Sax states and I quote, “I am compelled however to disown the view that whenever government can be said to be acquiring resources for its own account compensation must be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.122" offset="14265260">I now view the problem as considerably more complex.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.050" offset="14280934">So, we have a decision where Professor Sax wrote originally that his opinions did not square up with the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.354" offset="14314162">The court below and the majority opinion adopts Professor Sax’s theory even though they do not square up with the decisions of this Court, and now, Professor Sax disowns his theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.793" offset="14371944">With respect to the question of whether or not supply exceeds demand, Mr. McNeal, a witness for the respondents was asked what is the shortage?</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.805" offset="14423980">There is a present deficiency of about 4,100 spaces in the survey area, that is in downtown Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.705" offset="14459611">That is the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.512" offset="14462746">That is in the Central Business District which will increase to approximately 7,500 spaces based on developments that are currently under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.474" offset="14562638">Reference is made to the exhibit in the respondent’s brief on page 48A and I think this illustrates the point the petitioner makes with respect to the quality of the evidence presented in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.202" offset="14625541">There, Justice Cramer of the Commonwealth Court in his dissent put in tabular form the findings that the engineer had compiled to show the income versus expenses of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.366" offset="14690220">And if you look at that exhibit to see how easy it is to manipulate this type of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.876" offset="14712268">The first seven companies the record shows are owned by one man -- one man on seven companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.770" offset="14739853">The first two companies show losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.610" offset="14751138">Dropping down to the fifth company, it shows a profit of 16,126 and then another company shows a loss of 5,384.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.000" offset="14784784">So, if you combine companies one, two and five with company number four -- one, two and six with company number five, two of the unprofitable operations in this study would be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.367" offset="14838178">And the remaining one would still be profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.014" offset="14848836">So, evidence like this clearly are subject to manipulation.</text>
