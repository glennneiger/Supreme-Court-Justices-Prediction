            <label>Mr. Leonard Mellon</label>
            <text syncTime="47.783" offset="267912">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.403" offset="286407">I am the Assistant State Attorney in Florida and I represent the petitioner here, Richard E. Gerstein the State Attorney in the Judicial Circuit of Florida for Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.500" offset="334785">Petitioner was the appellant below and one of the defendants at trial in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.177" offset="373447">We are here on a petition for writ of certiorari to review the August 15th, 1973 decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in which, that Court held in affirming the United States District Court from the Southern District of Florida that the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States mandated that preliminary hearings be given for all persons being held in custody even in instances where they are charged by an information filed by a state attorney in which he has certified that there is probable cause to hold those persons in custody pending trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.582" offset="583053">The respondents, at the time of the initiation of this litigation where defendants, then in custody in the Dade County Jail, charged with various crimes: felonies and misdemeanors, charged by information or information which had there before had been filed by the Dade County State Attorney, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.473" offset="718681">In the class actions, they asked that the District Court declare and mandatorily compel the Dade County Circuit Court to grant them a preliminary hearing on the charges then pending against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.166" offset="809378">The United States District Court, in its ruling, held among other things that these defendants were entitled under the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, to a preliminary hearing even though they had been charged in an information in which the state attorney had certified the issue of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.418" offset="934452">We are here confronted with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.589" offset="955141">Do persons in state custody, charged under information in which there has been a certification as to probable cause by the prosecuting attorney that is the State attorney, do they have a right to a preliminary hearing before a magistrate on that question of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.126" offset="1033300">Throughout this litigation, the petitioner has relied on a line of cases by this court beginning with Ker versus California in which this Court held that a man need not be charged by a grand jury indictment but can, in fact, be charged by information.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.318" offset="1146044">Lem Woon versus Oregon has been argued throughout this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.068" offset="1169032">This Court has held that no prior probable cause hearing is necessary prior to the making of an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.569" offset="1218978">We relied especially on this Court’s language in Ocampo versus United States in 234 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.028" offset="1260878">There, it was held that the function of determining probable cause is only quasi-judicial and, therefore, that function need not be confided to a strictly judicial officer or tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.805" offset="1351993">This Court, in recent years, in its decision in Shadwick versus Tampa, for example, held that a magistrate must meet two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.575" offset="1415001">First, that he’d be neutral and detached and the second that he’d be capable of determining probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.860" offset="1468186">When this Court held in Coolidge versus New Hampshire that the very Attorney General who would act as a magistrate in the issuance of a search warrant, that Attorney General who had been the Chief Investigator in the case leading up to the application for a search warrant and who would be the Chief Prosecutor did not have the degree of neutrality and detachment necessary in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.181" offset="1629518">We submit that we are not here confronted with a similar situation to Coolidge versus New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.766" offset="1671837">A state attorney in Florida and the state attorney in this instance, the petitioner, in his determination as to whether or not there are sufficient facts to file an information has a degree of neutrality and certainly has a degree of detachment for he does not make the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.350" offset="1758145">The case is brought to him by a law enforcement agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.906" offset="1776327">He sits, in effect, at the juncture in the proceeding in a quasi-judicial capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.251" offset="1809763">Mr. Mellon, I wonder if I can interrupt you to ask you if you can help me get cleared the chronology of how this happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.071" offset="1849051">Is there, first, an arrest by a policeman presumably, at least as far as this case goes, a valid arrest because no arrest is being attacked in this case and then, the policeman comes to the prosecutor, the county, and gives him the case that he thinks he has against the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.071" offset="1933061">Then, the prosecutor files the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.595" offset="1943092">Or, does the information come first and then is followed by an arrest?</text>

            <text syncTime="471.222" offset="1961587">It occurs both ways, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.027" offset="1980813">In the majority of cases in our jurisdiction in Florida, in Dade County, are warrantless arrests where the officer comes upon the scene and makes an arrest on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.701" offset="2043507">In that case, the information is filed subsequent to the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.928" offset="2160431">And, the initial appearance is held that conforms to your rule, Rule 5, must be held within 24 hours after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.409" offset="2210377">But, the majority of cases are of a warrantless variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.627" offset="2227304">On the other hand, there are instances where a police officer comes to the State Attorney’s Office, testifies to the state attorney or his assistant as to the nature of his case and, thereafter, a warrant, a habeas or warrant is issued when an information is filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.772" offset="6843873">Three rulings that were decided by the Court of Appeals disturbs Florida in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.864" offset="6872189">Number one is that they held a rule which exempted misdemeanors from preliminary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.295" offset="6901969">It was a deprivation of equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.990" offset="6916702">Second, they said the delay in holding a preliminary hearing in a capital case or in what Florida calls a life felony case, on the one hand, with general felonies on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.072" offset="6976993">Now, let me back up so the Court understands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.101" offset="6985143">If it’s a capital or a life felony, we have seven days within which to inform or indict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.137" offset="7009280">If it is a normal felony, we have four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.182" offset="7021505">The Court of Appeals held there was no rational basis to classify these different crimes and have these different periods, and that it constituted a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.054" offset="7068944">The Third, of course, was that we had to mandatorily have preliminary hearings notwithstanding the filing of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.135" offset="7101336">Now, all of this of course is of interest to the State of Florida because these are rules of statewide applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.534" offset="7126936">Insofar as the misdemeanant are concerned, the misdemeanant petitioner in this case is charged with, first, possession of marijuana, case bail of 60 days, $500 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.761" offset="7179807">Rule 5 of this Court exempts from preliminary hearings heavy offenders, 6 months, $500 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.473" offset="7214602">So, I would submit to this Court that the Court of Appeals is either wrong or this Court’s rule is unconstitutional because you are, in fact, discriminating between a petty offender and a felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.546" offset="7270922">That’s quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.803" offset="7275938">I think it is vivid and I think the opinion must follow this Court’s rule in this fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.594" offset="7299135">The second one, the delayed hearing, I think really misses the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.516" offset="7314808">There is a rational basis to classify these two crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.552" offset="7334975">Under our rule, it’s Rule 3.130, first appearance, we got to show, in a capital case or a life felony, presumption great, proof evident or he has a right to bail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.162" offset="13265398">What we have there is a very practical kind of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.376" offset="13278250">I cannot concede that there is absolutely pure Fourth Amendment probable cause there because neither the state attorney nor the arresting officer is a neutral and detached person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.007" offset="13316807">But as a practical matter, there is -- we are willing to have the state attorney or a police officer decide that there’s probable cause and make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.869" offset="13360274">Otherwise, what we’d be asking for would be a prior to arrest determination of probable cause and we don’t ask that because that would be a ridiculous request to invite possible defendants in to see if they’re going to be arrested sometime in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.567" offset="13418998">It would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.521" offset="13422864">So obviously, when the balancing process takes place, you have to allow the arresting officer to make that quasi determination of probable cause or the state attorney perhaps, making a similar quasi determination of probable cause, neither are neutral and detached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.670" offset="13483468">What we’re seeking is to test that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.344" offset="13494126">And so, it is a flexible kind of think we’re asking after the taking of liberty, an opportunity to test that determination that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.111" offset="13521189">And that is a Fourteenth Amendment request that we’re making and I think it’s interesting to note that the state attorney is not neutral and detached not only under the Fourth Amendment but under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.336" offset="13566119">In Morrissey versus Brewer, the Court talked about one of the essential elements of a due process hearing is to have that hearing conducted by a neutral and detached person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.543" offset="13598929">And, we submit that the state attorney, the Chief Prosecuting Officer, certainly in not neutral and detached under the Fourteenth Amendment and of course, in the decisions of this Court in Coolidge versus New Hampshire and Chadwick versus City of Tampa, he’s certainly not neutral and detached under the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4197.191" offset="16865489">It reminds me of the fact that John Peter Zenger, when he was sought to be prosecuted by the crown twice, they sought indictments and twice they failed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4215.597" offset="16939154">But, we take no position on that and this record does not accord the Court an opportunity to get to that question because there is no showing that indictments do not really protect the individual.</text>
