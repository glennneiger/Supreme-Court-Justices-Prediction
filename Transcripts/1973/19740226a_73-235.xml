            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="77824">We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1454, excuse me, 72-235, DeFunis against Odegaard.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.192" offset="346572">Mr. Diamond.</text>

            <label>Mr. Josef Diamond</label>
            <text syncTime="68.517" offset="351796">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.053" offset="385964">The plaintiffs, petitioners rather, brought this action for the reason that Marco DeFunis, Jr. was, on two occasions, wrongfully denied admission to the law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.903" offset="437373">Now, we do not contend that mathematical grades alone were the sole admission criteria employed by the law school, but the record is clear that, taking all criteria in account, in the law school’s own judgment its minority program resulted into the admission of minority students less qualified than non-minority students who were rejected particularly because there appears to be some misconception of the facts by many of the amici briefs, and possibly also the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.766" offset="580838">I’d like to discuss a little bit of the background and the factual situation with reference to Marco DeFunis.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.011" offset="613857">At the time we agreed to represent Marco DeFunis, we had not met him and knew very little about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.195" offset="642591">From the facts related to us, in which we were later able to verify, we were certain that there was something wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.125" offset="674252">Marco attended grade school and high school in Seattle, was graduated from the University of Washington as an honor student in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.127" offset="718242">He received Phi Beta Capa, Magna Cum Laude, and notwithstanding the fact that he had worked 20-40 hours a week all the time that he was in college as manual labor for the Park Department of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.098" offset="774144">He also taught Sunday school.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.432" offset="783548">He had a Junior-Senior grade point average of 3.71 out of a possible 4 as calculated by the law school, or a 3.8 when you include 9 hours of straight-A he received in Latin in the first quarter of his Junior year in the summer of 1968, which the law school would not, for some reason, consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.302" offset="874977">In 1971, after he had been rejected by the law school and advised that if he tried again the following year there might be room for him, he went to graduate school at the same University of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.216" offset="930670">He took 24 hours of graduate work, again working 30-40 hours a week with the Park Department, and he turned in grades of 21 hours of A.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.515" offset="975809">At the time of his application, there were 3 hours of incomplete because he hadn’t got the grades as yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.152" offset="1002350">He had taken the law school admissions test on three occasions and received scores of 512, 566, and 568, and had writing scores of 62, 58, and 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.281" offset="1058879">The law school aptitude test of 668, which is the final one he took, was within the top 7% of all law school applicants across the nation who had ever taken it in the past several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.741" offset="1124707">For DeFunis as well as all other applicants, the Junior-Senior grade point averages and the LSAT scores were combined, using a formula to arrive to what was referred to as a predicted first year average, which in DeFunis’ case, was 76.23.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.971" offset="1193671">He had little money, and his wife worked as a dental assistant to help him through school and he was also helped by his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.099" offset="1222196">He didn’t know why he was denied admission to the law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.753" offset="1236825">We didn’t know what his religion was, nor his race, nor whether he belonged to a so-called minority group, nor what constituted a minority group.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.653" offset="1268381">We didn’t think it mattered what his religion was or whether he was Black, Red, or White.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.506" offset="1291786">It was inconceivable to us that an honor student with the grades that he has: Phi Beta Capa, Magna Cum Laude, from the same university would not be qualified and would be denied admission to the university law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.792" offset="1348942">To us, it wasn’t possible that all those who were being admitted were better qualified than DeFunis.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.337" offset="1391156">We first met with the Dean of the law school and inquired “what was the basis of denial,” he had the Chairman of the Admissions Committee?</text>
            <text syncTime="337.057" offset="1425951">The only answer we could get was that there were other students better qualified than DeFunis.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.137" offset="1450297">We told him we couldn’t accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.117" offset="1458239">We had to see something to verify that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.013" offset="1473808">The records were confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.565" offset="1480077">Even though we said we weren’t interested in names, just records to establish that there were 150 or more better qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.193" offset="1514559">“No, that was confidential matters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="361.277" offset="1522918">We next appeared and met with the Board of Regents, took his parents with us, I don’t think we took the boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.447" offset="1555519">Again, Board of Regents listened and said they would let us know, advised us that “no,” they were going to stand by the decision made by the Dean of the law School and the Admissions Committee, and that there was no room for Marco DeFunis.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.354" offset="1623228">We had no any alternative after he’d been denied twice, but to bring a lawsuit, and it was only after litigation was started and during pretrial discovery in the taking of depositions and in fact only during the trial itself that we’re able to get a Court order requiring the university to produce the files and the records of some of those who were being admitted, and we had to look at them during the noon hour because the trial was in process and the Court ordered them to be brought down to the Courtroom, but not all 1,500 or 1,600.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.919" offset="1769409">We settled for about 300 or 400 and during the noon hour, we went through those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.897" offset="1793337">And, the record here will show you what we found when we went through them and we put them in evidence is who they were taking into the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.307" offset="1835029">Now, what the university admissions class really did, they admitted two classes, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.281" offset="1878915">They took the non-minority group and they looked at their grades, and we’re not saying they looked only at their grades but what else was there to look at?</text>
            <text syncTime="460.228" offset="1918725">There were no personal interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.670" offset="1928443">They looked at their grades, and the file they had the grades, honors, recommendations, everybody had a recommendation that they produced, the application of the student, and that’s about all.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.272" offset="1978911">And, they determined, the Chairman of the Committee, that anybody who had a predicted first year average of 77 would automatically be admitted with a few exceptions, most of those came in later, and they actually admitted those too.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.495" offset="2035754">So, everyone who had a 77 or higher are automatically admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.537" offset="2055920">Then, they took the next list and anyone that were 75 -- 74.5, they were automatically eliminated with the exception of the minorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.027" offset="2725909">Now, the -- as they singled out the minorities, they were not thrown out if they were below 74.5, and we find that minorities were admitted with grades like 69.7, 67.14 compared to DeFunis with a 76.23, when 77 would’ve admitted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.749" offset="2824756">Now, the -- in determining that the Black-Americans and the Chicanos and the Filipino-Americans and the American-Indians were minority applicants, there wasn’t any determine -- actually, what constitute and how would you determine that you were a Black-American or you were a Chicano?</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.261" offset="9890774">We feel that, in connection with these particular minorities, the fact of discrimination against them in our society over literally hundreds of years has had a very real effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.158" offset="10002369">So that if we used only these mathematical determinants of admission for law school, we would continue to exclude them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.811" offset="10060988">Even on a statistical basis, coupled with other background items not related to race at all, they were qualified and they’ve shown themselves to be qualified.</text>
