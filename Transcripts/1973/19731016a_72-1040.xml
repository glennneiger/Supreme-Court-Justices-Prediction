            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="17.151" offset="150465">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.593" offset="164258">This appeal brings before the court a challenge to a provision of the Indiana Election Law that contained conditions political party access to the ballot on the making on a disclaimer that the party does not advocate overthrow of government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.045" offset="250044">Plaintiff’s tendered signatures on petitions for inclusion on the ballot, on August 31st, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.976" offset="293721">The defendants, the Election Board of Indiana rejected the petitions the same day, relying on the provision of Indiana law and an opinion rendered on August 28 by the Indiana Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.192" offset="362684">The statute specifically provides that the affidavit must state the party does not advocate the overthrow of local state or national government by force or violence and that it is not affiliated with and does not cooperate with nor has any relation with any foreign government or political party or group of individuals of any foreign government.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.888" offset="461427">The opinion of the attorney general took the statute a step or so further stating as to the particular appellants, the party appellants, the Communist Party of Indiana that “this Communist Party would not be eligible to appear on the Indiana ballot even if its officers should sign an affidavit because that would be an obvious perjury in view of the communist party stated purposes and those Indiana officials who would be responsible for placing the communist party on the ballot could be subject to federal criminal prosecution, as well under the Smith Act and the Communist Control Act, somewhat (Inaudible).”</text>
            <text syncTime="142.683" offset="652643">The plaintiffs in this action, the Communist Party of Indiana, the candidates for the presidency and vice presidency under that banner, candidates for electors of the president and the vice president under that banner, a voter and the class of voter she would represent sued for injunctive and declaratory relief against the enforcement of this Indiana Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.967" offset="761731">The amended complaint which is the basic document before the court was filed on September 8th, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.690" offset="788584">A hearing was held on September 28th, 1972 and a decision was conducted on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.343" offset="827246">Three-judge district court in Indiana ruled that the affiliation clause of the statute, the statute prohibiting affiliation with a foreign government or a segment thereof, was on constitution on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.648" offset="880431">It on the other hand specifically validated the advocacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.816" offset="901120">The communist party as a consequence of this action and a consequence of the fact that it had very limited time in which to get on the ballot, or to take steps to get on the ballot for the 1972 election, submitted a qualified affidavit, pursuing to the order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.194" offset="974681">In that affidavit the party stated by its officers that it did not engage in the unlawful advocacy or the prescribed advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.657" offset="1016477">It went on to state concerned obviously with the opinion of the attorney general about the perjury sanctions that the term advocate used here in has the meaning given by the supreme court of the United States in Yates, “the advocacy and teaching of concrete action for the forcible overthrow of government and not of principles divorced from actions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="260.628" offset="1124415">So affidavit was tendered and rejected by the election board on September 29th by a vote of 2:1.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.817" offset="1157120">Thereafter the plaintiffs went back to the district court, requested an order enforcing the previous mandate of the court, that order was denied on October 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.772" offset="1216993">A motion to amend subsequently made was denied on October 31st and various attempts by the appellants here and appellees on the other side were also rejected in an emergency posture by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.274" offset="1290971">Both sides then took appeals from the two different decisions of the three judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.347" offset="1323259">On March 19, 1973, this court summarily affirmed the decision of the three judge district court to the extent that that court had invalidated the affiliation clause of the Indiana Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.138" offset="1390446">The same time, the instant case, the appeal by the communist party, its candidates and voters, the court entered an order stating that the question of jurisdiction has been postponed to the hearing of the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.594" offset="1464216">Now what appellants take to be the question of jurisdiction in this case, at this point, after all the emergency appeals had been rendered and after the various actions have been taken in the district court is the question of the timeliness of the appeal and I would like to rest, so far as that question is concerned on the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.459" offset="1551673">We brief that extensively, possibly too extensively but since the question was reserved and this was the question that appeared to us to be the jurisdictional question, we had briefed that from pages 13 to 15 in the appellant's brief and unless the court desire specific argument on that issue, I would rest on the brief and turn to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.487" offset="1663791">Plaintiff’s request to this court to reverse and remand through the district court with instructions to void the advocacy provision of the Indiana statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.596" offset="1708304">We have a number of arguments which I think we have fairly extensively briefed but it might be helpful to go over them in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.641" offset="1740382">Our first point concerns the nature of voting a standing for public office and of political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.973" offset="1789806">These are clearly fundamental interests, enumerable decisions of this court have stated that the right to vote is the fountainhead of democratic rights in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.478" offset="1839752">In the Bullock and Carter decision the court indicated that the rights of the candidacy are so bound up with the right to vote that they are basically inseparable, and of course in Williams and Rhodes, and other decisions the court has indicated its extreme sensitivity to the need of the candidates and voters to be affiliated with the political parties that are able to place on the ballot of a state or of a national election.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.237" offset="1958766">Candidates who are sponsored and clearly stated to be sponsored by given political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.953" offset="1997636">To this extent then, this case involves what the court has characterized as fundamental interests and it renders this case, this appeal different from the cases in which the court has evaluated oaths in other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.057" offset="2066077">This is different from an employment oath context, it is different from a bar admission context.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.610" offset="2096274">In neither of those other context, you have the interest that is being withheld as a result of the oath, achieve the kind of fundamental interest that this court has this fine voting and candidacy and political association.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.510" offset="2155938">The interest itself, the vote, the candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.365" offset="2171298">In those cases you have had a situation in which an interest admittedly a valuable interest, has been conditioned upon the giving of an oath or an affidavit, and evaluating the oath or affidavit, the court has been looking however, so far as the constitutional dimension is concerned only at the oath or the affidavit itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.972" offset="2253740">Here you have to look at both, both have First Amendment dimensions, the vote, the candidacy and all, and also the affidavit, involves a First Amendment dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.823" offset="2305149">Now we submit with this context set of the primacy of voting that the state has an enormous burden of the persuasion of the necessity, for any limitation upon voting or candidacy particularly a limitation that may encroach itself upon First Amendment rights, by enquiring into political motivation or ideology of a candidate or a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.997" offset="2425835">The state has no such legitimate, nor even nor certainly compelling interest in so conditioning voting and candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.098" offset="2474214">State on one or another has spoken a fraud and spurious candidacies, well it is a little late in the day for anybody to be suggesting that the efforts of the communist party of Indiana or of the United States to place candidates before the electorate are fraudulent or spurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.780" offset="2552999">It is a political party, it has been a political party in this country for enumerable years, and it has fielded candidates for Ohio office throughout most of the years that it has been a party in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.983" offset="2605767">Subversion, the state points to or the avoidance of subversion as being a legitimate and compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.735" offset="2628859">Indeed that is a legitimate interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.059" offset="2638054">Obviously the state has an interest in avoiding its subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.513" offset="2651951">So does the national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.692" offset="2660624">Well it is a compelling interest in this context is much more open to doubt, we think actually it is not open to doubt, it is not a compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.331" offset="2691239">The state is asking an oath three steps away from office taking itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.918" offset="2725512">To get on the ballot, you have to execute the oath, to get to the point where you can subvert the government from within, if that is the state’s interest in, and I can't conceive of another interest that the state might have and categorize it as legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.534" offset="2787997">To get to the point of subverting the government, you got to win the election, and then the government by the constitution, Article 6 and Article 2, can certainly give the support oath and screen out people who can not take the support oath before office taking occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.468" offset="2879739">So this oath is placed in to steps before office taking, it is quite an enormous offense, the state is placing around its interest in avoiding subversion.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="712.238" offset="2930834">What do you understand the meaning of the phrase compelling interest to be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="718.746" stopTime="792.236">
            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="718.746" offset="2956852">As I understand it to mean the state has to come forward with an interest that-- I don’t want to use the term outbalances, well I think the court's analysis in the Robel case of how legislation is to evaluated in terms of compelling interest is perhaps is the most apt, as I recall it was in a footnote, in the Robel case that the court discussed the fact that it wasn’t talking about balancing as such, it recognized on the one hand that freedom of speech is an important interest to our society and our government.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.791" offset="3097078">On the other hand avoidance of subversion in sabotage is an important interest as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.835" offset="3121215">When these two come at one another, seem to be in conflict then the court must fall back to a somewhat different analysis and not try to balance one against the other necessarily but to try to evaluate whether the state has or the government has some alternative ways of securing the legitimate interest which is compelling and in that case as you recall Justice Stewart, the court ruled that the federal government didn’t demonstrated lacked alternative ways and in this case too.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="792.236" stopTime="812.034">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="792.236" offset="3250782">Now that’s the availability of alternative means as it is something else, but I did not mean that, my question was an easy one, because I was really asking for information by the way and for help, what do you think the phrase compelling interest means constitutionally?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="812.034" stopTime="893.055">
            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="812.034" offset="3329985">Alright, constitutionally I think it first means that a burden of proof is shifted, a burden of constitutional proof, whereas initially one who comes in to challenge a state law, has the burden of demonstrating that the state law is bad, wholly on his or her shoulders, when you establish a fundamental interest or if you are dealing with the equal protect clause of course of suspect classification, then the burden of proof shifts. First the burden of going forward, if you want to talk in evidentiary terms shifts to the government to come up with some legitimate reasons, some reasons that go beyond mere rationality which would be the ordinary standard to be applied in the equal protection or the due process area.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.104" offset="3518276">Now having come up with these legitimate reasons when the court states that these reasons not only are to be legitimate but also must be compelling, it seems to me the court is either talking about a balancing test which some members of the court don’t view with favor or it is talking about police restrictive alternative test and in either event it still and also pertains I think to a burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.326" offset="3639171">It has now become the burden of proof question rather the burden of going forward question.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="893.055" stopTime="910.623">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="893.055" offset="3654113">Do you think the phrase or the concept or the notion of whatever that phrase may mean or reflect compelling interests has any relevance at all in any area outside of the area of the equal protection clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="910.623" offset="3724330">Yes, I think so I think Robel indicates that it has some relevance outside of that area, I know that it first originated in the equal protection clause but as it seems to me in the later decisions of the court to be something of a spillover into a First Amendment area because of the parallelity in the two tests--</text>

            <text syncTime="930.701" offset="3804682">Of course the state, anyways this is semantics but it seems to me a little more than that and a little more fundamental than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.538" offset="3840000">If a state law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendment clearly, then a state can just justify that violation by showing its compelling interest, can it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.762" offset="6852963">The company may Your Honor, or the chief counsel of my office Mr. Shaldon Bresko(ph), Assistant Attorney General Darrel K. Diamond and one of the name defendants Mr. Karl Steifer(ph)of Indianapolis was the member of the bar at this court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.989" offset="6913776">The matter of Jurisdictional question which the court has is reserved, we too passed to our brief on pages five and six and would differ on that and prefer to argue on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.349" offset="6967275">State of Indiana as represented by its Indiana General Assembly and as upheld by the Indiana Supreme Court decided long ago that in conformance with the cases of this court that the state has a right of self reservation and that in balancing the rights of all of the amendments of the constitutions that this court has never held at the First Amendment right are absolute or that any rights are absolute, that there has to be a balancing of the rights and the history of Indiana would show that we have had difficulties and as the reading of our oath would imply, our oath as it has been trimmed down by the Federal court below and which we defend is to the effect that the political parties or political groups seeking the official status of political parties must have their officers sign this oath and submit it along with their petitions to the state elections board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.952" offset="7205721">Now our law applies to all political parties unlike the Ohio law and Gilligan which this court ruled upon last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.227" offset="7238740">Our law applies to republicans, democrats and every other party before they get on initially and then each year but there is an election they are required by the same law to submit a statement in that platform officially staying the substance of this same oath and all parties which get on the ballot, including the Socialist Labor Party and Socialist Workers Party and the others, the Peace and the Freedom Party in 1972 so complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.984" offset="7341767">But all that we ask now is that these party official state that they do not advocate the overthrow of local, State or National Government by force or violence and besides the history of the thing which would show you some background in Indiana's consideration here, we have the feeling, as expressed so well, by Mr. Chief Justice Burger in Cole v. Richardson case that seems, there is no constitutionally protected right to overthrow our government by force, violence or illegal or unconstitutional means, no constitutional right is infringed by an oath to abide by the constitutional system in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.472" offset="7531729">Our feeling is that once you pass the threshold of moving from the college or the coffee klatch or the power discussion into the status of an official political party where you are recognized by the State and start off with an equal opportunity, no matter what the odds are, taken over the reigns of government that the State has the right to ask you to abide by the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.805" offset="7641130">Once you cross that threshold.You move from potential to kinetic in terms of the battle for political power and the Indiana law is clear, it is continuing, it applies to all political parties, reasonable men can understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.942" offset="7709675">There are no criminal penalties attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.505" offset="7719915">Appellants' counsel refers to an official opinion of the Attorney General to the election board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.864" offset="7741336">Official opinions of the Attorney General in Indiana are not the official construction of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.065" offset="7762129">The construction of the law in Indiana is by the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.010" offset="7777907">All official opinions in Indiana are merely advisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.128" offset="7790341">The Attorney General of Indiana has to general criminal powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.705" offset="7804656">All he is doing in that opinion was stating a fact, upon reading the communist platform as circulated in Indiana and reading the fact that they failed to take the oath, he was stating the fact, that of they did take fields as they state in here, that they might not be telling the truth, they might be semantics to disguise their actual advocacy of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.648" offset="7896503">If I may refer to page 32 A of the Appendix prepared by appellants in which they state, in their petition of October 3, submitted to the court below, “In order to make it perfectly clear to the State Election Board, the court and the citizens of Indiana, that said party, the Communist Party, was not conjuring itself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.331" offset="7991171">The last sentences said, affidavits was attached and that last sentence was that qualification with reference to a statement taken out of context in Yates and then the statement in that same paragraph, thus the plaintiff Communist Party can with the clear conscious signed, attached affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.073" offset="8062119">In other words, they reserved the right, they impliedly admit that they do advocate the violent overthrow of the government, but they reserve the right to specify the time and the place and the method.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.984" offset="8265770">That is if a rule presents a petition and with the requisite number of signed registered voters and presents the affidavit, the State Election Board must receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.889" offset="8309447">The law also states, that the State Election Board shall then, make an investigation after the accuracy of the petitions which it had no opportunity to do here, because of the time element and as to abreast of the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.672" offset="8368588">It provides no criminal penalties, however, and the only action it can take at that point, if it finds either the affidavit is wrong, as it did in another case and did in this case or that the petitions are insufficient, it just rejects the party's position on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.129" offset="8430341">In 1968, the same issue came up before the Indiana Supreme Court, Socialist Labor Party versus State Election Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.103" offset="9058325">This Court has upheld, a loyalty oath in Pennsylvania for political candidates in Lisker in 1971, where the loyalty oath was much more loosely worded, it's something to the -- read something to the affect that the potential candidate was not a subversive person, whatever that would be and then again in the Gerende case in 1951 where it upheld the oath in Maryland for political candidates, where they stated they were not engaged in one way or another in activities of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.416" offset="9187579">The Healy case in 1971 involving the STS, this Court made a statement, a holding, I believe that recognition may be denied to any group which reserves the right to violate any valid rule with which it disagrees and that is our contention here, that by they do it yourself oath or customize oath, appellants presented through the Federal Court below, which rejected it, by the way, that they are attempting to reserve the right to engage in this action and therefore, their oath is not valid, they are performing, and if at all, with a mental reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2449.108" offset="9878256">But I thought perhaps Mr. Justice like many of the state legislator of Indiana where we have such an oath it would be fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.850" offset="9905319">It would encompass the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.699" offset="9920679">The -- in Cole versus Richardson the words to oppose the overthrow in my opinion are not different from not to advocate the overthrow, substantially the same and I am thinking does one have the right to advocate that which he has a constitutional duty to oppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.060" offset="10002077">In the very Fourteenth Amendment I would like to refer you to the Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment which is I rarely discussed where a discretionary oath really takes place, where it says using the negative to begin with, “No person shall be an elector or other official or hold any public office, I put the word public in there, any office who haven't previously taken an oath to support the constitution of the United States shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.301" offset="10135092">There must have been the same discussion at that time for the obvious reasons and this would go back to the background as to why Indiana perhaps adopted this oath when it did in view of the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.173" offset="10178560">The case of ex parte Milligan with which this Court is well squinted besides the ruling on habeas corpus, the factual background was that Mr. Milligan was one of those who engaged with southern sympathizers in overthrowing several local units of government and when General Morgan's raiders and others came in they actually took over for a period of days local units of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.494" offset="10267794">We had the same thing in Indiana's background in the sense during the 1920s and 30s with the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and we also had during the 1930s and up to World War II very radical areas as between the German American Bund and the Communist Party in Indiana and these things caused the legislature -- legislature of Indiana during the height of the war to pass this law and to apply for all political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.810" offset="10389107">That's a legislative background on that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.412" offset="10399556">As to counsel for opponents reference to Brandenburg, Yates, Noto and those cases, they are criminal cases and heavy much more strict standard of proof in the civil matter such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.773" offset="10456921">If we had to set up our standard we would say that in Indiana following the construction of the Indiana Supreme Court that the advocacy has to be linked to action and that you cannot reserve the right to take violent action if you are going across the threshold and become officially recognized as a political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.804" offset="10565068">The one other thing Mr. Chief Justice I would like to refer to is the very platform of the Communist Party itself which is copyright in May 1970, Library of Congress no. 79-127023 and circulated throughout the country, including Indiana and as I mentioned earlier a voter in the state of Indiana who is properly registered could vote in 1972 by an examination of these platforms for everything for which the Communist Party stood except one, he could not vote in Indiana for those candidates who advocate or refuse to say they don't advocate the overthrow of the government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.075" offset="10750119">But the Communist Party goes on to say, if I may quote very briefly in point, that their campaign for their rights free from all social and legal restrictions, page 61, page 64, “We communists are not pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.500" offset="10835905">We leave violence from the class standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.384" offset="10847399">Accordingly we regard non-violence as a tactic of struggle in some instances but we do not adhere to it as a principle or a philosophy” and then on page 93, “Speaking about whether or not there would have to be a bloody ordeal or whether they could assume power through the electoral process without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.117" offset="10930364">Yes of course we must be prepared to meet any eventuality while we seek a peaceful path as preferable to a violent one, this choice may prove to be blocked by manipulatory action, socialism must be sought therefore by whatever means the circumstances may impose” and then finally in the words that they italicize are the words I will emphasize, “The very development of present day struggles lays the basis for making clear now the need to change the system and for building now the movement for socialism in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.098" offset="11066305">He who does not work for these goals now will never be prepared for revolutionary change.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.634" offset="11088353">So they are advocating action now which may prompt it to take some unlawful action as noted in Yates page 322, quoting Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.869" offset="11145300">I mentioned the cases interpreting our law in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.376" offset="11159406">Indiana Law is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.804" offset="11169123">It does not violate anyone's rights with respect to getting on the ballot if they will make a conscientious oath and effort and not reserve the right to overthrow the government by force or violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.037" offset="12089992">Second point I would like to make in rebuttal is, of course, I think that quoting from the 1950 Communist Party platform is totally irrelevant to the issues in this case on innumerable grounds that’s part of the record in the case, if it were, it would be stale on basis of many decisions to this Court involving Communist Party registration or prosecution so that it is obviously a sport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.656" offset="12188526">On over breadth, in addition to the cases already cited to the court, so far as the Indiana Supreme Court's interpretation of this or similar statutes is concerned, there is one case that had not been cited so far that State versus Levitt, 203 NE 2nd 821 (1965) in which the Indiana Supreme Court impliedly upheld the constitutionality of a broad submission statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.844" offset="12309211">Further so far as the Attorney General’s power to interpret and enforce law absent a definitive determination, the court's would agree, there is no literal power in Indiana law for him to bind officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.805" offset="12365113">However, he is certainly authorized by statute to issue advisory opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.303" offset="12391131">The election board specifically relied upon his opinion in coming it's determination and it would seem to us that the court's analysis in Wiegmann and Broderick just last term in terms of the powers and authority like the Attorney General pointed to interpret a statute would be of some relevance to a determination in this case.</text>
