            <text syncTime="19.899" offset="156317">In Richardson versus Ramirez, the three individual respondents in the case had been convicted of felonies and had completed the service of their sentences and paroles.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.087" offset="205113">When they sought to register to vote, county election officials in three California counties in which they resided, refused to register them because the California Constitution and implementing legislation prohibited voting by ex-felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.365" offset="274181">The individual respondents then brought this mandamus action in the Supreme Court of California against the election officials, individually and as representatives of the class of all such election officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.798" offset="323918">They claimed on behalf of themselves and all other ex-felon similarly situated that the California provisions disenfranchising ex-felons denied them equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.949" offset="388493">The California Supreme Court held that the challenged California constitutional and statutory provisions as applied to ex-felons whose sentences and paroles had expired did violate the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.136" offset="445336">We reverse that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.295" offset="453904">We hold first that in view of the unusual procedural history of this case in the Supreme Court of California, it is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.713" offset="483579">We further hold that the California does not violate the Equal Protection Clause by disenfranchising convicted felons who have completed their sentences and paroles.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.989" offset="528718">Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which contains the Equal Protection Clause could not have been meant to bar outright the disenfranchisement of felons when their disenfranchisement is expressly exempted by Section 2 of the same amendment from the less drastic sanction imposed by that Section for other forms of disenfranchisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.018" offset="616803">We further refer to contemporaneous historical materials illuminating understanding of the framers of the amendment in an opinion filed with the clerk today.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.848" offset="656091">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.194" offset="669571">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined and in Part 1 (a) of which Mr. Justice Douglas joins.</text>
