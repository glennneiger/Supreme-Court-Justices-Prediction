            <label>Mr. Duncan M. James</label>
            <text syncTime="89.899" offset="436349">Of the petitioner's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.307" offset="461949">It’s said to be 28 Lawyer's edition and it’s actually volume 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.388" offset="498312">And on the next page, page 5 in the parenthesis, it says James versus Bowman 190 US 124; the correct citation is 190 US 127.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.404" offset="570410">Also, I’d like to point out to the Court that in Mendocino County, we have somewhat of an inadequate law library and we only have Lawyers Editions and on page 4, the citation on page 4 is the United States versus Reese is referred to as being a note and apparently this is an editor’s note regarding the right of women to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.025" offset="672810">However, the opinion as quoted in the footnote on the page 5 is the portion of the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.997" offset="724741">What I’d like to do first I think is point out to the Court how a voter registers, at least in Mendocino County, California being a small rural county of the Northwestern part of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.364" offset="786181">Initially, the person desiring to register makes contact with the County Clerk or Deputy County Clerk and completes a form.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.315" offset="829962">That form appears in the appendix of the petitioner’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.888" offset="856294">One of the questions in the form is, “Have you ever been convicted of a felony?”</text>
            <text syncTime="199.523" offset="874789">If that box is checked yes, the person is given another form, a portion of which is filled out by the deputy registrar, and a portion of which is filled out by the person who has been convicted of that felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.584" offset="943125">The person who is convicted of a felony puts down the date of the conviction, the jurisdiction where the conviction took place and the offense for which he would he or she was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.118" offset="993176">That form is then forwarded to my office for my review.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.942" offset="1012506">Many times, I found in the past that the individuals completing the form would not give us adequate information.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.267" offset="1041868">And so, we’ve asked for all of that details so I can contact through the mails, the jurisdiction in which the person was convicted to get a certified copy of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.839" offset="1100069">After receiving the certified copy of the conviction are then proceed to make a determination under the California case Otsuka versus Hite which is 64 Cal, 2d 594 to determine whether or not that crime is infamous as well as taking into the consideration Article II, Section III of the California constitution, and Article XX, Section XII of the California constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.545" offset="1218978">Under those, the case of Otsuka notes two constitutional sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.980" offset="1240712">The basic crimes that we look to were murder, manslaughter, mayhem, rape, arson, robbery, burglary, larceny, embezzlement and misappropriation of public moneys, perjury, forgery, malfeasance in office and bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.161" offset="1321378">Prior to the Otsuka decision in California, any case which or any conviction which resulted in state prison sentence was considered infamous.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.633" offset="1371324">Otsuka modified that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.264" offset="1405806">Then sometimes on occasion, we find that the person has been convicted of an infamous crime and I complete the form to indicate whether or not a person is disqualified and I sign the form and that form is sent back to the individual who registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.134" offset="1489293">Now, in one instance in my county after having sent that form back, an action was brought against our County Clerk, Viola Richardson, by a fellow who happened to be named David Richardson and was no relation to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.450" offset="1558570">But also in that case, I was sued and so the case in the county was James versus -- Richardson versus James and Richardson, rather than Richardson versus Richardson because they did not want it to look like a divorce action and I was the cause of the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.473" offset="1626593">In that case, what transpired was the plaintiff proceeded under Section 350 of the California Elections Code, requesting the court make a determination as to whether or not his conviction was infamous.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.456" offset="1718544">He had spent about 18 months in state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.520" offset="1734844">I believe that conviction carries indeterminate term of six months to 10 years in California and the court in that case decided that under the Otsuka decision that that crime wasn’t that infamous and that Mr. Richardson wasn’t that disqualified from the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.690" offset="1839543">That case is presently pending in the California Court of Appeals by stipulation of counsel that it is awaiting the final determination in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.923" offset="3988480">I come with what I think is a difficult case in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.941" offset="4004467">Sociologically, everything is against our position in California because of the Otsuka decision is unquestionably true, then in 58 counties, you had 58 different interpretations of what was an infamous crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.482" offset="4086700">Historically, there is no question that a compelling state interest to protect the ballot box is no longer necessary at least and I agree with what the respondents have set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.783" offset="4151902">But the one thing that I come with is the constitution of the United States and that Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.137" offset="4201326">Now, I think that that is really the issue here is to whether or not this Court is going to take an area of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.236" offset="4249704">It’s implied, but it’s so clearly implied that it’s almost direct and say that this Court will say that sociologically, it’s good and consequently we should say that Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.208" offset="4337580">Now, as I see it, in reading the many pages of the globe, right in the beginning, everybody who ever mentioned the problem, except for rebellion or other crimes, did so in a matter of fact way because that was the accepted tenure of the time, but it was written into the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.783" offset="4455863">Unquestionably, the Fourteenth Amendment was to prevent all discrimination because of grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.619" offset="4491180">I don’t think there is any question of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.417" offset="4502465">But I think as you read this, to the people who worked down the Fourteenth Amendment wanted to be sure that the states still would have a little bit of a leverage where criminals are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.996" offset="4568712">Now, in California, we don’t say, they used to say in our constitution what the criminal be disenfranchised forever, and our constitution is now changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.107" offset="4617195">Justice Mosk in his opinion in the case below said that he didn’t think that was too important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.016" offset="4644780">But I think it is because our constitution now says that the legislature shall pass laws which will disenfranchise people for certain purposes and among those purposes named are perjury, bribery, malfeasance in office, embezzlement of public funds, and then they use language which I don’t understand anymore, infamous crime and high crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.943" offset="4772571">If this Court rules in our favor, in California, we will be back in the position that’s true that we were at the time of the Otsuka case right after or right (Inaudible) well, right after.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.829" offset="6776059">We were aware Your Honors that there would be a suggestion that perhaps this disability should continue by virtue of the fact that if it’s long existence and so although, the state we believe did not justify the burdens upon it to come forward and give a reasons for the exclusion, we went further and introduced evidence and data to we think clearly affirmatively show that this restriction which is adopted in California’s frontier days no longer make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.433" offset="6886504">As is discussed in our briefs and as has been almost conceded here, well, there might have been a purpose for this provision in 1849 when it was put in to the California Constitution when there was no registration, when ballots were not uniform and they could be obtained from party headquarters, and the ballot box itself was in 1850 simply a box that was formally some other sort of the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.936" offset="6972500">In San Francisco and Los Angeles, that was the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.180" offset="6981486">In Pelayho (ph) was reported that ballot box itself was an old cracker box which had a hole in the back of it, it was discovered years later through which ballots could be slipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.173" offset="7017430">And so, the framers in the California Constitution had good reason to be concerned about the integrity of the election process and I think that concern was reflected by this exclusion in the constitution, but the process in California today could not be more different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.177" offset="7073437">65% of our counties do vote by machine, but that is not the end of the matter and the other 35 counties, of course there’s registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.704" offset="7103530">They are uniform ballots with special water marks, but precincts are limited to a small number of voters per precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.630" offset="7127249">The precinct officials are residents of the precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.848" offset="7136131">They know the voters who are there and the California Supreme Court in reviewing the scheme concluded that the practice election, violation election fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.859" offset="7168209">Election problems in California today would require the coordinated skills of a vast squadron of computer technicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.860" offset="7196212">In other words, they found it was virtually impossible and the statistics in California is unmistakably set out in that opinion are that there has not been a reported case of vote buying or vote selling in California since 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.499" offset="7246785">The last reported violation in Los Angeles County which has a third approximately a third of California’s voters, the last complaint of any voter problem was in 1926 and the head of the Bureau of Criminals Statistics in California which has been in that position for 18 years stated that not one single election offense had been reported to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.810" offset="7324003">That’s why we were quite careful, Your Honor, to point out not only that there haven’t been any, although we would suggest there would be some first offender surely, but that given the way the system operates, it’s virtually impossible that there would be any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.148" offset="7373322">In other words, not only hasn’t there been in reality a danger, but the system is such that the danger is simply not present of fraud occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.443" offset="7406550">So, we want to take care of both of those parts of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.476" offset="7430687">This change in the election process was paralleled by change in California’s Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.838" offset="7448137">In 1850, when our constitution was adopted in California, there were only 8 misdemeanor offenses in the statutes dealing with election violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.313" offset="7485962">At that the time this case was decided, there were over a 150 such statutes on the books, including 76 felonies, covering such things as fraudulent registration, voting twice, bribery, intimidation and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.011" offset="7536744">So, that the California Supreme Court contrasting that situation with the situation which this Court in Dunn versus Blumstein found adequate to deter against elections fraud as reasonable means to deal with that problem, found that if anything, our situation was even more of a protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.449" offset="7602573">Further as is noted in the record, at the time that I am standing before you this keeps changing, but at the time I’m standing before you now, 26 of the states either never disfranchise at all or automatically restore the right to vote upon the completion of sentence and either a parole or probationary type period after the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.517" offset="7678851">The District of Columbia does the same, according to an act of Congress which I believe was passed in 1971, and of course, some California counties under Otsuka did not disqualify practically anybody, had not disqualified anybody and these states, the District of Columbia, these counties have not reported any difficulties with their election process, any parade of horribles or in fact, any problem at all in having re-enfranchised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.947" offset="7776549">Your Honor, before passing, I want to show you all parts for the case, I wanted to emphasize that there is perhaps present here, an unstated state interest if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.537" offset="7818867">An implication that perhaps if someone’s convicted of a crime that this evidence is anti-social behavior or an evidence of some inference of moral and fitness or something of the kind, and therefore, this person should not vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.757" offset="7867768">It’s mentioned I think, almost explicitly in some of the Lower Court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.684" offset="7883442">I'd want to point out number one that in this record, there is not evidence or whatever, a scintilla of evidence in fact that such an inference can properly be drawn as to any of these persons let alone as to all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.255" offset="7925760">In this country and I think the strength of the country is that we’ve never limited the franchise to persons not as to whom an inference is required, but to whom openly and a validly claim we should have an entirely different system of government or no system or whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.347" offset="7978109">These persons aren’t barred from the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.921" offset="7984483">These persons in fact are permitted to organize political parties and run candidates for office, let alone vote and this Court I think in reviewing the voting cases, well first in the Backstrom case, this Court refused to allow an influence to be drawn from a prior conviction such that a different process for commitment for mental illness would be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.699" offset="8059507">The Carrington and that Cipriano and the bond cases in Evans where a claim was maybe because persons living in the National Institute of Health because persons were in the military, they might vote in a certain manner, their might block voting and harmful voting, this Court said that we all think such inferences are proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.095" offset="8121156">Secondly the sheer over breath of drawing such broad inferences as to the entire class would not be permitted especially when we are talking about voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.591" offset="8155115">And finally again I would emphasize, Your Honor, that we are talking about persons who have completed the term in prison, whatever inferences might have been drawn during the period there, the state is rehabilitating, is dealing with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.015" offset="8192836">They have completed, successfully completed and have been released from their parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.233" offset="8205688">They reintegrated into the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.693" offset="8211540">They are active citizens and as to them continuing to draw this inference years later which we do not believe would be proper even in the first instance we think would not be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.829" offset="8248111">In fact to the contrary -- the real state interest is present in this case is the interest of rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.592" offset="8275069">The entire penal system is aimed at returning persons to a productive role in society and yet yet the time of their return, at the time when the state has passed this judgment as to release from parole, they’re screened out at the most important right or one of most important rights, the fundamental right to vote, fundamental because not only in itself because it leads to all other rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.031" offset="8388859">As I understand it when the right to vote or the right to participate in the election process on an equal basis is denied to citizens, the state is to come forward and demonstrate what interest it has that its furthering by screening these people out of the voting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.476" offset="8442671">Now they have suggested, perhaps integrity of the election process in terms fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.306" offset="8462002">The Attorney General as just stated that that problem doesn’t exist in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.987" offset="8472660">The California Court found so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.867" offset="8480183">I wanted before passing on to deal with this sort of implication that perhaps that there was some other state interest called moral unfitness or something of that description and to point out that this Court has not permitted those sort inference that -- and simply to dispel the notion and the comment that they’re -- perhaps you’re right, Your Honor, but there is this other state interest that is present, it’s the one of rehabilitation which the President's Commissions, the Vice President's Commissions and the ABA and the other organizations have urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.879" offset="8604212">Let me then take -- consider Section 2 because I think what we have in this case is a virtual concession that there is no state interest to deny the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.085" offset="8637127">But an argument that Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment nevertheless renders Section 1 inoperable and the words that are relied on in this case are the words participation and rebellion or other crime which are found in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.322" offset="8698044">Now, I’ve of course reviewed the legislative history and I’ve read the many articles that have been written about the legislative history of the I believe 39th Congress which adopted this and there is clearly in reading there are no one view as to no one purpose of all of the persons who were working on putting that amendment together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.667" offset="8767425">But we would suggest that a reading of the legislative history first would lead to the conclusion that participation or rebellion or other crime is really meant the deal with the problem of the rebellion and not the problem of former conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.358" offset="8858227">Yes, we will conclude that for two or three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.973" offset="8868676">First that -- in one looks of the purpose of Section 2, it was a penalty provision to deal with the increase in representation that would occur because the emancipation of the slight was not being counted as a full vote, instead of 3/5 of the vote, this was required under Article I, Section II and so the penalty provision was needed to deal with that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.012" offset="8948820">But boarder states as is indicated in the history, were concerned that they have just disfranchised large numbers of rebels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.099" offset="8977136">So that if the penalty provisions were simply put in the way it was originally phrased, they might lose representation in the House of Representatives on account of having disfranchised these persons who participated in the rebellion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.883" offset="9024261">Thus, this language relating to the rebellion came in and we suggest that was the purpose, looking at Section III again which deals with the right of former office holders who participated in the rebellion to once again become office holders, indicates once again that the rebellion was of the primary concern of the drafters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.471" offset="9114645">The phrase other crime itself is quite broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.241" offset="9125721">It would clearly within its scope and encompasses felonies, misdemeanors and other crimes which no state at time was disqualifying persons for, certainly infamous crime is certainly well known to framers might have been used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.548" offset="9438981">The emancipated -- well, it’s clear from reading of the history that they intended to put the southern states to a choice, either emancipate, either enfranchise the persons who have been emancipated or suffer a reduction in your congressional representation by not being allowed to count them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.338" offset="9506064">That this was the purpose and that in devising a formula to accomplish this penalty, they simply placed in the clause those restrictions; some of the restrictions that were generally in effect at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.082" offset="9557055">There is not any evidence in the debate that there was any discussion whatsoever or what would or would not be appropriate voter qualifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.037" offset="11968888">They would be -- I need not to my point out certainly disappointed if it came back to California Supreme Court for another reading and we feel that there was a denial of equal protection here to them under the California scheme, that there was a denial and at the state, there’s simply no state interest has been advanced that suggests that this disqualification in California today makes any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.733" offset="12051644">So, we would urge the affirmance of that decision.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2998.443" offset="12070557">Thank you gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.975" offset="12092604">I see, you have a few minutes left Mr. James.</text>

            <label>Mr. Duncan M. James</label>
            <text syncTime="3011.013" offset="12120816">One of the questions that was asked a few minutes ago was whether or not there was statute, a federal statute that went along with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.532" offset="12154880">What I’d like to bring to attention of the Court is 2 US Code Section 6 which is a restatement of the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2 which provides for the disenfranchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.017" offset="12232829">It says you can abridge -- you cannot abridge except for crime or rebellion and I do not have the legislative history to say when that Section was passed, but I would assume that at the time the US Code Section was passed that they were not under the pressures that Mr. Glick refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.491" offset="12314749">I'd also like to comment to the Court that in reviewing the history of the Constitution, it was interesting to read some of the comments that occurred during the arguments or hearings on the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.952" offset="12376607">During the course of the hearings on the Fifteenth Amendment, there were quite a number of proposed amendments which included exactly the same language that we are talking about here, except for crime or other rebellion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.394" offset="12438361">And I would submit that, as I believe it was Willard Warner, a representative from this State of Alabama indicated that it would seemed that the states should have the right under that small limited classification to accept from those persons the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.328" offset="12542015">We submit that the Equal Protection Clause is not applied because this constitutes an exception to the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.398" offset="12574302">Section 2 clearly says, except for rebellion or other crime when they’re talking about the reduction in the representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.623" offset="12615262">Now, the Equal Protection Clause seems to act as a protection to avoid what the last part of Section 2 says that if you deny the right to vote then we’re going to reduce your representation and what the Equal Protection Clause is saying, at least, I believe it says Is, "No, we don’t want to do that."</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.322" offset="12722051">The state is entitled to a full representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.946" offset="12732500">So if you disenfranchise a male inhabit 30 years old, we’re going to say that because of the Equal Protection Clause and because of the Twenty-sixth Amendment, this is a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.343" offset="12806165">So, I submit that although in California maybe as applied, there it is an unequal application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.809" offset="12852036">It is not a denial of the states of right to disenfranchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.398" offset="12870322">We have heard about all these people who go through the -- or who don’t want to vote or who are afraid to go register to vote because of the Otsuka decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.261" offset="12913789">But yet as respondents indicate, something in the neighborhood of 34,000 plus persons were released from state person from 1968 to 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.487" offset="12958720">There is a procedure under the California Penal Code to get a certificate of rehabilitation which gets back for you when you go through the administrative judicial process and up to government to get the right to vote back except for a person convicted twice separately.</text>
