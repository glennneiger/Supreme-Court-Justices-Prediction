            <text syncTime="49.551" offset="274913">This case is here on appeal from the judgment to the Supreme Court of Virginia, affirming three separate judgments of $55,000 each, a nice figure of $165,000 in all, against the Richmond Branch of the National Association of Letter Carriers and the Parent National Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.038" offset="384940">The three plaintiffs, beneficiaries to these judgments, are individual letter carriers who refused deliberately and willfully to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.558" offset="438962">Because of that refusal, they were identified as scabs in the local Branch’s monthly newsletter to its members and, in one issue, the Branch published pejorative definition of scab, popularly attributed to Jack London followed by a list of scabs which named the non-members, some-15 of them including the three plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.210" offset="573544">At least since 1897, according the Century Dictionary Encyclopedia which is quoted at page 51 of the Appendix, in labor parlance, a scab is workman who is not or refuses to become a member of a labor union.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.962" offset="1076558">Jack London was elaborated in literary fashion about what is conception of a scab was.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.734" offset="1207693">In any event, immediately after the article itself appeared, at page 77, appears a card from which the editor of the local paper derived the text of the article.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.864" offset="1324199">When, as Your Honors will see, the local Branch in response to a question by plaintiff Austin, saying he didn’t know what a scab was, published the London definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.687" offset="1555540">I do believe that the Century Dictionary Encyclopedia, which I quoted earlier, dated 1897 describes a scab as “an opprobrious term used by the workmen or others who dislike his action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="388.688" offset="1631504">Now, I assume that that means that to trade unionists those who refuse to join are low and contemptible people.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.787" offset="1679882">The record here reflects that both the President of the local union and the Vice President of the National stated their reasons for believing that so-called free riders who take the advantage of Union Representation without bearing their fair share of the cost or any share of the cost, who are willing to profit from the benefits and the efforts of their fellows to maintain wages and working conditions, who do as one of the plaintiffs here did, Ziegengeist, perform services off the clock on free time, gratis, for his employer are in fact low and contemptible people.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.499" offset="1858769">They choose to undermine the conditions for which workers organized and they fought and struggled.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.069" offset="1884996">That is their opinion of them, and it is our contention that both the National Relations laws and the First Amendment guarantee their right among themselves to express that opinion for the lawful purpose of exerting social pressure upon the non-members to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.849" offset="1988127">Now, we think that that proposition is supported by the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.274" offset="2013832">The questions principally presented are whether, as a matter of federal preemption, a state’s jurisdiction over defamation arising out of labor disputes is limited to knowing or reckless misrepresentation of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.833" offset="2128039">This publication in effect said, did it not, that these plaintiffs in that case, the respondents here, in effect were gentlemen compared with Judas who betrayed his master by linking these alleged London definition of a scab with these men?</text>

            <text syncTime="559.131" offset="2313300">I do not believe that the constitution or Linn, either one, distinguish the epithets which are particularly remarked in Linn as falling within the common place discussion, and one of the Labor Board cases which specifically says that this London definition itself is protected under Section 7 as falling without the area of protected speech in labor controversies, whereas, this Court said in Linn itself, “we do not judge by the normal standards of Gentleman Linn polite speech.”</text>
            <text syncTime="602.827" offset="2488007">In labor controversies, the Court has pointed out that the labor disputes are ordinarily heated affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="801.104" offset="3281189">I should like to refer to two other passages of Linn which have relevance, at least, here.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.675" offset="3319432">One is that the Labor Board has concluded that epithets such as “scab,” “unfair,” and “liar” are common place in these struggles.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.284" offset="3365930">I might add, as common place as the London definition, and not so indefensible as to remove them from the protection of Section 7, even though the statements are erroneous and defame one of the parties to the dispute, it's on pages 60-61, and I continue having skipped a sentence on page 61 to the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.257" offset="3473763">In sum, the Board tolerates intemperate, abusive, and inaccurate statements made by the union during attempts to organize employees, which was what this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.876" offset="3524232">It does not interpret the Act as giving either party license to injure the other intentionally by circulating defamatory or insulting material known to be false.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.666" offset="3663412">In order for a statement to be known to be false it must be factual, because if it is not factual, as Judge Marriage said in speaking for the Fifth Circuit in Curtis Publishing Co. against Birdsong which we cite in our brief, then it simply is not subject to the litmus paper test of truth or false until you talk, and if it’s not subject to the litmus paper test truth or false, then it can’t come within the scope of State Court jurisdiction under Linn.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.381" offset="3854315">But hyperbole, hyperbole certainly falls on the other side of the line, and that’s the point I really want to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.319" offset="3885976">That if rhetorical hyperbole, which is what the London statement is, is protected constitution and protected on the phrase that I read in Linn, then the protection must be coextensive with the artist’s imagination and certainly commensurate with the depth of the sentiment or the emotion in this case, particularly revolution against Workers who refuse to join their fellows in the union which the artist is seeking to express.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.563" offset="4018991">Actually, the images of the revoked -- that are revoked by the London literature are not too difficult to compare with the image invoked and whose favorable, who can say, “By those people who called Bresler a blackmailer,” which, in Bresler, this Court held enjoyed constitutional protection, and as the Chief Justice said speaking for this Court in Organization for Better Austin versus Keefe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.448" offset="4298501">I understand that the general framework of Austin was Near versus Minnesota and the prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.254" offset="4317727">But, what is said there about the First Amendment and about the reasons for knocking down the rationale of the Illinois Court which said that what it was doing was protecting the privacy of this businessman to conduct his business the way he chose to do legally, and as the laws of the State of Illinois gave him the right to conduct, and who chose and elected not to sign the contract that this organization placed before him and demanded that sign, and the Supreme Court held that that was an invasion of his privacy and it further held that the leafleting was not protected because it was a means of coercing him to change his business practices rather than as a means of communicating ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.209" offset="4509571">The striking down of those arguments was a matter of the philosophy of the First Amendment not Near versus Minnesota and prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.072" offset="4569025">Now, in one place, we distinguish this case most seriously from the case that preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.400" offset="4634331">Workmen drawn together in a common occupation by a common employer worked together whether they liked it or not, they’re in a common community, and a choice to bond together as a union and to become members of the same organization and participate in its affairs and to contribute to its upkeep and to abide by its rules and by its laws is a voluntary choice that each of them must make in the society in which we live.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.268" offset="4737776">I take the liberty from quoting from this Court’s decision in Time versus Hill, 385 US 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.792" offset="4767869">“Exposure of the self to others in varying degrees is a concomitant of life in a civilized community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.409" offset="4802351">The risk of this exposure is an essential incident of life in a society which places a primary value on freedom of speech and of press.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.281" offset="4853864">And so, every letter carrier exposes himself to the good or ill will of his fellows, those who are union members and those who are not, and when he makes the decision or when he makes the choice to join them in their union or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.321" offset="4914051">He by the same token, makes a choice of securing their social good will or their social ill will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.662" offset="4947383">Our opponents, indeed, concede that the union has a right to publish the fact of their scabness, that they are scabs, and by publishing it, they seek to induce other letter carriers to exert social pressure upon them to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.890" offset="5008300">They say “but they don’t have the right to do it by extravagant hyperbole.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.044" offset="5024914">We say, they do because the First Amendment protects extravagant hyperbole if it protects the right to speak about common interests at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.497" offset="5074756">Hyperbole, however, extravagant, is not obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.057" offset="5097012">What is relevant to this case is that the right to publish honestly held views or opinions in classic or artistic or hyperbolic form is protected where the publication particular goes to a special audience which has a special interest in the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.969" offset="5192620">As this union monthly newsletter went only to the members of the union who were intimately concerned with the union status of each of the non-members because it affected their pocketbooks immediately for one thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.930" offset="6496444">It must be kept in mind that all three of the appellees involved here have been employed in the Richmond Postal Service for 14, 13, and 12 years respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.495" offset="6546704">During this time, they elected not to become affiliated with the union, a right that they certainly had under Executive Order 11491 in the Virginia right to work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.057" offset="6596963">Now, on two occasions preceding the libelous publication in question, the name of Mr. Austin was printed on the local branch newsletter under the heading of the list of scabs at the time the actual so called Jack London definition was not in there, just the names under list of scabs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.500" offset="6898730">But, rather, what we are concerned with is the fact that these three gentlemen were held up to ridicule with their fellow employees by attributing to each one of them lack of character, rotten principles, and being traitors to God, country, family, and class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.105" offset="6973127">A union would contend that certainly this was mere hyperbole that no one would take the same seriously, but the fact remains that at the trial, Secretary Angelo Parker of the union testified that he felt the appellees’ principle should be questioned, in fact, he felt they had rotten principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.424" offset="7054420">The President of the local union testified that this was done for one reason and one reason alone, so that fellow employees would stop associating with these three persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.114" offset="7101231">I think an interesting point in clarifying the situation that we are dealing with here today is being one of first instance, was brought forth by Mr. Kenneth Fiester, President of the International Labor Press Association where, on the witness stand, he testified that he has been involved in the labor movement for some 30 years and that during these 30 years he had seen this article printed numerous times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.668" offset="7191406">In fact, so many numerous times that he couldn’t even begin to try to count how many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.577" offset="7211050">Yet, under cross-examination, he admitted that in the entire 30 some year period he had never actually seen this article appear listing certain person’s names, named as individuals as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.977" offset="7272699">All three of the appellees stated that they had all experienced for a very, very long time a good relationship with fellow workers and up until the time this article appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.554" offset="7342916">What we have here, I feel the main problem involved here is whether what was done was printing this publication of concerning the appellees whether this falls within the Doctrine of New York Times or Sullivan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.544" offset="9066893">In other words, by couching expressions in terms and hyperbolic fashion, you can escape the conscription of libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.175" offset="9101479">This is what they’re saying and I say, of course, this is not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.778" offset="9127811">In using this article, of course, in the way -- for the purpose that the union used it, it proves the qualified privilege that was given to them, the privilege that lets the union members know that -- who are not union members and, therefore, they are -- the union is liable to the appellees for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.165" offset="9201371">Aside from being an effort, of course, of the union to compel appellees to join the union, no labor dispute was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.365" offset="9234181">Everybody in the Richmond Post Office except the handful of carriers at the Richmond Post Office were already members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.885" offset="9264274">There’s no violence here in any place shown, no picketing, no publicity, in what way possibly could the public have any interest in whether or not these three individuals used their right to join the union or not, exercise that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.152" offset="9329371">I feel that this case can be, again, can be distinguished from the Rosenbloom case and as much as in that case, of course, it was a circulation intended to reach the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.874" offset="9384229">Here, we’re just attempting to reach a specific group, namely the union members and, in that case, of course we had criminal conduct involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.277" offset="9417874">We had obscenity involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.792" offset="9423935">Certainly, these are factors that the general public would be interested in, no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.176" offset="9445460">But, I say in this case, absolutely no way that I -- possibly a person could say, stretching Rosenbloom way out of proportion, that these persons came under the realm of Rosenbloom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.895" offset="9548278">Of course, all the appellants, Mr. Jack London's article, it was introduced into evidence, and no where does this Jack London article name appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.137" offset="9589342">I mean, the article is printed but no where underneath it is anyone’s name listed and, as I said earlier, this was brought out at the trial that never in a 37-year following the labor movement in this country had this person ever since this before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.098" offset="9657156">The main reason we propose at this time that this article was written for one reason alone, to exert pressure on these individuals to join the union and to exert so that fellow workers would austersize them and no longer associate with these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.650" offset="9755376">We get into the question of whether freedom of speech in the press permits a publication of this type of a libelous article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.706" offset="9787559">In the case of Chaplinsky versus New Hampshire, this Court stated “That it is well understood that the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.369" offset="9838237">There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.096" offset="9857149">The prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.078" offset="9901035">Now, of course, no violence was present in this case, very true but Mr. Austin, one of the appellants, stated that on one occasion he was confronted by the union steward and he was able to restrain himself from committing an assault upon this person and that the article on many occasions provoked him to the point where he considered committing assault on purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.408" offset="10018377">Gentlemen, I thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.362" offset="10054217">Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.307" offset="10101969">This Court in the Linn case afforded workers a measure of protection against malicious libel for causing them harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.351" offset="10142198">When the workers were given that measure for protection, the New York Times rule had already been promulgated and was held not constitutionally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.995" offset="10188696">Today, we are viewing the measure of protection afforded to non-union workers in the light of the progeny of New York Times as Curtis Publishing Co. and Rosenbloom versus Metromedia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.043" offset="10244911">The majority opinion in Rosenbloom left open to future determination the extent of a private person’s involvement in matters of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.747" offset="10299768">Mr. Justice Marshall, in his dissent in Rosenbloom with which Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Harlan concurred, pointed out that two essential and fundamental values conflict, that is the right of an obscure and anonymous person for protection from unjustified insult and wrongful hurt which he states reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and work of every human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.068" offset="10453055">On the other hand, the concept of a citizen informed by a free and unfettered press with this conflict, a fundamental right, it is necessary for the Court to determine which of the fundamental rights is a more compelling and paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.013" offset="10540826">This conflict must be viewed and result in the light of the particular circumstances under which the conflict arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.843" offset="10580114">In considering the rights of a private and anonymous citizen giving way by reason of his being involved in a matter of general public interest, the right of a public to be informed by free and unfettered press, I make the point that there is a basic difference between a labor union and public media.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.038" offset="10680947">And particularly so in the relationship between a labor union and a non-union worker in a plant or organization in which a union is bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.403" offset="10734341">Union, first, is not concerned with informing the public of the general public, but is concerned with promoting its own particular interests, which interests are in direct conflict with the interest of a non-union worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.183" offset="10805499">The union newsletter which has just been mentioned was circulated only to union members and not to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.552" offset="10850952">On the hand, the media’s only interest is in informing the public on a matter which is of general or public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.749" offset="10903719">It is without bias in the matter and this was not true in the case of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.222" offset="10929633">When we consider that this background, the right of the individual of non-union worker under the circumstances here of merely failing or refusing to join union as against the right of the general public to know even if this could be considered a matter of general public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.602" offset="11019180">The compelling and paramount interest, we assert, is clearly that of the non-union worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.149" offset="11057319">If union had this right, it would have within its power, by publishing in its newsletter, to make anything a matter of public interest, then that has the bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.916" offset="11124402">The organization that has the bias would have the right of making it a matter of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.846" offset="11156167">This matter that we’re talking about here had never been in the press, it had never been discussed anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.461" offset="11174557">It was strictly between union and these particular non-union workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.721" offset="11199634">Under the protection of the New York Times rule, a standard most difficult and almost impossible of proof by the aggrieved person, union would be able to harass and coerce non-union workers, the rights of non-union workers not to join union under various State Right To Work Laws and in the instant case, under the executive order as well, would be largely nullified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.707" offset="11311543">Now, the Executive Order does say specifically that the union cannot, has no right to coerce non-union members into joining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.635" offset="11355324">So that when Mr. Austin went to the Postmaster General and went to the President of that union to complain, he was well within his rights to say they are attempting to coerce me and they themselves, as I took it from what Mr. Ratner said here today, for practical purposes mentioned, they were attempting to coerce him, at least the tactics, as I construe them, would mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.805" offset="11451977">In the case before us, the President of the union admitted that this publication was one of the tools used by union to compel non-union members to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.205" offset="11509551">Unions are, today, wealthy, monolithic organizations with almost unlimited resources as opposed to a few non-union workers in a particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.798" offset="11563990">Armed with virtual immunity under New York Times rule, the union would have within its power the means, if it so chose and as it did here --</text>
