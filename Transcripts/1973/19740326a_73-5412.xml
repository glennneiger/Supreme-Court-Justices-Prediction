            <text syncTime="17.267" offset="145868">The issue in this case is whether the procedures in Virginia for the suspending of Workmen’s Compensation benefits meet the requirements of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.987" offset="200725">The procedures which are in effect now in Virginia under Rule 13 of the Rules in Industrial Commission require that an employer or a Workmen’s Compensation carrier submit to the Commission a verified application for a hearing and whatever evidence it has as to the workers’ disability or lack of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.033" offset="304901">The Commission will then make an ex parte determination that probable cause exists to believe that the worker is no longer eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.714" offset="355579">The lower Three-Judge Federal Court with one judge dissenting held that since there was a post suspension hearing which all parties agreed does provide due process, is a judicial-type hearing, that since there was this hearing after the suspension that was all the due process required.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.505" offset="454740">Appellants’ position is that opportunity -- notice which is adequate and timely must be given to the worker and that he has an opportunity to present his side of the dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.266" offset="4109793">As was brought out earlier, the questions in Workmen’s Compensation cases can be very complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.069" offset="4145006">For example, whether an employer, an employee has unjustifiably refused medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.269" offset="4181786">What the decider of fact that Workmen’s Compens -- the Industrial Commission of Virginia has before it in this probable cause procedure is merely one side's, the employer or carrier side of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.419" offset="4246465">There is nothing before it under this procedure as to the workers' justification for refusing a further medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.715" offset="4287634">I think what this Court said in Bell v. Burson is opposite in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.555" offset="4310936">It is a preposition which hardly seems to need explication that a hearing which excludes consideration of an element essential to a decision does not give due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.398" offset="4350328">In Bell v. Burson it was fault in taking away the driver’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.126" offset="4369241">Here, Virginia’s procedure excludes in this instance whether the worker is justified or unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.693" offset="4407484">An example cited at Page 8 of appellants apply to the amici for the Industry, the case of Thompson v. United Piece &amp; Dye Works, the carrier had said the injured worker was unjustifiably refusing a back operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.154" offset="4489404">When it got to the Commission and the worker was able to submit his side, it was shown that this worker had undergone three prior back operations with no improvement and the Commission I think obviously found, of course, he was justified in refusing to go through another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.713" offset="4571638">Also, there are questions which are able to be determined very summarily such as the example I gave of whether the worker is no longer can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.486" offset="4630674">What we are asking this Court to do as it is done in most of the procedural due process cases, is to set the broad perimeters of what due process requires notice and the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.832" offset="4692114">As I think the Court said in Fuentes, it is peculiarly the state's function to set the procedures exactly, balance the interest as to how much -- how close to a judicial type proceeding it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.521" offset="4774870">And this Court though I feel should give the broad outlines, the basic fundamental and basic fairness as the Court reasonably said in Groppi which procedural due process has always required.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.835" offset="5308082">I will address myself to the question basically of the due process aspect of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.385" offset="5394286">At the outset, I would refer the Court to the yellow brief of the amici of American Insurance Association and the American Mutual Insurance Alliance, Page 15 where there is factual error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.540" offset="5458860">This is in the guidelines where they set out five guidelines, and the statement is found on line four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.338" offset="5494073">“The doctor’s medical report must indicate that the employee can return to work within seven days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.655" offset="5519360">Speculation as to the employee’s condition further in the future will not support a probable cause finding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.579" offset="5543079">Apparently, there is simply a lack of communication between the amici in this case and the Industrial Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.636" offset="5563246">The Industrial Commission takes the position that this is in fact not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.473" offset="5586651">There is no ability for prospective determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.180" offset="5601489">No doctor can say, I believe that this employee will be able to go back to work in three or four days or seven or fifteen days and obtain a probable cause finding on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.153" offset="5641404">There is absolutely no prospective result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.622" offset="5911197">I believe the important note -- what we think is important about this case in that is fairly unique and it's unique for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.541" offset="5942962">First of all, there is the probable cause determination under Rule 13. The second thing is with respect to the what amounts to a tripartite rights and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.444" offset="5998550">We have the interest of course of the employee, the interest of the employer and we have the interest of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.105" offset="6029166">I think to understand the way that this system actually works, one needs to look at what exactly Workmen’s Compensation is and if I may spend just a few moments outlining the way the system works in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.187" offset="6077544">Of course Workmen’s Compensation is basically a substitute for common law tort and under this procedure, the basic changes regarding the fact the employee no longer has a certain tort and therefore would not get as much money perhaps in particular cases on the Workmen’s Compensation he would get under common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.550" offset="6158942">On the other hand, the employer gives up certain defenses such as the doctrine of fellow servant, of contributory negligence, and so forth and therefore there is at least compensation on every case in industrial accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.069" offset="6233025">The system provides basically for two types of payment: One a medical; the second is temporary compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.585" offset="6263118">Now, they may in fact be permanent incapacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.983" offset="6276702">The provision on the law, there will be a rating of a percentage of capacity and there will be payments on the basis of that, but up until a doctor is able to rate an employee, there will be temporary compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.937" offset="6332500">The statute provides for payment during incapacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.214" offset="6349636">The award in the case of Mr. Williams and Mr. Dillard provides for payment during incapacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.307" offset="6377953">So then as to be anticipated that this payment will not go on forever and that in fact there are generally three ways in which it will end, one is of course that the employee recovers and is able to go back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.888" offset="6436258">Secondly, it is clear that he has progressed to whatever point he is going to with respect to his incapacity and is rated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.204" offset="6465515">Or third, he may have been partially incapacitated for the entire statutory period of 500 weeks and essentially his famous will run out under that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.693" offset="6523507">Now, with respect to a question that Justice Blackmun raised, this gets me really to my next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.106" offset="6549211">This is what we think is the touchstone of the system of Virginia and what makes it work as well as it does and that is voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.434" offset="6582439">As counsel for the appellants have already suggested roughly 95% of the cases are decided without any opinion or handled by the employer, the employee and the insurance companies act in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.027" offset="6640849">Now, Mr. Levy has suggested in his reply brief and also he suggested in response to Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question that he would not impute any bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.703" offset="6683585">We submit that’s not the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.136" offset="6693303">The problem is that at the present time it is in the insurance company’s self-interest and in the employers’ self-interest to very properly undertake payment to an employee and in Workmen’s Comp situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.197" offset="6749518">This is done because it is a moral factor for the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.497" offset="6766759">The employer likes to get the employee getting favor soon and in fact the Commission knows that often payment is made to the employee prior to there even being an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.905" offset="6808346">Now, this is also based on the fact that if the employer finds out that there’s been some sort of mistake, the representation of the employer turns out to be something different from what has been represented, it is readily easy to terminate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.627" offset="6871249">Of course under the present system where there has been change of condition, he can terminate it and set it for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.231" offset="6901656">We submit that the problem will be not simply as you have in Goldberg, you will have a hearing every time somebody wants one, that’s not all you’ll have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.212" offset="6937600">You'll have all of the extra hearings from the people who want them and then on top of that you will have all the hearings with a cause on the front end, not because of any bad faith, but simply because it has become in the insurance companies and employers' economic self interest to look much harder at the claim before they ever take it to be sure that this is a compensable claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.487" offset="7150655">So that an individual company's experience will not affect its insurance premium, but the industry experience will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.447" offset="7182524">Now, to that extent, I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you raise a good point to separate the insurance company from the self-employer or self-insured employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.177" offset="7221499">The self insured employer of course across the street from each to competitors, one having a claim and they although not may be in a competitive situation such that he can’t absorb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.712" offset="7267579">It maybe a small business, just simply cannot absorb it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.126" offset="7281267">This, of course, wouldn’t happen were they were insurance companies because the competitive angle is then gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.377" offset="7306240">That is every other bricklayer has got to pay the same premium if they are inflated as this bricklayer does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.150" offset="7333303">Well that I should think of that situation, particularly a small employer might not have an identical interest with the insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.418" offset="7358380">He might have an interest in obtaining compensation for an employee perhaps even when the literal provisions of the law weren't complied with if it is not going to affect his premium.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.669" offset="7403416">He would not, but his carrier of course would have a legitimate interest in it and the employer has the interest to the extent that he would not want his premium to go up which it necessarily would as a result of this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.284" offset="7469871">It would be quite easy for any employee of simply to say no when asked of his change of condition had occurred and ask for the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.812" offset="7511980">I might further respond as far as the time limit is concerned, I don’t think in fact that the interrogatories reflect with the time limit is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.831" offset="7556075">I think it is interrogatory number 14 is the answer to the question about what is the time limit for change of condition hearings and that is what is the delay between their request for the hearing at the time of the hearing and the answer of this is to refer it back to answer six and answer six refers the interrogatory to the fact that these records are simply not available in that form and they could come to the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.777" offset="7655863">So what we end up with is simply no statistics in the record to show what the delay is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.181" offset="7677492">The Commission was unable to obtain them without going through all of its files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.167" offset="7693375">There are some other statistics with respect to the one month and the one to three months and I might say based on my own knowledge having been advised by my client that these are probably in the ballpark for these types of hearings as well, but they are not, there has been no statistics in the record as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.832" offset="7788042">The important thing, we think from the point of view of the voluntariness with respect to the increased litigation which the commission expects to occur is the fact that this is not in the employee’s best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.889" offset="7848333">The Commission in a sense is biased towards the employee, that is really has raised on deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.974" offset="7868604">That’s what is there for the rules and the statute make it very clear it’s very liberal for the employee, heresy evidence can be presented by the employee, all sorts of loosening of normal judicial constraints of their -- and the commission believes it will not be in employee’s best interest in the sense that the employee for example often will have returned to work by the time he will have ever got his hearing if the insurance company denies that they have a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.228" offset="7989708">Often, these actions don’t incapacitate the employee for more than several weeks or several months and he is likely to be back at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.775" offset="8023876">If he of course has been living on his income and he has no savings he is not going to be able to get to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.408" offset="8046341">The very argument which the appellants made for having the benefits continue comes back on the front end to show that it’s a very good reason for not having it work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.519" offset="8102870">Now, as far as the -- again, the employer or insurance company’s ability to abuse this process, one can’t lose sight of the fact that there is a probable cause to termination by a disinterested, perhaps even biased towards the employee party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.583" offset="8195030">And another important thing to note is with respect to this case is that all of the actions which took place with respect to these two appellants took place prior to amended Rule 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.841" offset="8232124">That is under old Rule 13, there was no probable cause in finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.573" offset="8247066">The Commission simply in a ministerial fashion received applications for hearings and set them without making any finding with respect to the probable cause of the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.300" offset="8293982">For example in the case of Mr. Dillard, the letter fairly read from the doctor Sibling indicates that Mr. Dillard was predicted to be able to go back to work in a couple of weeks under present procedures there would have been no probable cause finding in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.234" offset="8377678">And Mr. Levy for the appellant suggests in his brief that there is no reason to think that the employee will not go back to work when he is able because it’s not in his economic self-interest to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.219" offset="8441626">I think the statistics show that this is apparently probably not a reasonable conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.132" offset="8461270">First of all, his has 66 and two-thirds percent is very close to -- being tax-free is very close to situation for a person who is not earning more than the maximum anyway of wage taken home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.165" offset="8521456">Further, the statistics would show that indeed a great number of these employees do ask for hearings and our footnote 8 in our brief, we setup for the court of what was a representative sample of a six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.981" offset="8580702">Not all of the hearings in the six-month period, but a representative sample in which over 91% of the claims in which probable cause had been found were affirmed by the Court, excuse me, by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.391" offset="8646322">Now, this would suggest that there are great number of employees who although able to return to work at least as found by the Commission are willing to ask for these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.139" offset="8685296">I would like to very briefly highlight a couple of very important protections for the employer under this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.492" offset="8718733">First of all is the problem of cause determination as I have already mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.684" offset="8739527">Secondly, as we’ve said in our brief there is a fact that the employee himself is able to choose the doctor from a panel pre selected by the employer and in fact the Commission is very liberal in permitting the employee to have another doctor, if he wishes one as was done both in the case of Mr. Dillard and Mr. Williams.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.559" offset="8938998">As a matter of fact and this was one of the points I was going to get to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.657" offset="8951327">They cannot even enforce their own decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.564" offset="8970971">Section 65.1-100, the Virginia Code provides enforcement of these decrees in the court of record so that the Commission cannot require an employer to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.526" offset="9014857">The only ability it has in this respect is that under Rule 13, it could refuse to grant a hearing to an employer who had not complied with the constraint of that rule, that is they had not paid up to the time this probable cause of determination is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.837" offset="9068147">But it does not control the fund, it cannot order that employer to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.727" offset="9083611">It can only -- if he refuses to pay an initial award for example they could assess attorney’s fees when it got to hearing, but it cannot essentially make the judgment good for the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.392" offset="9134289">It has no ability to do this and this is the important factor that these funds or private funds, they are controlled by the Commission and every dollar was taken from the employer or its insurance company, and given to the employee is a dollar that he doesn’t have anymore for the private purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.940" offset="9200536">I would like to mention one more point with respect to the protection for employee and that’s this question of notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.338" offset="10214087">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.017" offset="10228820">I think the argument before this Court already indicates the reason that we ask the Court to grant us the right to argue to split the appellee’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.859" offset="10276153">You heard about the interest of the employee and you’ve heard about the interest to the state, but our position here is the interest that has been forgotten is the interest of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.797" offset="10323905">This Court has long held that the Fourteenth Amendment as a shield which protects the liberties and properties of our citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.737" offset="10355670">What the appellant’s today ask is that the shield be converted into a sword and this sword, they use to deprive the employers of their property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.002" offset="10404780">Appellants ask this Court to weigh the private competing interest of the employer on one hand and the employee on the other and upon finding that the employees need is greater to order that the employer yield up his funds to an employee for whom you had an independent finding or probable cause that the employee is not entitled to these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.231" offset="10509688">And after the employer has established his defense the -- plus the fact that under Virginia law all the funds that are paid to an employee, whether under mistake or whatever by an employer under the Workmen’s Compensation system can never be recouped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.779" offset="10571860">There is no right of employer to recoup any funds, but yet if the employee’s suspension is later found to be erroneous then the employee is immediately paid up to date.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2636.509" offset="10622746">Of course, as I read appellants’ brief they agree that Virginia could change the law if this thing were reversed and permit recoup?</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.224" offset="10657646">They could permit recoup, but I think probably the answer and this gets again to the state's arguments that delicate balance here that state has struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.124" offset="10693277">And they have weighed it against the employers because I think they have found it was not -- the state found it was not in the state’s interest to have the employer pursuing persons who just come off of Workmen’s Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.093" offset="10745104">This is I think an indication of the state's concern for the well-being of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.018" offset="10772793">It’s something we employers have to live with, but today it hasn’t become access, if it does we may be in this Court on the other side of the case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2684.071" offset="10813022">Has there ever been any attack on that Virginia statute on the grounds that it’s a denial of due process, the irrebuttable presumption in effect about the recoupment?</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.370" offset="10858266">Not -- no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.424" offset="10862446">Not that the annotation show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.060" offset="10872999">It's not a presumption, it just says well and it may be helpful to explain this because I don’t think that the Court -- it hadn’t been explained the Court exactly how this system operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.828" offset="10908108">In Virginia, if there’s an accident, it appears to be a compensable accident and the disability has to run more than seven days or there has to be medical expenditures, the employer and employee in 95% of the cases enter into a stipulation and it is entered -- then entered by the Commission as an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.357" offset="10978220">The order speaks that the employer shall pay specified benefits during incapacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.329" offset="11010090">By statue, this order continues until it is amended or altered by the Commission after a full due process hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.319" offset="11042064">Any amounts paid there under are not recouped by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.213" offset="11057633">What the Rule 13 that that you’ve heard about is a procedural addition or enhancement of employee’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.362" offset="11086158">As it was stated earlier, these Commission awards are not enforceable by the Commission and must be enforced in the court of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.285" offset="11113848">So, if the employer or the insurance carrier didn’t pay it have to go in the court and sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.957" offset="11140598">The Industrial Commission, in the 30’s created Rule 13 which says in effect the only way that employer can check and alter this award is to come to us for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.544" offset="11194932">But we’re not going to receive an application for a hearing until you pay that employee up until the date of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.924" offset="11228473">And the subsequent amendments have said we are not going to give you a hearing until you have given us evidence which shows probable cause to believe that there’s been a change in condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.235" offset="11273718">What they have done -- what the Commission has done is to limit the employer’s right to this due process hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.040" offset="11304960">And a by-product of this has been to give the employee some additional claims to funds without having to go to a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.500" offset="11338710">And what they are claiming is their property right is this future extension which they have never had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.924" offset="11360444">And the Roth case, I think recognizes that it’s a sort of a unilateral wish, but it’s nothing that’s found in the state statute that you can really complain as property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.266" offset="11405793">A couple of corrections on the error on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.151" offset="11421362">Coverage does not extend to all employers and all employees in state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.397" offset="11434318">That statute applied is mandatory for employers of three or more employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.056" offset="11456993">Employers of smaller in numbers can come under the Act but they do so voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.391" offset="11478309">Coverage, thus, is not mandatory and further more, the contract does issue to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.063" offset="11504953">It doesn’t get a written copy, but the Virginia Code Section 65.1-111 says in effect that the employee shall be allowed to bring an action his own name against the insurance company on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.344" offset="11566080">The real question here I think is the property that the employer is going to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.229" offset="11597636">You’ve got a system where the employer, his natural interest is to suspend payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.737" offset="11623654">Now, the fact that he suspends payment after this initial hearing doesn’t mean that the employee cannot go into the Court and enforce it because he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.861" offset="11652180">He can always go into court and enforce it even after Commission has found probable cause to believe that there is a changing condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2903.085" offset="11689064">That doesn't meet the time problem that was involved for example in Goldberg, does it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.556" offset="11714978">Well, Your Honor if you read Goldberg together with Roth, I think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.894" offset="11732323">The right that they have got -- the enforceable right is in this award and this award must be enforced in the court of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.295" offset="11761894">And even after the employer has gotten a hearing until that order issues out of the Commission at some later date, that award continues to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.834" offset="11796062">And he gets -- it can be sued on and get judgment, almost a confession of judgment even up until the day the Commission rescinds that order or amends that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.264" offset="11837753">So, he still has the enforceable right in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.861" offset="11848202">What he is asking for is some sort of decision by the Commission to call up the employer and say, “Well, we got a favorable decision for this man is not entitled the money but we are not going to release this decision until you pay him up to date.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.767" offset="11911837">And that's the time situation -- you get to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.164" offset="11921450">There are two competing claims of the contract in nature between the employer and the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.515" offset="11942766">Every dollar the employer pays comes out of his pocket or his insurance company’s pocket and they’ll get it back from it, but what -- the money he pays that’s unjustified he can never recover from the claimant.</text>
