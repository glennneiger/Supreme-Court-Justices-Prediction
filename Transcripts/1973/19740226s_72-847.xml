            <text syncTime="13.594" offset="131135">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of an Arizona statute which required a yearâ€™s residence in a county as a condition to an indigent is receiving nonemergency hospitalization or medical care at county expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.213" offset="209607">In an opinion filed today, we reverse that judgment holding that the challenge durational residence requirement violates Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.139" offset="245342">The residence requirement creates an invidious classification and that penalizes the right of interstate migration, and denying medical care, a basic necessity of life to indigent newcomers.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.263" offset="293825">A classification which does impinges on a constitutional protected interest can only be sustained on the showing of a compelling state interest, a burden here, the State has filed to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.786" offset="339905">Its asserted purpose of deterring the immigration of indigents is a constitutionally impermissible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.712" offset="367595">The other purposes stated by the State for the residence requirement do not satisfy its having the burden of justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.630" offset="395285">Accordingly, the judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.957" offset="412526">The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun concur in the result Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a concurring opinion; Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
