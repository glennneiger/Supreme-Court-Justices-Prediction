            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will here arguments first, this morning on number 73-679, Wolff against McDonnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.865" offset="140225">Mr. Kammerlohr you may precede whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melvin Kent Kammerlohr</label>
            <text syncTime="20.644" offset="159347">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.043" offset="180872">I had the honor of appearing here several years ago on the issue, first impression of whether or not the states should be required to have a Post Conviction Remedies and the case of Case versus Nebraska, you will recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.599" offset="251193">When I just before the time for argument, our State Legislature passed Post Conviction Remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.471" offset="278674">So, I came back armed with the certified copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.751" offset="295706">Unfortunately I don’t have anything like that with me today, but this Court praised the action of Nebraska at any rate, in the interest of rates, federal relations and in the interest of comity for passing a Post Conviction Remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.123" offset="361221">Unfortunately our problems haven’t been as strong in this area as they have been in the area of Civil Rights Action as this Court knows and as the increase in Federal Courts is growing throughout the nation in Civil Rights actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.780" offset="447843">But, in the same spirit, I would like to urge this Court and I do urge this Court that as honorable Chief Justice Burger in his dissent to Goldberg v. Kelly in a companion case, urged at that time that as these administrative regulations are involving that we should not make them of constitutional quality and take away the flexibility, but to give them a chance to evolve and that's what we are urging here as briefs on both sides show.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.015" offset="588800">We are I think in pretty much agreement of what we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.380" offset="606250">People aren’t really saying that prisoners shouldn’t have this or shouldn’t have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.914" offset="640418">But, it is more of a question of whether it should be a constitutional quality or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.494" offset="658704">And the groups of various prison administrators are constantly working and making model regulations and so on as the briefs also show.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.812" offset="715964">So, on that part we would strongly urge that this not be raised, the question of constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.371" offset="782211">Mr. Justice Stewart also emphasizes in a recent case of Preiser v. Rodriquez, when he was pointing the need for exhausting state remedies in cases of habeas corpus type and he specifically stated that in regard to prisons, he said, since these internal problems of state prison involve the issues so peculiarly within state authority and expertise, the states have an important interest in not being by-passed in the correction of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.316" offset="918047">I think the same with equal with authority be stated in this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.719" offset="951589">Of course the question also gets down to whether the inmate has actually lost liberty in instances where say, he is taken from the general population and placed in Adjustment Center or solitary confinement, has he lost liberty within the meaning of the Constitution or was this contemplated at the time of his Due Process trail, his Due Process sentence and partially his Due Process revocation proceeding or probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.714" offset="1095576">Was this liberty then taken from him?</text>
            <text syncTime="257.935" offset="1108532">What does the Judge mean when he says, I sentence you to a penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.345" offset="1126087">After all this Due Process had been given, what does the Judge actually mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="266.088" offset="1141133">I think a lot of Judges probably themselves don’t know the situation of the tears of the cells and how much time the inmates in one institution work and how much in another they work or how much they are involved in this or that.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.165" offset="1197453">So, what does a judge mean when he says, I sentence you to the penitentiary?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.614" offset="1231203">I would next move to another very important issue in this case Your Honors and this involves the interpretation of Johnson versus Avery in which this Court said that if one inmate would not be permitted to assist another in preparation of legal petitions in habeas corpus proceedings then the prison must provide some alternative and the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit in the present case went on to say that we must also consider in whether this alternative, it sounds like we must also consider Civil Rights Act and we say this is an extension, a great extension of Johnson versus Avery because Johnson versus Avery in several places specifically limited the case to habeas corpus proceedings providing us alternative and if it is extended to Civil Rights Proceedings, it is going to mean a terrific increase in the number of cases and as this court knows from reading the multitude of cases throughout the United States and the Federal District Courts and the US Court Of Appeals, these inmates will sue on every conceivable possible thing, nearly every step the administration takes or it does not take.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="371.321" offset="1562018">What do you understand the Eight Circuit to have said Mr. Kammerlohr with respect to what the world would have to in connection with?</text>

            <label>Mr. Melvin Kent Kammerlohr</label>
            <text syncTime="379.895" offset="1596291">I understand them to mean Your Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that in considering the federal -- remanded the federal district court where the district judge determines whether or not Nebraska was providing a reasonable alternative to permitting one inmate to help another but they must take in to consideration Civil Rights Actions as well as habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.781" offset="1707886">I think they meant that are we furnishing inmate assistance for the Civil Rights Act, and are we are doing it sufficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.487" offset="1746651">I think this is giving a new completely, new constitutional right and that was indeed meant over even contemplated by Johnson versus Avery.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="428.686" stopTime="448.806">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="428.686" offset="1791478">Mr. Kammerlohr, I am talking about one little thing, do we have final judgment here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvin_kent_kammerlohr" startTime="448.806" stopTime="512.256">
            <label>Mr. Melvin Kent Kammerlohr</label>
            <text syncTime="448.806" offset="1871935">I believe we do Mr. Justice Blackmun in the sense that I see what you are getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.677" offset="1907461">The court did say that the district court should on remand determine some of these issues, such as whether -- in what situation, right to counsel for example is required at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.392" offset="1966289">However, we are also arguing in another point that this cert was granted in this case as who should make the initial determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="481.391" offset="2002338">Should it be the district court or should it be the prison administration, and then review those characterial things.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.763" offset="2027833">In other words, shouldn't the Court set the guidelines as it did and if it is going to set guide lines as it did in Morrissey versus Brewer, as to future cases and then the prison administration within those guidelines would have to set the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.198" offset="2089587">So, I suppose you can argue all around, whether how federal it is, because of the nature of the way these things arise.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="512.256" offset="2125740">Do you view court of appeals as having made a constitutional decision in general outline?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvin_kent_kammerlohr" startTime="519.861" stopTime="650.025">
            <label>Mr. Melvin Kent Kammerlohr</label>
            <text syncTime="519.861" offset="2156147">Yes Your Honor I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.943" offset="2164506">I believe that especially, I may question of Right to Counsel, they did say that there must be some cases where there is right to counsels and which is a new extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.269" offset="2209855">It also presumed that there are constitutional rights to some due process at this primary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.562" offset="2242978">The court said that we had admitted this, we had admitted this as far as revocation of good time because Morrissey versus Brewer came back in the mean time, reversing Eight Circuit and Morrissey versus -- we did then concede that as far as good-time was concerned that there was due process due in Nebraska because our good-time is directly related eligibility for parole, but we did not concede that there was any due process due in any other disciplinary proceedings which our brief in the Eight Circuit clearly points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.065" offset="2389055">I am sorry, anyway I am also arguing that we could not concede constitutional rights one way or the another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.240" offset="2409744">That is up to this court and not of us to be conceding, what are the constitutional rights or what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.370" offset="2438269">Briefly, I would like to hit one more issue and then I will be through Your Honors and that is the question of opening attorney inmate mail for contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.755" offset="2495739">We feel that the Eight Circuit rules are that the shut down on this case would be difficult to administer or they say a simple telephone call to the attorneys whose name appears on the letter would determine whether the attorney had actually sent the letter or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.338" offset="2574106">First, it's not a matter of simple telephone call especially in the federal premises where they might have called United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.812" offset="2603990">A lot of attorneys are hard to get whole lot on the first call and we think, it would be much simpler if there is some quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.541" offset="2634919">They also state that in appropriate circumstances, the mail could be opened in the presence of the inmate, but we don't know what appropriate circumstances are.</text>

            <text syncTime="781.539" offset="3202926">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.974" offset="3212643">United States is quite concerned about the decision of the Eighth Circuit and that the possibility that constitutional rules formulated in this case, might impair the freedom of the Bureau of Prisons to continue its evolution of prison disciplinary procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.991" offset="3264679">We have described that evolution today in the Appendix to our brief and I won't pause discuss it here, but the government does believe that its current procedures in disciplinary actions and federal prisons accord that process which is due in the unique setting of prison life.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.063" offset="3333016">It is a process whose objective must be remembered as correction and rehabilitation and not punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.203" offset="3357571">The constitutional rule devised by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth circuit, we think in this case, are dangerously simplistic because they ignore both the objectives of prison discipline and realities of prison life.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.517" offset="3406785">These rules, I think would severely damage the mission of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the inmates of that prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.790" offset="3427892">We have discussed in our brief the reasons, why the rules laid down by the Eighth Circuit should in any event not be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.461" offset="3458612">But I would leave that to the brief and discuss here, the rules and due process itself, because we are primarily concerned with the future impact of these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.443" offset="3494557">The basic error, we think in the opinion below was its mechanical application to prison disciplinary procedures of the procedural requirements laid down for a Parole and Probation revocation hearings by Morrissey against Brewer and by Gagnon against Scarpelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.906" offset="3556415">The Morrissey opinion of this court itself warned against this very error of thoughtlessly transposing rules, devised for one factual context to a totally different factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.364" offset="3602181">In Morrissey, this court stated that what processes do under varying circumstances is to be determined in the light of the private interest affected and the precise nature of the governmental function involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.258" offset="3649829">The Court of Appeals opinion, here I think discloses very little evidence of consideration of either those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.766" offset="3675847">We have outlined at pages 13 and 15 of our briefs, 13 through 15 of our brief, the similarities and the differences between the Morrissey, Scarpelli standards and the present Federal Bureau of Prison standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.310" offset="3729972">I want pause to discuss them in detail but I would call your attention to the fact that in many respects, the Bureau's procedures today meet the requirements laid down by Morrissey and Scarpelli.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.461" offset="3778560">Mr. Solicitor General, you said two factors, where you thought have been partially disregarded by the court of appeals and I missed those, what were they?</text>

            <text syncTime="933.680" offset="3811474">Those are the factors specified there Mr. Justice Stewart in Morrissey, for determining what processes do under varying circumstances and the first is the private interest that is affected, the deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.101" offset="3865182">The second is the precise nature of a governmental function involved, the governmental interest and that's in play in the field.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="962.998" offset="3928712">That the Bureau is sensitive to degrees of deprivation, I think is shown by the fact apparent from the chart on pages 13 to 15, that more procedural safeguards are provided for forfeitures of good time, which is a greater deprivation than for lesser disciplinary actions within the prison and that these procedures are effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.130" offset="4017319">I would suggest is shown by the fact that as the Bureau informs us, the Washington office reverses and remands from 20-25% of the good time forfeitures ordered within the prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.003" offset="4072803">I think that shows effectiveness and not the contrary because we all know that Federal Courts also have a reversal rights and we usually regard that as corrective and proper relative evidence of something, being wrong at a lower level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.395" offset="4122331">I would also point out --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1012.657" offset="4127347">I suppose it has a tendency to harmonize or homogenize, to effect of the treatment of prisoners and all the 60 odd federal prisons by having to review in Washington.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="1023.164" stopTime="1501.884">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="1023.164" offset="4169456">It does Mr. Chief Justice, they are certainly, obviously bound to differences and added to it them among various wardens and chief executive officers and federal installations and this procedure does just as you say tend to make uniform treatment with respect to forfeiture of good time and I would also emphasize that the lack of an automatic review and the lesser disciplinary actions in more a formal matter than a real matter because any prisoner or subject to a disciplinary action of any sort has available, the prisoner's mailbox through which he can send, uncensored, unread mail to any member of the executive branch, to the new attorney general or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, and any Congress, as a matter of fact to any judge and the result is that those claims are referred to the legal office of the Bureau of Prisons and they are reviewed there and often the legal officer in total investigates on the scene to determined the propriety of disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.007" offset="4408738">The principle differences between the standards of Morrissey and Scarpelli and present federal procedures lies in four areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.829" offset="4440085">The first is the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.434" offset="4458475">The second is the right to full disclosure in every case of all the evidence that maybe relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.108" offset="4481149">The third is the unqualified right to present witnesses of your own and the fourth of course is the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.669" offset="4511451">Those are rights that of course are associated with criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.802" offset="4531931">Parole and Probation revocations, I think, much more closely resemble criminal prosecution in their effect upon the individual's liberty than does a prison disciplinary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.744" offset="4579683">The individual and the former maybe as this court has put it condemned and suffered grievous loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.006" offset="4600790">The prison inmate is in a different position, he is already been convicted of a crime and is living in a prison and has already been deprived of liberty in the most pervasive manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.796" offset="4639974">He lives in fact in a thoroughly regulated and controlled society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.534" offset="4658887">When he is brought up for disciplinary action, he faces a range of sanctions, ranging from reprimand, temporary loss of television viewing time, perhaps a period in segregation at the utmost forfeiture of good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.000" offset="4720744">The deprivation he faces in that sense are minimal and not even on the same scale of magnitude as those faced by a man who is liable to be removed from free society and put behind prison walls, for a period of years, because I think the private interest affected in prison disciplinary actions doesn't suggest much less required, that Morrissey's, Scarpelli standards be applied to those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.442" offset="4818547">When we look at the other factor in the due process equation, there is the governmental function involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.012" offset="4840803">I think it becomes apparent in the prison setting, the Morrissey's, Scarpelli standards are not only, not appropriate, they are impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.377" offset="4882286">We could start by considering the asserted right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.167" offset="4909453">Suppose that an inmate observes other prisoners beat a man senseless or perhaps the observes group homosexual rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.940" offset="4936516">If that witness must be produced in a preliminary hearing, identified, confronted and cross-examined and then return to a prison population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.062" offset="4969012">It may be doubted that he will have a life worth living and in fact it may be doubted that hope he be allowed to continue to live his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.432" offset="4994508">The Federal Prisons as other prisons have had, just that episodes of the murder of inmate informers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.419" offset="5026377">Transfer to d other federal prisons doesn't solve the problem, because enough prisoners move between the prisons and the man is again identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.563" offset="5058978">We have had murders of men who had been transferred because they informed in a prior prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.754" offset="5087713">I think we should consider also what effect that kind of a procedure would mean for prison life for the rest of the prisoners and for the ability of the Bureau of Prisons to carry out admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.106" offset="5133166">Witnesses to prison violence or the acquisition of drugs, weapons or other contraband would simply cease to come forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.902" offset="5164408">They would be completely unwilling to subject themselves to identification and to reprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.636" offset="5187291">And without information on such matters would be impossible for the Federal prisons to maintain discipline and without that it would be impossible to try to affect rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.535" offset="5226893">The prisons would become in effect jungles ruled bands of violent inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.739" offset="5251657">Under such circumstances, I think the possibility of an existence for inmates that could be turned human would be impossible and certainly there would be no question of rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.727" offset="5283631">And I might point out, that the latest figures indicate that despite the fact, the Federal prisons are steadily receiving a tougher and more sophisticated band criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.830" offset="5324069">Still their recidivism rate is declining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.365" offset="5346220">I don't think the constitution can be interpreted to require that kind of inhumanity to the very prisoners, it is invoked to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.614" offset="5379239">It could be irony, I think if due process were interpreted to require slavery within the prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.186" offset="5401496">The right to counsel poses similar problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.534" offset="5414870">One of them sheer burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.854" offset="5424170">In fiscal 1973 there were 19,000 disciplinary proceedings within the Federal prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.348" offset="5458129">So the right to counsel would impose a staggering burden but more importantly, I think the presence of lawyers on both sides will change the procedure completely from one that is aimed towards rehabilitation to one that is aim towards confrontation and delay as the Scarpelli opinion self recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.705" offset="5523540">When you bring counsel into the informal proceeding and make a formal, you change the nature of the proceeding all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.908" offset="5560424">Changing these from rehabilitative and corrective procedures and rather informal discussions between an adjustment board and the prisoner is bound, and turning it into a confrontation between the accused and the prosecution is bound or polarize the prison community with a consequent increase in tensions and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.671" offset="5647464">I think we can see that in a minor scale, anyone who has lived for example, through the recent period of turmoil in the universities, knows what happens when ordinary and informal disciplinary processes are suddenly made formal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.069" offset="5701068">For the man, for rights and procedures is in itself a sign of anger, and when you are granted to a close community, the result is to ensure polarization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.852" offset="5740147">Every disciplinary trial in the law school becomes a contest between the student body and the faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.502" offset="5766792">When convictions occur disruptions break out, and that occurs in the best law schools in this country and it did, I think we can imagine what's going to happen in the federal prisons if we go through the same kind of a process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.091" offset="5809110">We have within the Federal prisons, a large body of men, many of whom have already demonstrated the propensity for violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.755" offset="5847771">I don't think therefore, these rights belong in the Federal Disciplinary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.507" offset="5874730">I would say merely a word about the prisoner of attorney mail matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.050" offset="5888940">In the Federal prisons, mail goes out unopened and unread to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.041" offset="5904927">Mail that comes in is examined only for contraband, money, drugs, weapons and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.493" offset="5938678">If the prisoner wishes and the attorney wishes, that mail would be opened only in the presence of the inmate so it can't be censored, it can't be read, only contraband can be discovered, I think that's the minimal safeguard and one that's entirely proper and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.298" offset="5997923">In some, the United States thinks that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit insofor as it applies Scarpelli and Morrissey rules should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.353" offset="6038152">As law we think in supportable, as penology we think it was disastrous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.020" offset="6192797">I think that perhaps a brief history of this case would be in order at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.560" offset="6219024">This case originally filed by Mr. McDonnel pro se in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska and it was really a broad scope and broad brush challenge to most of the rules, practices and procedures of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.722" offset="6287673">In fact the entire rule book is attached to as an exhibit to filing 42 which is the stipulation, back in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.285" offset="6321842">Several of challenges were settled by stipulation and appropriate order prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.907" offset="6344411">The mail was no longer stopped that was meant for judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.206" offset="6357577">Mail was no longer censored and deleted that was meant for judges, certain library rules were loosened and other relief was given by consent or by stipulation and appropriate order a trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.383" offset="6414315">However the case was appealed to United States court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit and then the plaintiff Mr. McDonnell filed a cross appeal after the state appeal from the Trial Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.606" offset="6471158">The State decided to file a petition for writ of certiorari to this Court following the Court of Appeal's decision and raised five questions but it appears as through that three really are the thrust of the state's discussion before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.414" offset="6550361">The first is should Morrissey and Scarpelli rules govern that present disciplinary hearing which may impose serious penalties or a grievous loss on an inmate be conducted in a fundamentally fair manner?</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.029" offset="6608875">Do the Morrissey Scarpelli procedures generally attached to present disciplinary hearings?</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.247" offset="6629773">The states concedes that when good time sentence credits are involved, the Morrissey Scarpelli procedures in a general fashion attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.299" offset="6673972">The Eight Circuit has outlined four of those generally that would attach. Good-time although after Preiser v. Rodriguez, could not be restored in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.383" offset="6722247">It's still in this action to the extent that it is a grievous loss or a substantial penalty which is present in every disciplinary hearing at the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex because good-time in Nebraska is conferred for good behavior and faithful performance of duties and when you are called up before the disciplinary committee because of an alleged misconduct, the finding of the investigation and the report of that committee when placed in the inmates file will affect the eligibility of that inmate to accumulate future good-time and to be eligible for consideration for release on parole or mandatory release under supervision at a certain time in a seconds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.372" offset="7962227">Alright thank you but if you will check Appendix 2 in the petition for certiorari you will see that the court made an expressed finding that it was a proper class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.654" offset="8019383">I would point out that in the amended complaint only the inmate class representative sought restoration of the good time that he was lost and the balance of the amended complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as to the legal rights and relations of the plaintiff inmate class and the persons who are named as party's defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.896" offset="8116349">The real thrust of the Morrissey and Scarpelli issues before the Court today can be find in the language in Morrissey that says that whatever that the State and the society has its stake in these cases whatever possibility there already is to return the inmate to a useful and normal life within the law, Morrissey goes on to to say that the state and society have no interest in having erroneous factual determinations which can impose or which find that a person has violated conditions are parole or prison conduct rules and the state or society has absolutely no interest in taking action in response to a finding of misconduct which factual record does not clearly indicate the response that is the required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.753" offset="8335778">Therefore it is really society's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.489" offset="8346749">There is perhaps paramount in this case because as the (Inaudible) case points out Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.635" offset="8383321">The society, a democratic one and the popular one will only continue to be effective when not only is justice done toward an individual but the community sees the justice has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.284" offset="8429923">Now when an inmate is called before the disciplinary hearing be it for substantial allegation of misconduct in which he can be placed in the whole or segregation, in which he can have a notation made in his record that will continually affect his eligibility for release under parole or some early release or when he has placed in the dry cell has anything taken against him in the prison that result in his being removed from the prison population and put in a solitary state where he is isolated from other prisoners, from the programs of the prison, from the privileges which would normally attach to his movement within the present society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.327" offset="8622080">I think these privileges parallel to some extent what the Chief Justice described as in the other enduring attachments of everyday life that are available to person when he is outside the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.163" offset="8677355">When the inmate comes before the disciplinary committee hearing and has these kinds of interests at stake then he faces a grievous loss in the substantial penalty in which our society has always held that due process is meant to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.742" offset="8735765">Why would the Bureau of Federal Prisons and States provide the real wealth of protections that are currently provided if that was not recognizing that it was one imposing a penalty on this individual or alleged misconduct or two; taking some action that substantially affected individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.709" offset="8819566">I would direct the Court's attention to Appendix A of the brief of the respondent which contains the chart that of a disciplinary proceedings which are currently given by the various penal systems in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.852" offset="8876199">It was prepared by a division of the American Bar Association and it sets out nicely and by percentages, what elements of disciplinary process are currently provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.791" offset="10143869">Now, the examples raised by the Solicitor General are interesting in that regard and they also get to this idea of the impossibility of giving fundamental fairness in a prison situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.112" offset="10441247">I would put it to court that if a man has written up for the kinds of situations described by Solicitor General, he is going to have a pretty good idea, if a guard didn't see it, that one of the members in the party told the administration about it, or that one of the members in the party told someone else about it, so he is going to get back to the participants one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.894" offset="10528287">This record, the record now before the court in the great majority of instances will disclose employees instigating a write-ups and in fact testimony of warden Wolf in the Appendix never once mentions an inmate instigating the write-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.678" offset="10591504">It talks about a supervisor or an employee seeing conduct that he believes is not proper conduct in initiating the write-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.131" offset="10637270">In that regard Mr. Kammerlohr couldn't bring a certified copy of the statue to the court but there are new rules at the Nebraska prison, which have been in effect since October of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.454" offset="10694531">I believe they are reflected in the chart which is in the Appendix in respondent's brief and they are also briefly discussed in Appendix-B to the respondent's brief which is a recapitulation of certain rights prepared by the New Jersey attorney journals office in a law suit there</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.064" offset="10760986">.Counsel substitute is not part of Nebraska proceeding and if the court will read Warden Wolf's testimony at one of the evidentiary hearings in this matter, the court will note that in the investigative stage of the Nebraska prison disciplinary proceeding, a corrections officer calls before him, the accused inmate and the person, they – and it's usually a job supervisor who gets the accused and he sits them down before them so that they may talk about the alleged misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.213" offset="10869551">Now, that is confrontation in a very real sense of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.073" offset="10885016">They are there together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.986" offset="10892643">The record does not really bare out in very much detail, what kind of cross-examination goes on, but I don't think that adversarial cross-examination is what anybody is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.734" offset="10939664">I think they are talking about a kind of testing of the evidence that this system, this Anglo-American system has always found necessary and has always found the only way to make factual determinations, when persons are to suffer a grievous loss, or any substantial penalty to their living condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.286" offset="11025868">As the Court pointed in -- I believe it's a footnote in Scarpelli, and I think it's a sound believe, the state has within its power to very creatively respond to the burdens, the constitutional burdens that this Court hands down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.131" offset="11085322">Because of what it feels is constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.574" offset="11095040">I have every confidence that not only the Bureau of Prisons but State of Nebraska and all other states can respond in a creative fashion to any constitutional mandate that this Court would hand down and all that we are talking about is basic fundamental fairness that to my thinking is the foundation upon which our system is constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.556" offset="11183020">The idea that some of the things that we are requesting in this case are in the antithesis of penology is subject to much debate in the organizing this case and indigent prisoner in Nebraska Complex does not have his command, the resources that certainly the Solicitor General and the United States government has in hand or for that matter the State in Nebraska has in hand and therefore the respondent had to assign some responsibilities and ask for some help in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.286" offset="11329933">On March 7th, we came to Washington and we had a meeting with certain groups that might be called public interest groups to assign and dwell out areas of responsibility on the briefs with the only thought in mind that, if we could prevent overlapping the amicus briefs that would save this Court's time in readings things that didn't read before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.167" offset="11413420">Therefore, I would specifically direct the Court's attention especially to the amicus brief of the National Counsel and Crime in delinquency which the respondent believes does answer some of the questions about sound penology which the Solicitor General has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.966" offset="11484578">That amicus brief in way of summary does point out that by reducing the sense of injustice felt by most prisoners, the provision of due process protections in disciplinary hearings alleviates prison tensions and enhances the possibility for a cooperative institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.301" offset="11561900">In 1870, the American Prison Administrator Society and the American Prison Association in its declaration of principles acknowledged that an inmate should plan integrable parties on rehabilitation and should take responsibility for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.943" offset="11636506">I believe that opening up prison disciplinary hearings and allowing for input and a testing and a more formalization of determinations of facts which will have a substantial impact on the prisoner, is what the American Prison Association was talking about in 1870.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.912" offset="11712366">There is an interesting notation in the case of (Inaudible) which involve John v. (Inaudible) who was at the time in segregation, he wrote a letter on September 30th of 1969 to his parents and he was later disciplined for that letter by the way, in which he was reacting basically to the fact that he was in solitary confinement and bitterment and the frustration and the complete rejection of the processes that had put him in a solitary confinement, I think really buttresses the National Counsel and Crime delinquency's argument that do not implement procedures which one, are designed to bring about fair results but two, are seen by the community at large to bring their results is do really dis-service in the American Correctional system that perhaps the constitution mandates nothing more than, and perhaps due perhaps mandates nothing more than that the nature at the time and the duration in the nature of a man's confinement bear some relation to the purposes of his commitment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.924" offset="12132415">I think the existing procedures or as I have them, there has been a thought that everything is staid, the mandate of this, of the Court Of Appeals that was staid holds everything in limbo and it's very difficult to know what is actually being done out there, but I believe what is being done is after the right, after the observance of misconduct, there is a formal write up of that incident, a notation made of it on a form that the prison has designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.954" offset="12252578">That form then goes to the Chief Corrections Officer and he looks at that form and he sees one who did the writing up or who has done the act, who was accusing the accusation, who has made the charge and two who is accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.479" offset="12310674">That is the Chief Corrections Officer's responsibility to conduct an investigation into the allegation of misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="4263.408" offset="17130371">First on the question of raising good time and problems, questioning good time in this civil rights action, what this case is, rather than habeas corpus proceeding as in as required by the Preiser versus Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.289" offset="17193900">I would like to merely point out to the court that in Preiser, as the court specifically points out, there was not only direct good time involved but these man, all of the petitioners, I believe as you were asking Mr. Justice Brennan, in that case, also did not accumulate good time while they were in segregation as result of the disciplinary proceedings for which they lost the good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.005" offset="17312810">So there are both, direct good time and the good time which they did not accumulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.876" offset="17336216">This court there said, nevertheless, you must bring a habeas corpus, unless you are asking for damages and of course the damage issue is not in this case either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.293" offset="17385953">Secondly, we answered the Eight Circuit when Preiser came out and they asked for a supplement and the State of Nebraska answered the Eight Circuit that we did have declaratory judgment remedy, mandamus remedy and asking mandatory injunction remedy, to question in the State courts whether or not good time was being deprived illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.777" offset="17491905">Since the good time is provided by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.451" offset="17510504">Next I would like to point out briefly, or emphasize one more time, that I think is a very serious question, whether an inmate has a grievous loss in any of these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.922" offset="17556480">I think his grievous loss is back when the court sentenced him to that penitentiary or when the Court decided to revoke that probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.625" offset="17599216">As this Court knows and must got an idea, we have come a long way on the question of what's cruel and unusual punishment, since the constitution and from disembowelment and (Inaudible) and all the various kind of punishment we used to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.428" offset="17666508">Well, I think the basic question really involved is a prison, or are some prisons cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
