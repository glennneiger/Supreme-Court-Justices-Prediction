            <text syncTime="46.720" offset="263628">Mr. Acting Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.235" offset="281704">This case is here on appeal from decision of a three-judge District Court or the District of New Mexico, enjoining the Secretary of the Interior from enforcing the employment preference for Indians in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, required by the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.334" offset="362057">The appellees and other preference acts, the appellees are non-Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, acting individually and as a bringing class action, who’ve been -- who claimed to have been denied promotion, because of the preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.480" offset="438648">They argue that the preference laws are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment that they’ve been tacitly, I suppose, repealed by the Equal Employment Opportunities Act of 1972 and that in any event they’re being interpreted too broadly by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.099" offset="513149">The Court held that the acts had been repealed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.407" offset="558393">The Court said that it could hold that the Acts were also unconstitutional, but it did not so hold and because of its holdings on these points, it didn’t have to reach the issue of the breadth of the application of the Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.473" offset="622655">The intervenor in this case is Amerind, an Association of Indian Employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who have the preference that’s under attack here.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.172" offset="681482">This case concerns the exercise by the Federal Government, by the Congress of the United States of its trust responsibility to tribal Indians and its effort to provide them an opportunity for self-determination and self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.693" offset="771553">I think that I can show to you that it’s not a racial discrimination involved in this case at all, but a determination to have the people whose property and lives are affected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have common role in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.064" offset="848980">Since we’re talking about a preference in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, I think it’s important for both issues of the case to give some facts about the Bureau of Indian Affairs, because I think it’s not well understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.486" offset="914704">There are only some 300 employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.034" offset="936856">There some 2000 others in offices, in Indian areas of the country, in Denver, Albuquerque, Billings, Montana, Phoenix, Muskogee, Oklahoma, and other places.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.298" offset="1081992">These are policemen on the reservations, the foresters who attend the Indian forest, irrigation workers, engineers, teachers, a good number of them are teachers, bus drivers, social workers, employment assistance personnel, house builders, there’s a housing program going on, and then there are a lot of employees who are in a kind of work program as a substitute for welfare program, where simply things that need to be done or done through hiring the people who live there to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.268" offset="2005786">And Mr. Sherman is prepared to deal in detailed with the Equal Opportunity Act of 1972, but rather than leave this hanging, the Act describes in some detail the outer limits of Section 717 of the Act, which is what is at issue here, described in some detail the outer limits of the Civil Service Commission’s Authority and it lists this agency, but not that agency to trace that.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.839" offset="2124069">For instance, there’s a problem with the general accounting of, there is no question that the Act intends to have it brought out or scope, cover everything in Civil Service, but there is a specific exception to the Civil Service Law, which I’ll explain for this Indian preference, back to Indian preference statute itself says this shall be so without regard to the civil service law and was done quite deliberately that way, it has been handled that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.977" offset="2256666">Now, I want to go back for a minute and talk about the reason for the Indian preference statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.683" offset="2295432">When sort of Romantic period of Indian law is the period before 1880, but by the 1880s, the Indian wars were about over, the Indians had been confined to reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.408" offset="2366380">They had been put on reservations, generally that didn’t give them enough water or land or resources to provide for their livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.727" offset="2411624">So they came in fact, as well as in legal theory, the wards of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.485" offset="2434717">The Federal Government didn’t feed them in those days, they didn’t eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.700" offset="2451540">There simply wasn’t enough to go around and there was an increasing period of federal responsibility for the Indian tribes, though the Indians had been promised in every treaty that they would have a certain level of independence and that though we can't say the day that their sovereign nations, some concept of sovereignty is behind that as Mr. Justice Marshall said in the McClanahan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.541" offset="2554880">What happened under this period of federal supervision and care was devastating to the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.874" offset="2596258">And by 1934, it had become one of the greater national scandals.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.870" offset="2628232">In the 1930s, after 50 years of guardianship, both the administration and Congress decided that there had to be some completely new system for handling Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.007" offset="2680790">Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Collier is testifying Congress in 1934, pointed out that during the years, between 1880s and 1934, during the years, when the Federal Government had the most responsibility, wars were over, that the Indians had been, and these are his words drifting towards complete impoverishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.549" offset="2766994">That they had been disorganized as groups, deliberately disorganized by the Federal Government as groups and pushed to lower social status as individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.435" offset="2806491">And that their land holdings had diminished and this is after they’d given up most of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.327" offset="2826031">This is -- their landholdings had diminished from 138 million acres in 1887 to 48 million acres in 1934 and something had to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.165" offset="2885381">The purpose of the Indian Reorganization Act was to reverse that trend towards destruction and not to strong award, by ending the Indian allotment policy, which had led land go first Indian hands and then, out of Indian hands.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.580" offset="3127066">Anyway, to end this abuse, was to terminate the Allotment Act to encourage Indian Governments on the reservation and there was a third part, and that was to make the Indian role a prominent in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.465" offset="3186625">There was an attempt at the classic problem of who guards the guardian and the Federal Government had failed as a plain guardian, and it was felt necessary to have the Indians participate strongly in guarding the guardians and self-help, doing their own work.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.107" offset="3273143">A more radical proposal was discarded, more radical proposal was to give the tribes an absolute veto or virtually an absolute veto of any Bureau of Indian Affairs person, who would be sent to reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.605" offset="3323193">But rather than do that, Congress decided on this proposal of giving the preference to Indians and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.462" offset="3370632">I have some nice examples of language from the congressional record pointing out the purpose for this, but I don’t think I’ll read them to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.833" offset="3408039">We have it on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.499" offset="3414727">As one of the pithier and shorter ones is by Senator Norbeck, who simply said, “I think we’ve utterly fallen down in the present system.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.431" offset="3446491">The Indian has been excluded. The reservation has built up with white people, who live of the Indians.”</text>
            <text syncTime="848.331" offset="3470106">And other statements attribute this directly to the workings of the Civil Service Law and Mr. Collier pointed out there are actually less Indians working for Indian progress in 1934 than in 1930 -- excuse me, than in 1900.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.977" offset="3544607">Less percentage of Indians because the Civil Service Law had served to weed out qualified Indians, who may not had been able to compete with hundreds of non-Indian applicants and there were many statements that the Indians should not have to compete with non-Indians for the jobs in their own service, and in controlling their own property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.538" offset="4122854">It’s a preference for the people, whose property and lives are affected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, who serve in that Bureau.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.726" offset="4191608">Now, we think it’s clear that the statute was not repealed by the Equal Employment Act of 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.060" offset="4397035">The legislative history shows not any intention to change the Indian preference and it’s in conceivable to us that Congress in Act setting out to increase minority participation in Government would have abolished the Indian preference without a word, saying that they’re doing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.859" offset="4908199">It said in the exercise of the war and treaty powers, the United States overcame the Indians and took possession of their lands, sometimes by force, leaving them uneducated, helpless, and dependent people, needing protection against the selfishness of others and their own of improvidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.619" offset="4979252">Of necessity, the United States assumed the duty of furnishing that protection and with it, the authority to do all that was required to perform that obligation and to prepare the Indians to take their places independent, qualified members of the modern body politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.352" offset="5054171">Then, actually in an earlier case, Perrin versus the United States, in upholding the laws as to sale of liquor to Indians on land next to reservation, the Court said that in determining what is reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians, Congress is invested with wide discretion in its actions, unless purely arbitrary must be accepted in given full effect by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.975" offset="5168692">Now, this -- I do not know that I would argue for that broader standard, but certainly that kind of standard is the test for this case that this an area that Congress has to deal with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.818" offset="5288020">Now one of the point and that is the way we analyze this case, this is not really an equal protection case, at all because equal protection refers to people, who are essentially in the same relationship to the Government, but the government then has passed laws to treat them in different ways and then, the Court uses its Equal Protection analysis to decide whether the difference in that treatment is justifiable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.627" offset="5779226">Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.820" offset="5796049">I would like to concentrate my comments on the question of whether the 1972 Civil Right Act repealed by implication the Indian Preference Statutes, as a lower court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.996" offset="5848712">Section 717 (a) of that Act by its express terms bar description based on race in the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.820" offset="5880059">Although nowhere in the terms the legislative history of that Act is there any intention expressed by Congress to repeal the Indian preference statutes, the District Court held that the BIA must come under the broad terms of the Act, and thereby repealed by implication of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.882" offset="5952261">Now, in my argument, I would first like to analyze the legislative background of the 1972 Act, which we believe without question shows that Congress could not have intended such a repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.048" offset="6000953">Secondly, I would like to explain why the BIA is not listed as an exception in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.041" offset="6024882">And lastly, I would like to touch on why we believe the District Court failed to apply basic rules of statutory construction, regarding repeal by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.854" offset="6068140">Now, if may first turn to the legislative background of the 1972 Act because I think this is extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.127" offset="6101264">The 1972 Act amended the 1964 Act, and by Section 717 (a), merely codified pre-existing, non-discrimination statutes or excuse me executive regulations that existed in the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.490" offset="6174720">The language of these pre-existing regulations in Section 717 (a) of the 1972 Act are virtually identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.618" offset="6215262">Now, we believe this is important, because these non-discrimination measures had stood side-by-side with the Indian Preference Statutes over the years and neither the executive branch nor legislature viewed Indian preference on the one hand and non-discrimination on the other hand has been inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.950" offset="6292584">And, for this very reason Congress may well thought, it was not necessary to make an exception for the BIA in the 1972 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.081" offset="6337097">Now, let me give some examples to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.524" offset="6346815">A beginning in the Roosevelt administration, there were executive regulations, which barred discrimination in the Federal Government, and there had been successive executive relations up to the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.811" offset="6396029">At the same time, because of the 1934 Indian preference statute, both the BIA and the Civil Service Commission have given special preferential rights to Indians, as opposed to non-Indians upon initial entry into the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.516" offset="6462798">Neither the Bureau nor the Civil Service Commission have seen these non-discrimination policies and Indian preference policies as being inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.398" offset="6502296">Now, another example of this is in 1964, when Congress passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.582" offset="6531030">In barring discrimination in private employment, Congress reaffirmed its belief in Indian preference, by exempting from the Act Indian tribes and private employers on or near reservations to allow preferential employment treatment for Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.673" offset="6599471">Congress did not view Indian preference on the one hand, and non-discrimination on the other hand, as being inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.124" offset="6633221">Even in 1972, three months, only three months after the 1972 Civil Rights Act was passed, Congress passed new Indian preference statutes, giving preferences to Indian teachers and Indian educators in special Indian education programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.163" offset="6705424">Congress in no way saw any inconsistency between these new preference Acts in 1972, and the Civil Rights Act that it had just passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.023" offset="6744816">Now, I want to turn for a moment to the legislative history of the 1972 Act, Mr. Sachse has pointed that nowhere in the terms of the Act or in its legislative history, which is voluminous, the Congress in any way say anything about its desire to repeal a 138 years of special Indian preference programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.691" offset="6827468">Surely, had Congress intended to do so, it would have said something, especially in view of its recent affirmation in 1964 and in 1972, with these new Indian preference laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.312" offset="6878041">I think at the very least Congress would amended the 1964 Indian preference statute to do away with the private preferential right that it given to Indians, if it intended to take away the right it given in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.627" offset="6935301">Now, the logical question to all these is why didn’t Congress include an exemption for the BIA in the 1972 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.735" offset="6971664">Well, we can always speculate on that, since there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.675" offset="6995487">But, I think the most plausible explanation is that Congress simply felt that Indian preference was not inconsistent with the general non-discrimination prohibitions and therefore it wasn’t necessary to create an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.961" offset="7056614">Now, one reason for this and I stress this is for the same reason Mr. Sachse brought out, these Indian preference statutes as we interpret them are basically not racial statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.441" offset="7102485">The thrust of the Indian Preference Act was to give self-determination to Indian people, people whose lives are controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.439" offset="7138534">Now, as Mr. Sachse point out there are many Indians whose lives are not controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.797" offset="7159954">Those Indians, even if they are full-blooded Indians don’t qualify for Indian preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.967" offset="7180643">So in that sense, the Indian preference laws are more based on a federal tribal recognition or tribal affiliation, not on the fact that one is or is not an Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.052" offset="7224947">And, in that sense, we do not believe that Congress thought that these statutes were based on a racial classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.828" offset="7460049">Now, I think in addition to what I have just said, I think an additional reason for the BIA not being part of this 1972 Act was that the thrust of the 1972 Act was to strengthen Civil Service Commissions and tie discrimination measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.895" offset="7528281">And this 1934 Act, as Mr. Sachse has said was instituted giving Indians preferences “without regard to Civil Service Laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.287" offset="7569868">We don’t think Congress meant to do away with those preference statutes when it passed the 1972 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.205" offset="7593587">Now, I want to say that there is an alternative explanation to why the Bureau doesn’t appear in the Act and that is simply because it is very, very possible that Congress overlooked the Bureau or overlooked Indian preference when it considered the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.166" offset="7649384">I think there’s good evidence to that in the sense that there’s not one word, anywhere in the legislative history that mentions the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian preference statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.058" offset="7844989">But that’s in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.229" offset="7849691">We are dealing here with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service which is an [Voice Overlap] I also want to deal briefly with the issue of statutory construction as it applies to repeal by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.239" offset="7909669">Appellees have contended that the terms of the Indian Preference Statute and the Civil Rights Act of 1972 are in conflict, and thus, the Indian Preference Statutes because their earlier statutes must give way to the latter statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.631" offset="7971318">Now, quite to the contrary, the rules of this Court generally have been that repeal by implication of a special statute by a general statute will not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.483" offset="8022727">Now, I want to stress that in our view, this Indian Preference Statutes without question are special statutes, they only apply to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service and in only in a very limited way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.862" offset="8068180">On the other hand, the 1972 Civil Rights Act without question is a general statute. It applies to virtually the entire Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.645" offset="8103288">Now, if the terms of the special and general statutes are in conflict, the prior special statute will normally become an exception to the general statute, unless the legislative history of the general statute could be demonstrated to have expressly intended to repeal the earlier statute which clearly is not the case here because we don’t have one word relating to intentional repeal Indian preference or if the basic goal of the general statute would be entirely defeated, if the earlier legislation were to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.802" offset="8231915">Now the 1972 Civil Rights Act stands almost in its entirety intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.055" offset="8252918">It applies virtually all agencies of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.831" offset="8264098">As a matter of fact, it applies to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.408" offset="8278413">Racial discrimination, sex discrimination, religious discrimination in the Bureau of Indian Affairs is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.967" offset="8304640">Only when an Indian and a non-Indian compete for a vacancy and the Indian is qualified for that job and he is from a federally recognized tribe does he received the preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.149" offset="8349362">Otherwise, the 1972 Civil Rights Act in all other respects applies to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.389" offset="8378305">Now, lastly, I would like to just comment on what concerns the Appellant Amerind greatly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.926" offset="8408503">If Indian preferences be repealed or which to be found unconstitutional, we believe this would have a devastating effect on the Bureau or Indian Affairs and on Indian Employment and I would like to briefly explain this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.701" offset="8467540">Our brief does go into the fact that almost all Indians in the Bureau of Indian Affairs enter the Indian service through what is called the accepted service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.668" offset="8507455">This is a special exemption by which Indians, they have to be qualified, but they do not have to take civil service examinations and they don’t have to place their names on federal employment registers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.171" offset="8553430">Now the reason for this accepted service was that the 1934 Congress realized that civil service examinations had long excluded qualified Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.168" offset="8597420">They simply did not measure Indian ability, Indian potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.472" offset="8614661">So the accepted service was setup and the authority for the accepted service in the BIA was none other than this 1934 Indian Preference Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.081" offset="8649038">So, what concerns us is if you take away Indian preference, then you in turn take away the accepted service and that has been the major vehicle by which, literally thousands of Indians have been able to come in to their own service and work for their own people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.762" offset="8711837">And as Exhibit A of our reply brief shows that the study by the Civil Service Commission of Indians and other federal Indian agencies in two popular states, Arizona and New Mexico, Indians have been virtually shut out of those agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.932" offset="8776516">As that report explains, one of the reasons is that Indians have not been able to compete successfully for civil service examinations which don’t measure their true ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.479" offset="8814655">We are very worried this same thing would happen to the BIA if preference were taken from Indians and if the accepted service were taken from Indians and that clearly would defeat the congressional intent of allowing Indian self determination in their own affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.897" offset="8876304">So in sum, we believe that if the lower court had carefully considered the legislative background of the 1972 Act which it did not and if the lower Court had applied basic rules of statutory construction relating to special and general statutes which it did not, Indian preference would have been allowed to stand and we believe that the decision of the lower court should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.773" offset="8971807">I have nothing further unless the Court has some questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.484" offset="9078700">The first one being whether or not the 1972 Equal Employment Opportunity Act repealed the 1934 Indian Preference Acts by implication or whether that tacitly did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.523" offset="9138887">The second question I think that is presented to the Court is whether or not the Indian preference acts passed some 40 years ago, I am talking specifically about the 1934 Act Your Honors, is violative of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.626" offset="11775269">In 1972 or shortly thereafter, it became a policy of the Department of the Interior and in the Bureau of Indian Affairs to advance the Indian employees of the BIA over the non-Indian employees of the BIA and they were, as we maintain here today, subsequently discriminated against because of that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.194" offset="11873489">And this is one of the reasons why this case has come before this Court so that this Court can determine whether or not the actions taken by BIA at that time are in fact constitutional or unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.590" offset="11935138">With regard to the argument about the 1972 Act repealing by implication the 1934 Indian Preference Statute Your Honors, I would like to point out this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.947" offset="11980487">That at no time, at no time, Your Honors, during the course of the briefs or during the course of the argument that we have heard from the appellants, do the appellants at all deny that the Indian employees of BIA are government employees and subject to the rules and regulations laid down in the statutes that we are talking about here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.309" offset="12081946">There has been no objection and no exception either in the Court below or before this Court that they are government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.847" offset="12120085">Now, the 1964 Equal Employment Opportunity Act, which apply to private employers, contained an exception for Indians living on or near a reservation, and I pointed that out that this exception was made for those businesses or enterprises operating on or near a reservation with a publicly announced policy, Your Honors, of aiding and assisting Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.460" offset="12238576">Eight years later, in 1972, when they took the 1964 Act and applied it to federal employees, there is no exception in the Act with regard to BIA or BIA employees, none, Your Honors, it is absolutely absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.935" offset="12336483">In the briefs, I have pointed out that as a matter of congressional record, both Senator Bird of West Virginia and also Senator Humphrey of the State of Minnesota, have made extensive remarks during the course of the passage of the 1972 Act applying to all federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.608" offset="12419135">And I think that Senator Bird’s remarks are probably even more apropos here than in any other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.318" offset="12450064">He said, “I do not favor special treatment or special consideration or favored employment of any individual on the basis of that person's being black or white or male or female.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.455" offset="12494576">Not withstanding what I have just said, the fact remains that discrimination in employment on the basis of race does exist and discrimination against sex does persist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.201" offset="12537522">Wherever there is such a discrimination in employment, it is violative of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.313" offset="12561972">In other words, he should rise or fall on the basis of merit, not on the basis of his race or religion or sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.900" offset="12600320">Every qualified individual, whether he be black, white or else, should be given an equal chance and not preferential treatment in an employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.864" offset="12644206">We would also like to point out to the Court that Section 105 of Title V of the United States Code specifically lists therein, Your Honors, Executive Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.802" offset="12700003">Now, Executive Department includes the Department of the Interior and is referred to and included in Section 717 of the 1972 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.517" offset="12754860">Now if Congress had not intended to refuse to make an exception based upon race in government employment, why would they include it in the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.504" offset="12818808">In other words, Congress did not intend to exclude namely Indian preference that which they specifically included in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.699" offset="12875546">When the appellants argue, Your Honors, that the 1972 Act is a general statute and the Indian Preference Statutes are specific legislation and that therefore, the latter should be upheld in resolving conflicts, I think we are talking about semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.054" offset="12956944">They both cover the same principle that we are talking about here, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.928" offset="12976483">They both cover government employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.078" offset="13001038">They are of equal import.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.492" offset="13010756">They should be read together and if the conflict cannot be resolved between the two, then the most recent civil rights legislation giving us freedom from discrimination based upon sex, race, creed or color is the one that should be upheld and not vice versa, an Indian Preference Act passed 40 years ago, when the situation today is much different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3943.780" offset="15851833">An Indian is defined in these series of Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.012" offset="15880777">Section 479 of 25 U.S.C. defines Indians for the purpose of this Indian preference as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.982" offset="15916722">An Indian as used in these Sections including Indian preference shall include all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.171" offset="15989447">And all persons who are descendant of such members who were on June 1, 1934 residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.637" offset="16087249">When we are talking about whether or not an Indian person is a member of a tribe, some tribes require a blood quantum, some do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.128" offset="16129254">But as far as the Preference Acts that we are talking about here, Your Honor, are concerned, they have to have -- they are supposed to have one-half or more Indian blood, but there is no objection and there is no argument on the part of the appellants that they are in fact applying a one-quarter Indian blood test to exercise these preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.274" offset="16233848">And I don’t believe that there has ever been argument by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Secretary that they are not applying that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.172" offset="16281391">Now, when they passed this Act, and this is I think very, very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.010" offset="16308767">When Congress passed this Act in 1934 giving Indians preference, they said in Section 478 of Title 25 U.S.C., Sections 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466 through 470 and 471 through 473, and that includes the Indian preference because 472 is the Indian preference, of this Title shall not apply to any reservation wherein the majority of the adult Indians voting at a special election duly called by the Secretary of the Interior shall vote against its application.</text>

            <text syncTime="4323.019" offset="17368816">That case decided an issue of whether or not the Tax Exemption Statutes were violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4347.664" offset="17467455">It did not involve the dispute between property rights of Indians and non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.719" offset="17495667">It had to do with something entirely different than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.705" offset="17515520">The other case that is cited by the appellants in their briefs and during their argument I think Your Honors, none go to the point in issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.561" offset="17555017">There are the points in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.916" offset="17564421">It is a proposition and a stand from the proposition that the Indians have a different and probably a very unique position with regard to other people in the United States of America, but it does not decide whether or not you can deprive a government employee in the BIA advancement in his position when he is qualified because of an Indian Preference Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.539" offset="17690854">We believe that that is contrary to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and it is a distinction based upon race.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.727" offset="17731605">We are talking about one quarter Indian blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.347" offset="17750100">When we start talking about blood, we are talking about race here, Your Honors and I think that that is clearly the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.270" offset="17781864">That this is strictly a racial preference and this is strictly a preference based upon race and nothing more or less than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.117" offset="17833169">Finally, Your Honors, I would like call the Court’s attention to the case of Griggs versus Duke Power Company in 401 U.S. 424.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.179" offset="17881443">At page 400 of that opinion, the Chief Justice who, unfortunately is not with us here today, wrote an opinion and part of that opinion I think is very, very pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.056" offset="17944973">It says that Congress did not intend by Title VII however, to guarantee a job to every person regardless of qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.242" offset="17981753">In short, the Act does command that any person be hired simply because he was formerly the subject of discrimination or because he is a member a minority group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.680" offset="18027520">Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.167" offset="18065450">What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate insidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification and that is precisely I think, Your Honors what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.472" offset="18154684">If there are no further questions from this Court, we confidently submit our case to you for your consideration, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
