            <label>Mr. Karl J. Stipher</label>
            <text syncTime="13.886" offset="132284">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.653" offset="143360">21 other lawyers and I am from the State of Indiana represent the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.473" offset="166661">The Honorable Cale J. Holder, Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.134" offset="193306">The general question presented to the Court today involves the correctness of the order of Judge Holder prohibiting William Kunstler from representing a criminal defendant Arthur Banks in the case pending in the Southern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.886" offset="260284">On December 14, 1972, Banks an inmate of the Federal Penitentiary of Terre Haute was charged with the assaulting a guard at the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.249" offset="309708">Thereafter on March 21, Kunstler an out-of-state lawyer, who was submitted to practice in New York, filed an application for leave to appeal on behalf of Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.354" offset="354116">At the request of the Government, a hearing was held and Judge Holder denied the application of Kunstler to represent Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.134" offset="389329">Kunstler then filed the mandamus action against Judge Holder in United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which order Holder to vacate his order and to permit Kunstler to represent Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.896" offset="440320">A petition for rehearing in the Banks case was denied by the Seventh Circuit by a vote of four to three, and then this case came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.078" offset="493087">Judge Holder denied Kunstler the right to represent Banks in this case because of numerous delays in the trial caused by Kunstler and because Kunstler after being retained as counsel for Banks, made statements to public audiences, and news media in violation of the rules of ethics of the American Bar Association and in violation of Rule 27 of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.625" offset="607295">The following statements were made by Kunstler to public audiences and news media while this case was pending in the Southern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.455" offset="646583">Kunstler said that his client Banks was assaulted by the prison guards, that the charge against Banks is purely reiterative.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.405" offset="682318">A cheap little way of getting back at him in being for being a troublemaker and I am, if you want to look at our brief on Page 6, I am referring to the statements where they are contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.867" offset="724219">Kunstler was ascertain that Banks was brutalized by the guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.701" offset="739579">That it was a common cover up tactic in order to protect the guards to file charge against Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.707" offset="763611">That all the evidence is inside the prison walls under the control of the authorities who brought the charges against Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.987" offset="792660">The word of the guard is always taken over that of an inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.197" offset="809587">That Banks got into all this trouble because he does not act like most to the black inmates who Uncle Tom it inside, but there is a lot of antagonism against Banks because his wife is White.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.885" offset="864340">That Attorney Kunstler urged students at Terre Haute to organize demonstrations and supported Banks and to fill of Courtroom with sympathetic spectators during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.834" offset="904046">That anything they can do to call attention to the trial will be welcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.066" offset="920973">I am not asking them to blow up the Courthouse by that certainly would draw attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.998" offset="944692">Of course he was quited as being proud to be associated with Mr. Banks as he represents the finest of the pacifists of anti war movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.687" offset="979487">That Mr. Banks is a black man who was sent to jail for his beliefs in the value of human life and the dignity of all the people at a time when many who have much more to defend choose alternatives to incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.383" offset="1034240">That Mr. Kunstler sees this indictment as a political attack by the Prime, by the prison administration on an individual who firmly stands for his beliefs, who was articulate and spokesman for the black liberation of pacifism, and therefore a threat to the smooth running of suppression that is so much a part of prison life in this country today.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.894" offset="1120340">That Mr. Kunstler has reported has saying “This case typifies the strategy used to quiet dissent among the inmates for the case as such, that due process is virtually an impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.879" offset="1168300">The moment, he Banks, went into prison he was doomed.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.626" offset="1183242">The only successful way to defend yourself against charges such as those against Banks is by creating a complete support group around the trial that includes demonstrations and making sure every court session has a full house and listing celebrities who are interested in the case and Kunstler had a comment concerning draft evaders in granting of amnesty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="300.407" offset="1278328">Those were the statements that were made by Mr. Kunstler while this case is pending for trial in the Southern District of Indiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.728" offset="1915611">After Judge Holder ruled against Kunstler and while the case was pending in the Seventh Circuit on mandamus, Kunstler made the following statements at a speech at Indiana University Law School at Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.777" offset="1971827">On a personal level, I was deeply shocked by it because if the pending case involving respondent Banks was the first time in any federal case that I have ever heard a United States District deny an attorney the right to represent the person who desires his services.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.061" offset="2032953">It was done in a cold and in criminal manner by a Judge Holder, who in doing so committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.626" offset="2071301">He violated the Civil Rights of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.537" offset="2082900">Under any ordinary set of circumstances, if a law was just an honest he should be indicted for what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.049" offset="2112993">He violated his oath of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.440" offset="2122501">He violated his oath as a member of the profession and he violated every tenant of human decency of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.822" offset="2152072">Write a letter to the Judge, write a letter to a newspaper, pick up the Courthouse do anything that will contribute to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.239" offset="2177672">There is a committee here for Arthur Banks and anyone that was any information about that can reach the committee through the law offices Barnhart Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.944" offset="2204526">Then following that there was a taped interview in which Mr. Kunstler made the further remarks about Judge Holder, who was presiding Judge at this District where the trial would be held and has not yet been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.362" offset="2270145">The Judge here, Judge Holder has said that he is not going to permit me to appear in his Court which means that I can’t represent Arthur Banks which means that I am disbarred as far as this Court is concerned and he has doing it for no good reason whatsoever other than his own in a prejudice against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.812" offset="2339944">It would seem to me any lawyer worth his or her salt would be writing to the editor, writing to the Bar Association, writing to the Judge, writing to the Court of Appeals to Seventh Circuit and saying “Look here we may or we may not agree with William Kunstler, but that is not the issue before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.525" offset="2394802">The issue is are we going to rape the Constitution by allowing a Federal Judge to do what the constitution says he should never do and that’s to deprive the defendant of his right to an Attorney of this choice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="591.699" offset="2443494">I do not think anyone should respect the law, not certainly as it's practiced in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.582" offset="2467109">If the law is neither fair nor just because it is manipulated and utilized and in it is own procedures and practices is unfair as well deal in deliberately.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.608" offset="2507128">I think into the system, I think the best use is to distrust it, strip it up all of its mysticism, to demonstrate to fill Courtrooms to confront it.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.047" offset="2548924">We would thinking nothing peculiar at all about picking Congress or picking a White House, why not pick up to Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="694.887" offset="2856333">I know he has looked at the crystal ball, but what had been done would indicate to him that a further reason for him denying the right to appear with what he was his going to do in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.888" offset="2936268">Now after that was done, Banks then filed a habeas corpus proceeding in the same case before another the Federal Judge in our District, Judge Dillon and this case was still pending in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit involving Holder and Dillon.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.050" offset="3028950">Dillon denied the habeas corpus because he felt that it had been made of proper and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.296" offset="3057894">And Kunstler then under took to make these further statement in public about Judge Dillon.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.434" offset="3090495">I think it is a frightful thing that has been done to him by the Government of United States, the American Bar Association and the reason he is complaining about that is American Bar Association has filed a amicus brief in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.837" offset="3148069">21 of the so called prestigious Indiana Lawyers who filed against him and I guess I am one of those, a United District Judge by the name of Dillon who has being sought to be impeached because integration decree in Indiana and while I would oppose his impeachment on those grounds, I would whole heartedly support it for what he his done to the black man in Terre Haute.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.802" offset="3239915">He has violated his oath of office and he has denied this man the most fundamental of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.990" offset="3260709">I am reading from the brief, he has ignored his, Page 9, he has ignored his habeas corpus, he has succeeded installing his case long enough for the government to catch up with Judge Rehnquist in Washington and to put his case in Limbo where he cannot move and those who say to American citizens trust in the system and do adopt alternative methods may some day remember this case along with others when people refused to trust the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.500" offset="3374707">It is about the worst instance in the career, in my career of some 25 years that I have ever seen Judge Hoffman pales into insignificance when you compare him to Judge Dillon because Judge Hoffman was at least honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.397" offset="3430296">Judge Dillon is a fraud and I think he has done an enormous to justice to Arthur Banks and he probably has done it because he is trying to avoid the anger of the citizens of Indiana for his integration decree and so he is to decided destroy Arthur Banks in order to get back on the establishment's bandwagon.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.464" offset="3502602">It is a very sad and desperate thing I think that a Federal Judge would violate his oath of office in this fashion but I guess it is not unexpected since President of the United States does it regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.537" offset="3542936">Well, in this case it is in alliance between the United States Government and the American Bar Association, and the Indiana Bar of what they called prestigious man of the Indiana Bar and the Federal Judges in this District, Judge Holder, Judge Dillon and the others and it is vicious cycle, one feeds in to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.278" offset="3609809">It is a criminal conspiracy to subvert the constitution and these men like Dillon and Holder are criminals and it is just too bad that the American people do not recognize who the real criminals are in their midst.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.107" offset="3657143">They are not in the terrible prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.937" offset="3668532">Now, admittedly those statements he made attacking our Federal Judges in the Southern District of Indiana occurred after Judge Holder’s hearing, but keep in mind that this man, his trial has not yet taken place and one of these days there is going to be a trial and I think all these matters should be -- were before the Court of Appeals and should be before this Court in making a determination as to whether or not Mr. Kunstler will be able to represent this man during the trial. Other reasons for denying of course the right to participate in this trial represent have to do with delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.964" offset="3836656">We’ve covered that in our brief and I won’t bother you that with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.765" offset="9483807">And one day after Judge Holder, filed a responsive pleading to that, he filed it actually a day after the mandamus was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.709" offset="9523618">The Seventh Circuit ordered that he file with it the transcript of the entire proceeding which is actually had been held before Judge Holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.185" offset="9577535">That was done and it was based upon a study of that transcript, the Seventh Circuit decided this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.704" offset="9619540">One of the difficulties that I think in fact been had in this case is the petitioner’s brief and its argument this morning, completely ignores the existence of that transcript because it is only there that one begins to find out the reality of what this case was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.237" offset="9701669">And it’s because of our conviction of the decisive nature of the content of that transcript that we called to be Xeroxed filed with clerk of the Court deliberately to each of the Justices a copy of that transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.422" offset="9758407">Because it’s to that particular point, it is at that particular point that you begin to see that what the case involved was far beyond different from the statements of my adversary as to this innumerable statements which finally boil down to a series of statements on February 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.928" offset="9844506">The issue which emerged in that particular transcript was there was an extraordinary colloquy between Judge Holder and Mr. Kunstler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.443" offset="9894557">Judge Holder forced Mr. Kunstler to disclose his views on number of matters having nothing to do with this particular case, matters having to do with the draft, amnesty and questions of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.760" offset="9963833">Having forced to disclosure of these views in open court, Judge Holder then turned to Mr. Banks and said, do you want a monkey on your back?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.492" offset="10014720">The monkey being, Judge Holder’s estimate of Mr. Kunstler’s views and a rather eloquent statements which appears in the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.068" offset="10061009">Mr. Banks made absolutely clear that he carried many monkeys on his back before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.307" offset="10094028">That he knew exactly what Mr. Kunstler’s views were and he wished him to be his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.017" offset="10128823">Following that, Judge Holder decided that Mr. Banks was not to have Mr. Kunstler as his lawyer, but rather another present selected by Judge Holder whom he described as having proclivities and operations with which I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.839" offset="10228088">Banks said, he was going to stand mute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.971" offset="10240627">He wanted the lawyer of his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.091" offset="10265078">It is pretty obvious to us, the lawyer of the defendant’s choice is not a lawyer of the Judges’ choice and the fact that the Judge may find another lawyer in the Indianapolis or Terre Haute, whom he would like to have represent Mr. Banks can’t be allowed to pass in the face of the Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3687.797" offset="14827938">Indeed they’re under special responsibility do exercise fearlessness in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.561" offset="14846955">But when a lawyer goes before a public gathering and fiercely charges that the trial in which is a participant is unfair that the judge lacks integrity, the circumstances under which he speaks now only sharpen what he says but he imports to his attack inflaming and warping significance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.265" offset="14913829">He says that the very Courtroom in which he walks to plead his cases a travesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.521" offset="14934831">That the procedures and reviews established to protect his client from such conduct to a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.794" offset="14955938">No matter how narrowly conceive this rule maybe has been betrayed by a lawyer who has engaged in kind of conduct here found by the Hawaiian Court.</text>
