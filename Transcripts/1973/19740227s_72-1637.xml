            <text syncTime="9.868" offset="116193">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.928" offset="144509">It involves a charge by a union, that the employer of Magnavox Company, the respondent committed an unfair labor practice in not allowing the distribution to employee in the plant, not on the company time, but off hours of literature concerning the campaign for or against the union that was coming up for reelection.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.286" offset="305842">The Board held that it was an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.322" offset="318067">The Court of Appeals refused the enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.677" offset="343458">We include that the Court of Appeals was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.093" offset="365087">We reverse the judgment, holding that it involved Section 7 rights for and against union in that the solicitation, not on working our time but it can -- or in working placements on company's property was under circumstances of this case proper for the Board to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.671" offset="491416">The opinion has been by Mr. Justice Stewart dissenting in part, and he is joined by Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
