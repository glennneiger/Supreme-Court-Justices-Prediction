            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="9.672" offset="115461">This case comes before us on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.517" offset="138867">Respondent Donnelly was tried in Massachusetts State Court for first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.883" offset="160287">During the course of his trial, one of Donnelly's co-defendants elected to plead guilty to a lesser charge and the Trial Judge advised the jury that he had pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.223" offset="197590">Respondent's trial then continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.695" offset="207517">In the closing argument, the prosecutor made a statement which respondent has contended denied him due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.221" offset="233639">The prosecutor said they, meaning respondent and his 00:43 said that they hope you find them not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.201" offset="265509">I quite frankly think that they hope you find him guilty of something a little less than first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.464" offset="290586">The Court upon request gave specific instructions to disregard this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.854" offset="308140">Respondent was convicted by the jury and his conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Massachusetts Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.727" offset="335621">Respondent then sought habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court where the writ was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.529" offset="358818">He appealed to the First Circuit which reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.995" offset="368744">That Court reasoned that the prosecutor’s remarks when combined with the guilty plea of respondents co-defendant, would probably have conveyed to the jury a notion that respondent had also sought to enter guilty plea, but he had been refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.380" offset="422243">To create this impression, said the Court was a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.263" offset="441783">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.316" offset="454008">Although the prosecutor’s remark was considered improper by all the courts which passed upon it, we don't believe that this single, somewhat ambiguous statement when viewed in the context of the entire trial and particularly the instruction from the Trial Judge that the statement was unsupported by any evidence in the record and should be disregarded, denied the respondent due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.045" offset="540944">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice White has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.115" offset="561215">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion in Part 2 of which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
