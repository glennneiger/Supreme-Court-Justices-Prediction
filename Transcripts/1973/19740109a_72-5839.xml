            <text syncTime="26.439" offset="182544">This case arises from State of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.212" offset="197590">It was a three-judge federal court below that held a state statute in the State of West Virginia as being constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.457" offset="230609">That statute provides that one who seeks to appeal from a hearing and a judgment or a justice of the peace in the State of West Virginia, it required to posts a double bond, a bond twice the amount of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.960" offset="296542">We challenge that as unconstitutional denying Equal Protection and Due Process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.345" offset="322142">Before I begin with the merits of the case, I would like to deal with the subject of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.509" offset="342831">We have made the unusual move perhaps for an appellant whose bringing the case before the Court, of suggesting that our case may be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.442" offset="374491">I would like to point out to the Court that I am not arguing for mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.354" offset="394136">I am fulfilling what I believe is my duty to the Court, and informing the Court of all the issues and all the circumstances of the case, that there was a case in the State of West Virginia that went to the State Supreme Court in West Virginia that was virtually identical, practically it’s not much different.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.083" offset="473130">That case raised same issues as are presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.527" offset="490893">The West Virginia Supreme Court declared the judgment of the justice of the peace in that case void.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.549" offset="526942">Another case, an older case of the West Virginia Supreme Court said that when you have a pecuniary interest of a justice of the peace in his judgment, then the judgment is void ab initio, that was in a criminal context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.082" offset="4949055">That’s possible, but that’s not the way the statute was set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.458" offset="4962534">If you look at the second half of that statute, and I think you are going to have to construe them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.195" offset="4993567">The second half of the statute is also an appeal statute, double bond to appeal an eviction plus one year’s rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.578" offset="5031079">That means that when this statute was enacted, this was what was anticipated by the legislature that it would only take one year to appeal a decision of a JP.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.689" offset="5075487">It would not take any longer than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.785" offset="5083847">In addition to which, we have a two-term rule in the State of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.088" offset="5101087">That is, if you appeal from a JP to a court of record, you’ve got to bring that on for hearing within two terms of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.760" offset="5131807">That’s within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.172" offset="5137450">So when you take it in that frame of reference, it’s not going to be any longer than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.140" offset="5161273">When you look at the statute itself, the second half of the statute, which refers to one year’s rent in an eviction situation, plus the two-term rule, then it’s very reasonable to assume that the interest will not be more than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.911" offset="5232431">I would like to return again to the compelling state interest argument that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.359" offset="5254165">We suggest that there’s not equal treatment in the two systems, in the court of record system or in the justice peace system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.121" offset="5293244">You have a bias, which is built into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.996" offset="5304738">The Reece case bares us out on that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.313" offset="5318008">You do have an admitted JP based with a question of law and he is not an expert in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.607" offset="5351131">We have in the same situation, a person who has the money can afford to go into a court of record, he can post that bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.168" offset="5397420">Whereas, an indigent cannot post a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.144" offset="5409332">I realize this raises the question of wealth classification, and this Court is not seem fit to go so far as to say compelling state interest standard applies to wealth classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.922" offset="5448411">But what I’m suggesting is, it’s just not the wealth classification and there is something more here than the wealth classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.286" offset="5473907">That is the unequal treatment in the two court systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.784" offset="5491879">When you have concurrent jurisdiction, creditor could have gone into either one of those courts, it’s his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.573" offset="5519047">He could go into either court of record system where my client would’ve had a learned judge who is not biased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.021" offset="5544856">He had -- no fees were going to be accrued to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.927" offset="5560424">Then the compelling state interest state standard applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.189" offset="5581531">And it’s -- the burden of course then of the state to show that there is a compelling state interest for the discrimination on the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.858" offset="5612147">We also suggest that this is like the Boddie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.698" offset="5635553">I’m not saying that this is a Boddie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.619" offset="5643180">We’re not saying that the contract creates a fundamental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.072" offset="5665019">What we’re saying is that equal treatment in the court is a fundamental interest, like the fundamental interest found in Boddie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.743" offset="5699709">Boddie stands alone that’s clear from Kras and Ortwein decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.333" offset="8502126">In that case, we had basically the same issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.950" offset="8520516">We had a justice of the peace who had a statutory fee due him, which was $2.50 on each case or each judgment that he executed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.558" offset="8583001">The court in justice -- in Reece versus Geis ruled that because of this $2.50 fee, it was a pecuniary interest that the JP possessed, and therefore the JP was disqualified from giving a judgment on the case and as a result that judgment that he did give because of this pecuniary interest was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.272" offset="8677878">Now, we contend now that Reece versus Geis does apply to the instant case, and therefore, Warner -- Justice Warner in this case, his judgment as to Patterson is likewise void.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.814" offset="9975954">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.493" offset="9982746">I would suggest also that this would be similarly what happened in the Texas Railroad Commission versus Pullman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.381" offset="10034260">And that here, we have Mr. Patterson who has enjoined the enforcement of the judgment of Justice Warner, saying that the judgment denies him rights under the federal law and state law, and that therefore, the justice lacks jurisdiction to make any judgment in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.743" offset="10143765">And I would assume that this case is very similar to that, and again reiterate that leaves nothing for this Court to decide as regards to what I’m speaking of only to the questions of due process, whether due process was afforded Mr. Patterson in the justice court or whether the appeal bond is constitutional or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.297" offset="10241985">Now to his argument as to whether -- I think the Court may be a little confused now as to what appellant is trying to argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.593" offset="10295171">He is saying this I think basically, I’ll try to simplify some.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.279" offset="10313874">He’s saying that Patterson was denied a fair hearing in the justice court because Warner had a pecuniary interest, and therefore, he didn’t have a fair hearing, so it’s no hearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.617" offset="10375210">So as a result, he has an absolute right to an appeal, and we contend and say that -- we contend that there is no absolute right to appeal and we cite Ortwein versus Schwab and that Ortwein versus Schwab, this Court determined that one did not have an absolute right to appeal from administrative hearing for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.296" offset="10473953">And we say likewise, one does not have an absolute right to appeal from justice court for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.355" offset="10522122">And we could assume that the appeal bond that one pays to appeal from a justice court is very comparable to the fee of $25.00 that one had to pay to appeal from the administrative hearing in Ortwein to a court there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2660.439" offset="10718459">Now if this Court should determine that the JP did in fact have a pecuniary interest, and therefore, he should’ve disqualified himself and that he didn’t -- his judgment is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.086" offset="10781048">And should you further question whether the appeal bond acts as a bar to access to a court of record then I cite the Kras case for the proposition and rule that one does not have an absolute rule to initial judicial determination of one’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.654" offset="10863386">And again, I would compare the appeal bond to that of the $50.00 filing fee that one had to pay in Kras.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.724" offset="10907690">Another argument that the appellant uses is that well, here we have Mr. Patterson who is forced into a JP court and supposedly had a hearing, but yet it wasn’t a fair hearing, so it's no hearing, but to appeal, you’re making the man pay a double bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.752" offset="10995775">Well, if the Court is to believe that argument, then as has been mentioned earlier, any amount, any fee of any amount would stand in the way not only appeal bond, but you’d have to give an absolute right for everyone to appeal, and therefore, it would necessitate the overruling yourselves and Ortwein v. Schwab, and United States v. Kras, and really what you would be doing is extending the rule (Inaudible).</text>
