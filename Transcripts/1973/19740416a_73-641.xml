            <text syncTime="24.936" offset="176483">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.176" offset="193411">This case involves the deficiency in federal income tax for the taxable year 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.537" offset="218906">The issue is whether the petitioner is entitled to a deduction for his distributive share of a net operating loss resulting from research and experimental expenditures incurred and paid by Burns, a partnership during the taxable year 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.004" offset="312738">Petitioner contends he is entitled to deduct his distributive share of the net operating loss of Burns since the expenses giving rise to this loss were incurred and paid during the taxable year 1966 as research and experimental expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.482" offset="402704">These expenses are covered by Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.318" offset="441992">The Commission of Internal Revenue has disallowed these expenses upon audit of the partnership return on the grounds that neither Burns Investment Company nor the Petitioner Snow was engaged in a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.752" offset="515762">The United States Tax Court sustained the Commissioner and the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit sustained the Tax Court's decision holding that the expenditures sought to be deducted by Burns Investment Company in 1966 were pre-operating expenses and not deductible under Section 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.482" offset="614713">The facts of the case were fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.466" offset="626625">In 1963, Mr. Trott who was the inventor of a trash-burning device and who was also the managing partner of Burns Investment Company resigned from his position with the Procter &amp; Gamble Company and purchased an interest in a small, closely-held corporation doing business as Crossbow.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.057" offset="717009">In addition to his activity in Crossbow, Mr. Trott carried on research and development work on three different items: Number one, a telephone answering device; number two, a tape recorder; and number three, the item at issue, a trash burner or a leaf burner.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.257" offset="829753">Upon audit of the partnership return, the Internal Revenue Service held that Mr. Trott, the general partner was engaged in the business of an inventor by virtue of his activities in these various projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.820" offset="920033">The partnerships which were three, which were formed to carry on these various ventures, were doing business as Echo Development Company and that partnership was formed in March of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.870" offset="992235">The second partnership doing business as Courier Enterprises was formed to carry on the development of the tape recorder and that partnership was also formed in March of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.953" offset="1052526">The partnership, Burns Investment Company which was formed to carry on the development of the trash burner was formed in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.934" offset="1104457">All three partnerships was formed for the same purpose, and that was the development, securing patents on and finally either producing or licensing another manufacture to produce these various items.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.611" offset="1187213">During 1966, Echo and Courier -- 1966 is the year at issue and during 1966, Echo and Courier had completed products -- that is the tape recorder, and the telephone answering device which was then held available for sale or licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.884" offset="1288255">Patents had been applied for, in the case of the telephone answering device as of August the 16th, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.154" offset="1325349">Patents had been applied for, in the case of the tape recorder as of November 22, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.400" offset="1362338">Patents for the trash burner was applied for as of June 10, 1968 and in each instance, patents were granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.786" offset="1411866">And in the case of the trash burner, foreign patents have been granted in at least 14 foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.380" offset="1450318">The Internal Revenue Service held that Burns Investment Company was not engaged in a trade or business during the taxable year 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.755" offset="1495771">The Internal Revenue Service did not see fit to disturb the status of Echo or Courier, the two remaining partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.524" offset="1534851">Mr. Trott, the inventor and the managing partner, testified that he worked on the development of the trash burner during the years 1964 and 1965, and during that time, he devoted at least one-third of his time to that venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.200" offset="1613531">On December 10th 1965, the development of the trash burner had advanced to the stage that Mr. Trott had received an opinion from patent counsel, stating that "features of the trash burner were then patentable" in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.966" offset="1680614">However, he advised against filing an application for a patent in December of 1965 suggesting that the filing be held up until a prototype had been built.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.185" offset="1829512">The prototype, to which we allude as existing in 1965, was a rather crude prototype model that admittedly did have some flaws in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.890" offset="1880294">It did not work well.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.937" offset="1888444">The second letter which was received from patent counsel in February of 1966, pointed out that the prototype that was then in existence needed further modification, again in the opinion of patent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.798" offset="1963990">After receiving the letter from patent counsel advising of that fact in 1966, Mr. Trott proceeded to form the partnership Burns Investment Company to raise capital to further develop the trash burner.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.662" offset="2043402">After forming the partnership, articles of partnership were drawn up and filed with the Hamilton County Reporter's Office.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.427" offset="7050449">I think I'd like to refer to the text of the statute just set forth in Appendix A of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.940" offset="7084513">This statute provides that a taxpayer may treat research or experimental expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year in connection with his trade or business as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.624" offset="7163193">Subsection B provides for an election to amortize such expenses over a period of time not less than 16 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.627" offset="7211259">Now, this case focuses upon the statutory requirement which exists in both subsection A and subsection B that the expenditures be incurred in connection with the taxpayer's trade or businesses.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1799.492" offset="7274684">Well, do you mean -- is your view of that that the trade or business will must already be an ongoing business?</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.212" offset="7301642">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.647" offset="7307285">In our view, the term trade or business has had a long and honored history under the Taxing Act as recognized by this Court that the tax law has long drawn the distinction between investment activities or income producing activities and that trade or business connotes something more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.368" offset="7406237">More than the hope of a profit, it connotes holding oneself out as selling -- available to selling goods or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.038" offset="7444898">Now, this case involves only 1966 and the courts below I think properly confined their attention to the events of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.824" offset="7488052">Now, in that year, you had a situation where Trott, the purported inventor had this idea for a product, he needed some financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.287" offset="7537894">He asked several of his friends to lend, to give him some money and ultimately, a limited partnership venture was formed of the petitioner here contributing $10,000.00, I think for 4% limited partnership interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.106" offset="7605185">Now, the important thing in our view is, what exactly happened in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.525" offset="7638831">And I think the findings of that of the Tax Court are not disputed in this regard that what happened simply was that a very crude prototype model was developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.489" offset="7690658">Patent counsel examined it, looked at it and said simply that it wasn't reduced to practice, that it didn't work properly and that additional work would have to be done on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.686" offset="7739455">Ultimately, the partnership spent the rest of its $40,000.00 initial capital I think in the next year 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.536" offset="7774877">And then ultimately, as both courts below adverted to more work had to be done on it that the device radically changed and before the ultimate patent was applied for in 1969 and received in 1970, the device became a very different device.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.281" offset="7925864">What seems to be -- what seems to what can be pieced together essentially is that the partnership went out of existence in 1968 or 1969.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.297" offset="8421982">I think from -- I think that that flows from the services acquiescence in the Best Lock Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.018" offset="8452807">There was a case where the company was clearly in the business of manufacturing locks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.597" offset="8487184">The Tax Court's findings -- the Internal Revenue Service however disallowed to claim the 174 deductions for the development of an isothermal air compressor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.205" offset="8537548">And the Tax Court in its opinion said simply that disallowance ignored that corporation's long history of experimentation and efforts to develop new products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.329" offset="8582060">I think once you have it, an ongoing trade or business, I think it's a statutory manner you have a trade or business in connection with which a research or experimental expenditures would be incurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.239" offset="8673698">Well, apparently, there are instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.737" offset="8687700">There is a case called Mayrath decided by the Fifth Circuit which involved the situation of a man who developed, who invented farm implements and then he spent a lot of money on an experimental home and the service disallowed that deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.820" offset="8763977">There was very little in the way of focusing on the question as to whether -- he was clearly an inventor having invented and manufactured, you know and sold farm products but the Fifth Circuit simply said that this was an experimental home in which he was living and then they will classify simply as personal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.619" offset="8843180">I think that the service probably would like to reserve some leeway so to speak if the products are totally unrelated to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.566" offset="8898978">But because the Best Universal Lock Company case rested in part, I think on the corporation's long history of experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.715" offset="8935654">But I think that it's a general matter, the acquiescence in that case, I think stands for the proposition that if you have an ongoing business, which was clearly not the case here in 1966, that research or experimental expenditures expended to develop a new product would come within 174 treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2967.510" offset="11946736">Resuming the Government's presentation of the Snow case, I think the best way to describe how the statute works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.502" offset="11978710">Section 174 of the Code is to simply suggest to the Court that there are two types of capital expenditures that could occur in any particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.630" offset="12031269">Now, there's the capital expenditure that is incurred before one enters trade or business and then capital expenditures which are incurred after the commencement of a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.631" offset="12087275">Now, in our view, Section 174 is only designed to cover this second category of capital expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.905" offset="12124369">It makes them subject to the option to either currently deduct or to amortize over five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.645" offset="12167314">Thus, the insertion, in our view of the term "trade or business" in the statute requires that the research or experimental expenditures be incurred by an ongoing business in order to come within the purview of the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.480" offset="12250697">Petitioner's references in the legislative history to the fact that Congressman referred to the fact that small businesses that the statute was designed to benefit small businesses, I think it should be emphasized to the extent that those remarks have relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.214" offset="12337633">The important thing is that it was still a business that was designed to be benefited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.830" offset="12360098">That trade or business is a technical term under the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.697" offset="12375562">It appears in many provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.651" offset="12383399">It's been interpreted by the Courts to require the holding of one's self out as engaged in selling goods or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.089" offset="12413074">And if Congress wanted to simply make all research or experimental expenditures deductible without regard to the context in which they were incurred, I think it could've easily employ the standard it used in 1942 when Section 212 came into the Code, that is expenditures incurred in connection with the production of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.336" offset="12510041">The fact that it didn't do that and the fact that Congress created this special type of non-trade or business expenditures but yet, nevertheless used the term "trade or business" in Section 174 is to us dispositive of the matter in terms of requiring that a strict standard be employed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.210" offset="12597603">And I think that the standard is important because the trade or business test provides in our view an objective criteria with which to measure, to separate out, so to speak, simple, personal activities that is someone tinkering in his basement with something that he thinks someday may amount to something and spending money on that, so to think.</text>

            <text syncTime="3771.286" offset="15161887">In 1951, Representative Kent indicated that the American Bar Association had urged Section 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.065" offset="15221029">I would also like to point out that I believe the issue has really boiled down to whether or not the petitioner Snow was in a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.339" offset="15270139">That is whether or not there was a trade or business in existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3815.174" offset="15337430">The regulations under that Section defines existence of a trade or business versus the beginning of a trade or business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3828.260" offset="15389780">And it has to do with the amortization of organization expenditures which is a type of expenditures that is very much akin to a Section 174 type of expenditure -- that is pre-operating type expenditure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3909.154" offset="15713384">Mr. Trott devoted one-third of his time to this venture and he commenced devoting his time way back in 1964 not in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.359" offset="15758211">This was a continuous activity through this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.975" offset="15776601">It was not a sporadic venture that just popped up in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.613" offset="15803246">It was a bonafide business venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.485" offset="15814740">This man gave up a very good position and devoted his entire energies and efforts to the development of these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.584" offset="15859043">It was certainly no play thing and it was a continuing endeavor on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.887" offset="15888300">And this is the kind of thing that Congress chose to encourage by implementing into law, Section 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.319" offset="15938038">I am not sure that we're clear on one further point and that is amortization versus deductibility of expenses under Section 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.757" offset="15991745">That I submit is a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.770" offset="15999791">If he can amortize these expenses, he can deduct these expenses under Section 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.288" offset="16025913">The only remedy available to my client if it is held at Burns Investment Company is not engaged in a trade or business, is a capitalization of these expenditures without any depreciation available to him.</text>
