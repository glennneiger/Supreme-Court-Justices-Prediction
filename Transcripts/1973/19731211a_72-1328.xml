            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="43.066" offset="248999">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.281" offset="261851">This case is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, suppressing certain telephone conversations which were recorded during the course of a Court authorized wire interception of respondents’ telephone pursuit to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.873" offset="360281">After a thorough investigation, the results of which are detailed in an affidavit that was submitted in support of the wire interception application and that’s set forth at pages 9 through 20 of the appendix, federal law enforcement agencies developed probable cause to believe that Irving Kahn and an associate, one Jacobs were involved in conducting illegal gambling enterprises in violation of Illinois and a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.055" offset="468950">This information included detail statements of three reliable informants which were checked and verified in various ways, including examinations of telephone records.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.995" offset="516702">Since it was concluded that sufficient evidence to prove the offense and to illuminate its full nature and extent, including the identity of any confederates, could not be procured by conventional investigative techniques, an application was made to Judge Campbell of the District Court from the Northern District of Illinois, for an order authorizing interception of wire communications on the Kahn and Jacobs’ home telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.350" offset="626103">This order was issued by Judge Campbell on March 20, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.003" offset="644807">In the order, he made the following findings, this is at page 21 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.514" offset="666854">He found first that there is probable cause to believe that Irving Kahn, Jake Jacobs, and others as yet unknown have committed and are committing offenses involving the use of interstate telephone communication facilities to the transmission of bets and betting offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.472" offset="734668">He secondly found that there was probable cause to believe that particular wire communications of Irving Kahn, Jake Jacobs, and unknown others concerning these offenses will be obtained through the interception authorization for which is applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.437" offset="798511">He found that normal investigative procedures reasonably appeared unlikely to succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.968" offset="820663">Finally, he found that there was probable cause to believe that the telephones in the Kahn household have been and are being used by Irving Kahn and others as yet unknown in connection with the commission of the above described offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.056" offset="884924">Therefore, he issued an order which authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation to intercept wire communications of Irving Kahn and others as yet unknown concerning the above described offenses to and from the Kahn household telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.733" offset="955664">Now, he provided that such interception would not automatically terminate with the first conversation that was intercepted, but that it shall continue and this is on page 23 of the appendix, until communications are intercepted which revealed the manner in which Irving Kahn, Jake Jacobs and others as yet unknown participate in the illegal use of interstate telephone facilities for the transmission of bets and betting information in an aid of racketeering enterprise, and which revealed the identities of there confederates, their places of operation and the nature of the conspiracy involved therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.721" offset="1103621">Judge Campbell authorized this interception to continue for a period of 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.980" offset="1132669">He directed as a statute requires that efforts be made to minimize the interception of conversations not relating to the offenses under investigation and he provided for five-day status reports by the attorney applying for the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.210" offset="1197558">Now, pursuant to this authorization, conversations over the Kahn household telephones were intercepted for five days beginning on the evening of March 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.498" offset="1234756">The results are spelled out in the interim status report at page 26 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.476" offset="1262655">They included on Saturday, March 21st, the first full day of the interception 50 telephone calls approximately involving the placing of bets amounting to about $15,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.490" offset="1318661">They involved conversations between Irving Kahn in Arizona and Minnie Kahn at the Kahn home in Chicago in which gambling activities and losses where discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.959" offset="1376549">These conversations provided the interstate component of the charge under 18 U.S.C. 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.584" offset="1407060">They involved also in that the same day, conversations between Mrs. Kahn and unknown gambling figures advising of the number of bets placed the amounts of these bets, the identities of the betters.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.483" offset="1990635">Now, when Mr. Kahn returned from Arizona to Chicago on Monday, he had further conversations with known gambling figures regarding the results of the weekend's wagering activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.118" offset="2045179">In view of the success of the interception and achieving the purposes for which it was sought, it was discontinued after five days rather than to continuing for the 15 days for which Judge Campbell had authorized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.285" offset="2089900">With the evidence thus, procured Irving and Minnie Kahn were both indicted for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.366" offset="2122188">They moved to suppress the evidence procured by the wire interception and the District Court granted the suppression motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.496" offset="2150713">First of all, as to conversations between Irving and Minnie on marital privilege grounds; secondly, as to all conversations of Minnie because the interception was not authorized by Judge Campbell’s order in the view of the District Court; thirdly, as to all conversations in which Irving did not participate on the same grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.680" offset="2231484">On the Government’s appeal, the Court of Appeals reverse on the marital privilege holding but it affirmed the suppression of all conversations of Minnie Kahn on the ground that she was not a person unknown within the meaning of Judge Campbell’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.821" offset="2291984">In so doing the Court construed the statutory requirement for identification of a person if known in the application and in the order to require the naming of any known user of the phone whose complicity in the offense might have been discoverable by careful investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.891" offset="2360320">It found that the Government had not prove that Minnie Kahn was not such a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.147" offset="2381322">This evidentiary finding by the Court of Appeals was made without any record having been developed on the subject and indeed I suggest that the affidavit of the FBI agent, at top page 11 of the appendix, indicates that the belief of the investigating officials at the time was that if Irving Kahn was not there, the bets would be routed through Jake Jacobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.898" offset="2488320">So, there are some question about the correctness of the Court of Appeals conclusion on this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.498" offset="2514756">The Court of Appeals also construed Judge Campbell’s order to authorize only the interception of conversations of the Irving Kahn, in other words, he had to participate in all the conversations and the other party had to be a person unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.634" offset="2575256">It considered this construction of the statute in order to comport with a policy of protecting individual privacy and to avoid making interception authorizations a virtual general warrant as it put it, Judge Stevens dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.827" offset="2640039">Now, we submit the Minnie Kahn was a person unknown within the meaning of both the statute and the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.259" offset="2669819">And that the interception of her conversations regarding the illegal gambling enterprise was lawful and proper and produced evidence fully usable in the criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.116" offset="2717257">In order to remove any possible confusion, I’d like to begin by indicating what this case does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.382" offset="2742230">It does not involve the general facial constitutionality of Title III, the wire interception provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.796" offset="2779951">These by the way have been uniformly upheld by the lower courts were challenged with the exception of one subsequently reversed District Court’s opinion in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.472" offset="2822687">Secondly, it does not involve any finding that the Government in fact knew that Minnie Kahn was involved in the illegal enterprise and that she was in fact a target of this Government investigation, but the Government failed to name her in the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.613" offset="2879216">No such finding was involved.</text>
