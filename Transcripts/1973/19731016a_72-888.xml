            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments first this morning in number 72-888, Zahn against the International Paper Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.298" offset="117969">Mr. Langrock, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter F. Langrock</label>
            <text syncTime="13.343" offset="130090">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.575" offset="143047">This is an action that was initiated in the United States District Court, from the District of Vermont on behalf of the Zahns and the leaser and other personnel similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.590" offset="183066">It was brought against International Paper Company and the facts of the matter alleged certain problems with the pollution of Lake Champlain as affecting the plaintiffs and the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.754" offset="231758">The particular mill about in Ticonderoga is also the subject of another matter before this Court, which has been referred to a Master in Chancery.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.009" offset="272823">The District judge on a motion to dismiss the class action aspects of the case took the matter under advisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.881" offset="304274">He appeared before him and after a period of time, he dismissed the class action aspects of the case with and I quote from his opinion “great reluctance”.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.666" offset="347429">The matter was then appealed to the Second Circuit of Court of Appeals, an interlocutory appeal, permission being granted by the Circuit as well as asked for by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.475" offset="390687">There they have divided opinion, it was affirmed the en banc proceedings was rather complicated with four of the active judges of seven boarding for en banc, but failing to en banc because of a failure to achieve the majority of five, and, certiorari was granted to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.253" offset="465711">The basic issue presented is rather a narrow one, and that is whether a United States District Court judge is prohibited from taking jurisdiction of a class action where one on one members of the class might not reach the jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.991" offset="540735">In looking at the rule, this is a 23 (b) (3) proceeding and the rule initially requires before any Court can take jurisdiction of the class, a finding that the class is superior to other available methods to the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.098" offset="629133">The first proposition that I put to the Court is that one can really reduce this case to a mathematical formula, that if we assume that a case on all effects can be efficient, in the Court when it isn’t sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.452" offset="698514">We then, if it is not efficient, the Court is prohibited the District Court from taking jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.017" offset="720771">If it is efficient then we have two choices, either the Court may take jurisdiction as a class or it is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.724" offset="755670">Under this ruling it is prohibited from taking jurisdiction, and so --</text>

            <text syncTime="177.243" offset="785763">Levit is ruling Mr. Langrock.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.982" offset="796630">He simply held that in his view of the law, that each of the plaintiffs having to have $10,000 as a matter in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.343" offset="838113">It was not efficient to maintain it as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.642" offset="855353">I didn’t get the feeling in from his ruling that he felt that he was absolutely debarred, had he reached another result as to the practicality thing in view of his view of the law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter F. Langrock</label>
            <text syncTime="204.109" offset="893179">I have to disagree with that, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.539" offset="898926">The opinion I think states quite clearly that it was dismissed solely on the prohibitation of Snyder versus Harris, and that it was dismissed with great reluctance, and that is his words.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="216.493" stopTime="236.521">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="216.493" offset="942707">Yes, but interpreting Snyder against Harris as he did, he then went on to conclude that there would be such serious complications in delay in determining who was bound and who wasn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.368" offset="1010207">That this was not maintainable as a class action.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Peter F. Langrock</label>
            <text syncTime="236.521" offset="1022851">Assuming that only members of the class had reached the jurisdictional amount, in other words, if you define your class at 10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.717" offset="1051585">Then, he would say, that would be impossible, and therefore, he refused to redefine the class excluding members who would have less in the jurisdictional amount of the 10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.378" offset="1094217">The question that -- the policy question here, I think, in so much before the Court and in class actions is the question of judicial efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.489" offset="1138730">I would promote that this type of class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.737" offset="1147716">Now, this is not a -- I consider unmanageable class action, this is not a manufactured one.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.979" offset="1172689">This is a real controversy involving approximately 240 owners of the lake on the lake shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.752" offset="1195781">This is a case which is going forward in the Federal District Court where there’s a class action or individually on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.942" offset="1224516">The question of multiple litigation that made arise, if the class action were not allowed, maybe very extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.729" offset="1255654">It may be done several State Courts, in other District Courts, it may well be multiple litigation in the same District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.258" offset="1285747">We think that the judicial efficiency of this type of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.172" offset="1301420">This is the -- a proper place for a class action, he was whether -- is re-litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.790" offset="1323886">Litigation was already -- the facts that have already been involved in the Supreme Court matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.147" offset="1341336">This matter is not going to go away, and we think the District Court should be allowed to make a finding that this is the superior, most efficient way of handling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.784" offset="1383863">And, if that is not the case, then he is prohibited under the Rule 23 of taking it at any case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="331.420" offset="1402462">When you say make a finding to that effect, do you mean that he should be able to include in the class, people who do not themselves have $10,000 in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.908" offset="1444362">Isn’t the case of Clark versus Paul Gray that was cited in Snyder, and that was cited in Second Circuit opinion, that 306 U.S case.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.555" offset="1482919">Wouldn’t we have to overrule that to go a long way?</text>

            <text syncTime="355.383" offset="1498279">That case goes back prior to be change of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.221" offset="1513639">That was an action where some of the named plaintiffs, did not meet the jurisdictional amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.574" offset="1547076">There was on the face of the record, certain aspects of the case which are not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.312" offset="1578005">In other words, there were people who did not meet the jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.324" offset="1590021">And the effect -- looking at the change of the rule, one of the problems, one of the reason for the change of the rule was that it was an awkward situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.472" offset="1630668">We’re talking about spurious, or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.023" offset="1640803">And the rule simply states what test should be, empirical test to meet the class action with a lot of safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.256" offset="1669747">And we do not think that the previous reasoning of Clark versus Gray calls for overruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.211" offset="1685629">Perhaps --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="402.920" stopTime="424.568">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="402.920" offset="1688451">But if you follow the reasoning of Snyder against Harris, the rules could be amended to one as blow in the face and you’re still subject to the jurisdictional limitations of the statute, and all the Court was interpreting in Clark versus Paul Gray was the statute that the fact of the class action rule may have been driven and certainly doesn’t affect their reasoning as I read it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_f_langrock" startTime="424.568" stopTime="483.905">
            <label>Mr. Peter F. Langrock</label>
            <text syncTime="424.568" offset="1774968">Well, I again would beg -- it seems to me that what we had in the statute is the diversity of jurisdiction, diversity of citizenship plus the jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.051" offset="1828989">There have been times in this Court when matter is not meeting the jurisdictional amount, when matter is not needing the diversity of requirement had been allowed when attached to a case with this proper jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.020" offset="1872875">The whole concept to the ancillary pendent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.330" offset="1894087">It seems to me that it is a clearly set forth doctrine, that absolute diversity is not required when the main case has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.985" offset="1940689">And to me, it’s not logical to say that one can proceed when you don’t have complete diversity, which is one requirement of the statute but you must meet the jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.091" offset="1981127">And, this is even more so because the diversity requirement is really a constitutional doctrine where the amount in controversy is a statutory one.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="483.905" offset="2012369">But, nonetheless, the Court in Clark did say that and that was after the decision in Ben-Hur which had ruled the way you indicated on diversity.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.062" offset="2072973">I think Clark misconstrued its previous precedence, and it’s really a dictum in Clark, the peculiar situation in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.217" offset="2109649">I don’t think Clark needs to be overruled to reach our result.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.642" offset="2171298">And, I don’t think that the concept of ancillary pendent jurisdiction is prohibited by Clark.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.749" offset="3263739">We think that is still the good law that it is not necessary to have complete diversity where the case and controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.877" offset="3320268">We fail to see how the diversity requirement should be differently treated than the amounting controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.038" offset="3364885">The effect of this case if it is not -- I should point out one more thing too and that is there is big body of case law which in the question of intervention is a matter of right under 2482, indicates that there’s not a need for independent jurisdictional amount where the first case has.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.885" offset="3444297">And, I would suggest that this Court -- the problems would come about if this Court does not recognize that where in the efficient cause of the administration of justice, you got have this finding first, that a Court is prohibited from taking jurisdiction over a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.498" offset="3506782">Not only does it destroy the class action concept wherever there is a federal question requiring an amount in controversy, or a diversity question involving the amount in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.365" offset="3550250">But it has effects on the question of the development of the concept of pendent or ancillary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.467" offset="3578567">It has the effect on the law involving intervention of right, and I don’t see how logically one can say that can take jurisdiction on cases which don’t need jurisdictional requirements ancillary in certain cases and not on others.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.217" offset="3641574">What I’m arguing here for is not an expansion of any law as I see it but merely an application of law to those cases where we can efficiently put this in to the hands of the District Judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.303" offset="4377913">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.126" offset="4397244">I’d like to divide my argument as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.248" offset="4409783">I’d like to make a few comments about Mr. Langrock’s statements, some of the questions that were asked, and then I want to address myself to the principle question which it seems to me, plaintiff counsel argument didn’t address itself to directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.024" offset="4476865">And that is this, although the plaintiff stressed the environmental aspects of this case, the legal question presented by this case consents the jurisdiction of the Federal District Courts which have been limited since the beginning of this country in their jurisdiction was so designed by Congress and have been so construed, and limited by the Constitution in Congress in 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.656" offset="4583340">Indeed, the first bill introduced it the Senate of this country ended up as Judiciary Act of 1789, with a jurisdiction limit to $500, and I submit we must never forget, in this case or elsewhere that the Federal Court system is a system for a limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.661" offset="4655438">In every demand like this made on the Federal Courts has to be carefully examined by lawyers, by the Courts, by Congress, and the public to see whether it’s consistent with the ever mounting federal case law which engulfs the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.692" offset="4719491">I would like to address myself first to the reasons why the Court of Appeals is correct in holding that the District Court did not have jurisdiction over this class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.862" offset="4764212">I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist put his finger on the cardinal of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.153" offset="4781349">Sir, when you said that in order to overrule the opinion of the Court of Appeals below and the opinion of Judge Leddy, this Court must confront Clark against Gray and overrule it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.855" offset="4832131">I think that’s clear and I think that’s particularly so because of the interpretation put upon Clark against Gray and whether you decide that this plaintiff’s counsel said before the Federal Rule 23 was amended in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.863" offset="4884167">But the interpretation put upon Clark against Gray and Snyder against Harris was thereafter Rule 23 was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.399" offset="4918335">I also like to talk about ancillary jurisdiction and the reasons why ancillary or pendent jurisdiction superficially in appealing idea here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.096" offset="4957100">And in my judgment, badly misinterpreted by the dissenting judge below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.786" offset="4975909">The reasons why an ancillary or pendent jurisdiction if applied to a spurious class action where the separate and distinct claims not a unitary constitutional case or controversy, separate claims and people who fall short of the jurisdictional requirement would contravene constitutional statutory, decisional and policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.969" offset="5072666">Now, I covered comments statements by the plaintiff’s counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.806" offset="5087922">He said, as I understood him that the so called sludge bed still shows that the effects of pollution are very much in the effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.250" offset="5137763">This is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.793" offset="5147899">In the case brought by State from Moore against New York and (Inaudible) which is now on trial before a special master (Inaudible) we have a record of 14,000 pages, we have hundreds of exhibits, thousands of pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.930" offset="5204428">And in that case, I have cross-examined witnesses who have said -- one of them who spend his life from the river and sails over the waters of the sludge bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.749" offset="5235775">I asked him, what is the water like?</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.467" offset="5314664">Now, let us look at the basis for the jurisdiction, federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.297" offset="5353953">I think it is fair to keep claiming that from the beginning of time, Congress has had the task of describing limitations on this diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.285" offset="5393868">Congress has repeatedly reenacted the phrase matter in dispute, originally in 1789, a matter in controversy as it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.059" offset="5428976">The Courts have held that this phrase must be strictly construed, the policy of the Statute calls for its strict construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.593" offset="5479131">And that cases was smaller amount for the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.195" offset="5493551">Indeed the diversity statute 1332A constitutes as the Court said in Heely and represents a demonstration of a delicate balance between Federal and State powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.094" offset="5545169">The Federal Court should not be looked upon as a reservoir for all litigation, but rather in diversity cases, only those cases which meet the jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.331" offset="5586024">And, the jurisdictional amount towards this Court knows as applies in cases arising under the laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.727" offset="5655615">It rejected aggregation, despite the claims of the plaintiffs and the sentence in that case that this reduction of aggregation would undercut and undermined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.873" offset="5728235">The Court pointed out that a spurious class action is a kind of a permissive joinder device of separate and distinct claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.928" offset="5764493">And in that situation, each plaintiff to where it’s separate and distinct claim must meet the jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.358" offset="5794168">They pointed out that the non-aggregation doctrine was not based on old Rule 23 or any rule or procedure, rather it is based under Court’s consistent interpretation of the phrase matter and controversy, which predates even the Federal Rules of Procedure Amendments in 1938, that the Court has held its consistent interpretation for years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.514" offset="7566838">And in Snyder, the Court pointed out that a class action is kind of admissive joinder device where the particular scope is not directed at a risk or a corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.710" offset="8819566">The second is that you would have two sets of laws available to private parties, both of which would govern, where a State is a party, and also the Vermont law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.851" offset="9564160">Now, even if the power to hear exists here with respect to pendent jurisdictions still the Court pointed out in Moor, that that doctrine, the pendent jurisdiction involves consideration for judicial economy, inconvenience, and fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.730" offset="9639706">And I submit to you that sweeping in these 200 people with 200 separate and distinct claims runs a 180 degrees away from consideration to judicial economy and fairness of convenience.</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.382" offset="9782230">There’s no jurisdictional bar with respect to Vermont class action statute because according to my reading of Vermont law, the County Courts have cases involving $200 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.523" offset="9826847">So, this isn’t the case, for the unnamed plaintiffs are going to be debarred from suing in an appropriate forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="2487.670" offset="10027468">And even if the text writers who are in favor of class actions have come down on that for the same reason and the reasons are just those I mentioned that each and everyone of these plaintiffs is going to have to present a set of different facts of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.587" offset="10991073">If I read the mandate of 23 (b) (3) right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.228" offset="11005701">The only time that this could be done is when it is efficient and the only time when the Court could do so is when it is going to save judicial time across the aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.032" offset="11040914">And, I think -- this “parade of horribles” which was suggested by Mr. Whipple, I think aren’t true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.595" offset="11063171">Let us go back to the District Court, I don’t want to argue here, we’re going have a mass trial of 240 people or the merits of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.273" offset="11089816">But I’ll say, let the District Court judge, look at this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.197" offset="11101518">Let them sit by on the issue, and make a decision, how am I going to handle this problem involving a serious number of people who are affected in a peculiar way by acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.831" offset="11160033">I don’t think so, Your Honor, he indicated that it could not be managed if he had to separate out those who had $10,000 and those who didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.759" offset="11187827">You got to have to try the damages before you could get to the defendant class, but his opinion said with great reluctance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.539" offset="11214890">He dismissed the suit, because of the holdings of Snyder versus Harris, and so I think we should really leave that decision in the hands of the judge who is going to have to make that decision on the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.479" offset="11250625">You have to leave that one way or another, and, if we lose there, I think that takes care of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.203" offset="11269538">I apologize to the Court, I not recognize a name of Illinois versus Milwaukee, that case was decided after we brought this and I am familiar with the case but I’m not quite sure as Mr. Whipple knows exactly what the effects of the common law of the federal common law environmental matters on water waste, how this would affect it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.767" offset="11351771">In any case, I think we still would be involved in the $10,000 jurisdictional amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.818" offset="11484056">Well, I take it that you really marked this down that the characterization of the very question as an issue of Federal law, you concede does not assist you much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.092" offset="11529091">Not very much, I think we should all hit the $10,000, the question is to where.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.824" offset="11552078">These are other efficiencies, which tie into this type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.305" offset="11569946">The efficiency is an expert time -- the efficiency’s all the way along the line in this whole environmental field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.570" offset="11591053">But I don’t think I want to get in to that but the statement that this sounds in nuisance and trespass are only two of the three areas which it sounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.212" offset="11633580">It also sounds in the property rights, riparian rights of joining owners on a lake, or of not at this really, joining but owners in the same body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.295" offset="11673913">And we think that if ever there was a common nucleus of fact, this is it, International Paper Company, we allege has done one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.998" offset="11708709">And it has continuously done this thing and this affects a large number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.784" offset="11723860">The only difference here would be the question of damages and that can be handled we suggest in a multitude of worries including the possibility of the mass sorting amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.336" offset="11762103">And we don't see the powers of the mass trial, I can say on the either side that to have 240 trials on the issue of the merits frightens me a great deal more than to have some procedure in dealing with damages on a common set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.472" offset="11846635">The comment was made that Snyder has nothing for -- Snyder, the ancillary jurisdiction did not come into Snyder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.339" offset="11882057">I would suggest to the Court that in Snyder, there was no jurisdiction of the Court to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.269" offset="11905776">That was not a case that was going forward and there was nothing for ancillary to hang its -- hang on to tie into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.116" offset="11937228">And I would not have been gone forward in the Courts because of the fact that there was not independent jurisdiction as there is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.571" offset="11971082">And I might suggest to the Court that we may very well have a class here or there maybe other classes where we have a 50 or 200, 250 with only one or two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.623" offset="12015282">And to prohibit the District Judge as a jurisdictional matter from going forward is not promoting efficiency as suggested by my opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.855" offset="12052167">But it is the time in the Court’s hands for using it in a proper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.952" offset="12068571">I am not suggesting for a moment that this matter should be handled as a class action unless it meets the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.585" offset="12099082">And that text is that it is superior to other matters, other ways of handling this as an efficient way in the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.273" offset="12137848">The very Rule of 23 (b) (3) itself, if it doesn’t meet that, we’re out, and if we do meet that, I would hate to see the District Court judge forced at a jurisdictional question to make it a less efficient approach.</text>
