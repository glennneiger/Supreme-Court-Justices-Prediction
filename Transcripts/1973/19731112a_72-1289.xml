            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments first this morning in Number 72-1289, National Railroad Passenger Corporation and others against National Association of Railroad Passengers.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="16.677" offset="143464">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.084" offset="157048">I’m Barrett Prettyman and I represent the petitioners in this case which is hereon certiorari from the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.815" offset="196023">The case presents rather a narrow question, namely, which parties can sue for alleged violations of the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, the Amtrak Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.755" offset="243775">We claim, petitioner’s claim that under the statutory language and pursuant to the Congressional intent, only the Attorney General and where a labor agreement is involved, employees and their representatives can sue for these alleged violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.834" offset="316082">Respondent which is an association of railroad passengers, claims that anyone who is injured and aggrieved by an alleged violation of the Act can bring suit to Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.744" offset="363729">That really is the only issue before the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.295" offset="381910">Before I go into the facts of the immediate case, I’d like to give you just a brief background of the Act itself because it bears on the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.379" offset="414302">This Act was passed because of a genuine concern on behalf of the Congress and the people that all intercity passenger traffic in this country was going to disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.978" offset="464666">In 1929, there were 20,000 passenger trains in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.212" offset="485564">And by 1970, there were only 360.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.368" offset="502178">The plain, hard, cold fact of the matter is that the passengers in this country simply could not pay the high cost of operating this train.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.853" offset="540212">At the same time, Congress in passing the Act did not intend to stop all discontinuances of trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.266" offset="573858">Quite to the contrary, it recognized that some additional paring was in order if any rail passenger traffic was going to be preserved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="133.070" stopTime="136.986">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="133.070" offset="609071">That’s P-A-R-I-N-G or P-A-I-R, paring?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_barrett_prettyman_jr" startTime="136.986" stopTime="139.262">
            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="136.986" offset="624744">P-A-R sir. P-A-R-I-N-G, paring.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="139.262" stopTime="140.663">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="139.262" offset="633835">Paring.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_barrett_prettyman_jr" startTime="140.663" stopTime="755.578">
            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="140.663" offset="639373">Some additional cutting down, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.508" offset="650762">Therefore Congress devised a rather elaborate plan, purpose of which was instead of the individual railroads hereafter deciding which train and when it was going to submit the ICC for paring down, instead the Secretary of Transportation would construct a basic system of passenger service.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.658" offset="739370">The minimum system that the country should have and that would consist therefore of all essential service which hopefully would be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.401" offset="782315">And a corporation was formed, Amtrak, which was given power to enter into contracts with various -- to railroads and take over their passenger service to be funded by government funds, tickets, and the railroads themselves paying entry fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.778" offset="855876">The corporation, Amtrak would operate this basic system and would either operate or discontinue the excess service above the basic system.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.534" offset="894851">I’d like to emphasize again now that the purpose of the Act was not to preserve all passenger service but rather in the words of the House Report to effect a rational reduction of present service in order to save any passenger service.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.833" offset="964127">When the Act became effective, the Secretary of Transportation did designate the basic system, a 21-city pairs (P-A-I-R) with 42 trains running daily as part of the basic system as it developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.489" offset="1026717">When Amtrak took over passenger service, it actually operated originally some 180-passenger trains and today that’s up to a 198.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.729" offset="1067677">The Central of Georgia’s only remaining passenger trains just prior to the passage of this Act were the Nancy Hanks between Savannah and Atlanta and Trains 13 and 14 between Albany, Georgia and Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.548" offset="1126922">And these trains were not part of the basic system.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.201" offset="1141551">Consequently, notice was given of their discontinuance and on April 1, 1971 when the Act did become effective, those trains were discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.518" offset="1174779">However, prior to that the respondent here brought a suit in the Federal District Court against Amtrak, the Central of Georgia and the Southern Railway seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the discontinuance of these three trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.779" offset="1251892">It was alleged that the Act was violated because of the relationship between Central and Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.707" offset="1275611">Southern down and virtually all of the stock of Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.612" offset="1287210">Southern itself had decided not to enter into contract with Amtrak.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.486" offset="1306645">But the Central of Georgia had and they claimed north, the railroad association here claimed that either the entire railway system had to enter into a contract or no part of it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.259" offset="1361816">No subsidiary could.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.217" offset="1373623">And it sought a permanent injunction restraining the parties from enforcing any contract which did not include the entire Southern system.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.271" offset="1405806">The District Court denied the temporary restraining order and dismissed the complaint on the theory that NARP had no standing because of Section 307 which provides that if Amtrak or any railroad violates the Act, the District Court shall have jurisdiction upon petition of the Attorney General of the United States or in the case involved in the labor agreement upon petition of any employee affected thereby including duly authorized employee representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.685" offset="1535478">And the District Courts were given jurisdiction to grant equitable release upon petition of those parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.619" offset="1567242">Now it’s clear that the Court of Appeals reversed and held that there was standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.158" offset="1589394">That's clear that Congress has the authority to limit the right to sue under an Act of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.497" offset="1614785">This Court has so held in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.521" offset="1626802">So the only question here really is whether Congress intended to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.431" offset="1646446">Did it intend to restrict the right to sue?</text>
            <text syncTime="395.665" offset="1659402">We think very clearly it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.144" offset="1669329">We just take the statutory language standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.916" offset="1684376">We’ll note that it doesn’t provide specifically that anyone aggrieved or injured can sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.174" offset="1709453">It does not even provide that the specified remedies in the statute are in addition to other remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.312" offset="1741949">It doesn’t even provide that the specified remedies didn’t extinguish any remedy or right of action not in consistent herewith which it has done in other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.354" offset="1786149">And instead, specifically names the persons who are going to be able to petition the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.426" offset="1810495">In this case however, we do not have to rely upon the words of the statute alone because there are some very specific and direct legislative history that goes right to the point before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.654" offset="1863367">In the original draft of the bill, the District Court was given jurisdiction to sue Amtrak, Amtrak alone -- given jurisdiction when there is a suit against Amtrak alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.331" offset="1918119">Upon petition of the Attorney General or in the case involved in a labor agreement upon petition of any individual affected thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.648" offset="1951347">Now, you’ll note two things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.044" offset="1960960">First of all, Amtrak alone could be sued and secondly, it didn’t say anything about labor representatives just the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.475" offset="1986664">At the hearings which ensue labor representatives came along with ten proposed amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.918" offset="2020415">One of them would have specifically allowed any aggrieved party to bring a suit for violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.433" offset="2050508">As labor spokesman said as the Bill now reads, only the Attorney General except in cases involving a labor agreement could bring actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.372" offset="2094184">Now the Secretary of Transportation who had a good deal to do with this Act in including -- following up on various sections of it, thereupon wrote the committee a letter addressing himself to the various proposed amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.659" offset="2159386">And he said, I would oppose -- I would be opposed to permitting any person to seek enforcement of Section 307.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.504" offset="2198779">Now thereupon what happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="533.169" offset="2209437">This is important because this is not a case oPassengers. f legislative history where we have the committee ignoring people who have submitted views on the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.534" offset="2246844">The committee actually did make specific changes in the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.205" offset="2265548">For example, according to following labor’s wish which the Secretary had no objection to; they added specifically that representatives of employees could sue as well as the employees themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.882" offset="2320300">Again, following labor’s wish and the secretary thought it was unnecessary but it didn’t oppose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.583" offset="2347050">They introduced the allowing other railroads to be sued as well as Amtrak.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.817" offset="2368052">In other words, not just Amtrak alone but other railroads could also be sued under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.110" offset="2389159">But because of the Secretary’s objection, the committee specifically refused to introduce this concept of permitting all aggrieved persons to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.895" offset="2440359">The Secretary had objected to it and the committee left it out and the Bill was passed without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.967" offset="2464601">It seems perfectly clear to us from this that Congress intended only those parties that were designated in the Bill in the statute to be able to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.302" offset="2502008">This case therefore becomes like Switchmen’s Union and Montana-Dakota Utilities and Fleischmann Distilling, and Calhoon versus Harvey and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.033" offset="2540878">The cases where the specific remedies which were mentioned excluded others including suits by aggrieved parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.296" offset="2581943">In addition however, there are very important policy reasons why Congress left out aggrieved parties and why this Court should not sanction it.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.344" offset="2626142">The Secretary of Transportation, the ICC and Amtrak, all were given very unusual authority and responsibility to fashion a workable passenger transportation system in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.299" offset="2673894">For example, this Amtrak is supposed to make a profit eventually even though it was recognized that these various railroads were losing millions on their passenger traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.281" offset="2709838">So it is a very complex and difficult job that was fashioned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.533" offset="2726870">And if anybody can sue the railroad, certain things are clearly going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.497" offset="2746723">For example, even if there’s a single suit in regard to the discontinuance of an important line, you are going to have delays if temporary restraining orders are entered which as our brief shows could cost literally millions to Amtrak.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.335" offset="2810044">But even more importantly, if more than one person sues, if suits are brought in regard to a single discontinuance in Alabama and then Georgia, etcetera, you’re going to have the possibility of not only the temporary delays of one case but you’re going to have possibilities of conflict between circuits which are going to unduly delay the discontinuances that are clearly called for by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.396" offset="2922371">This case therefore becomes similar to Halloway versus Brist-Myers which is cited to the Court in our reply brief which interestingly was decided by -- also by the D.C. Circuit but by a completely different panel from the panel that decided the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.529" offset="2990916">And they decided that the private party even though aggrieved does not have a right to sue under the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.661" offset="3015367">And the Court specifically pointed out the vexatious litigation that could ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.050" offset="3044937">It pointed out to private parties may institute piecemeal lawsuits reflecting disparate concerns and not a coordinated enforcement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.350" offset="3086106">That same principle is precisely applicable here.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="764.752" offset="3135739">It was filed about a week ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.345" offset="3150158">Finally, to allow brief persons to sue here simply makes no sense if you look at the overall plan of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.782" offset="3183909">Right now, no discontinuances of the basic system are allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.561" offset="3207001">They won’t be allowed until July 1 of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.106" offset="3225182">After July 1 of 1974, the Railroad Amtrak if it wants to discontinue a basic service train it has to give 30 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.280" offset="3265829">Thereupon, the Interstate Commerce Commission, if it decides not to investigate under Section 13 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act that is the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.280" offset="3313894">And this Court has said in City of Chicago that there is no appeal by a private person from that decision not to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.765" offset="3343778">On the other hand, if the ICC does investigate the discontinuance and passes upon it, an aggrieved party can appeal that ruling to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.798" offset="3391948">It seems to us clear that certainly in regard to the basic system, it makes no sense whatever to allow an aggrieved party to bypass this procedure which has been established and to rush in to the District Court with an original suit even before the ICC had a chance to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.900" offset="3456313">In other words, so that I’m clear, a notice is given a discontinuance and before the ICC even gets to decide whether it’s going to investigate private party runs into the District Court and brings on original suit and wants to sue because of the discontinuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.128" offset="3509290">That doesn’t make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.278" offset="3517858">As to the non-basic system track, certainly the Court would not allow a private party, a broader authority to attack the discontinuance of a non-basic system train than it would, a basic system train because Congress has specifically provided right here in the Act that a non-basic system train can be discontinued at any time just with 30 days notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.057" offset="3624960">And the Congressional will having been expressed that you can discontinue that easily a non-basic service train, it certainly makes no sense to allow an aggrieved person to run into Court and attempt to attack it.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.854" offset="3672189">So on all of these grants it seems to us on the basis -- the statutory language as it stands, on the basis of the legislative history which I pointed out where the aggrieved party was specifically left out on the basis of the public interest involved and seen that Amtrak can really operate and discontinue, etcetera and finally on the basis of common sense in the light of the legislative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.370" offset="3766230">We think that clearly that District Court was right in throwing out this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.711" offset="3783576">I might just add that the Attorney General, the responsible official under the Act agrees with us as expressed both in letters and by the position of the Solicitor General which has been filed before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.544" offset="3838955">The United States agrees that aggrieved parties cannot sue and that the responsible official for bringing lawsuits for discontinuance etcetera is the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.089" offset="3877094">I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time unless the Court has questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.108" offset="4385228">And one of the legislator recommendations of DOT was to eliminate judicial review of passenger train discontinuance as Congress did not adopt that recommendation and the extensive amendments which were approved by the president last week do not embrace any changes to section 307 (a) or to the right of persons to take decisions of the ICC and pass the discontinuance cases to Court and for judicial review left -- that part was left unchanged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.044" offset="4604970">And that the discontinuance which took place on May 1, 1971 purportedly under Section 401 (a), one of the Act was in violation of the Act and breached its duty to the public the way every passenger train operating between those two cities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.029" offset="4776856">The purpose was to prevent the complete abandonment of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.125" offset="5573277">Just consequently he would be opposed to meeting any person to seek enforcement of the Act of Section 307.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.239" offset="5593652">As he looked at the Sanctions. something above and beyond judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.485" offset="5610684">And then he said with respect to inclusion of railroads, he said he thinks existing statutes apply to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.994" offset="5660735">The consequent basis I am not sure that would be necessary to make Sanctions applicable to any railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.641" offset="11191275">Now let’s go back before the Act was passed and follow this through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.785" offset="11211860">And Mr. Justice White raised the key question here, this Act is not cutoff a right which was a prior right which existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.240" offset="11249685">Before this Act was passed, in so far as the Nancy Hanks wan concern, a party could not go to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.072" offset="11285002">He would do one or two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.659" offset="11291376">If the Nancy Hanks -- the Railroad wanted to cutoff the Nancy Hanks, they would go first if they wanted to to the state, the Public Service Commission of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.441" offset="11326485">If they didn’t’ get relief there, they could go under 13 (a) 2 before the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.082" offset="11353025">He could not -- a private party could not go to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.010" offset="11364833">He could bring a complaint before the Public Service Commission or the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.052" offset="11380924">But if the ICC decided to do nothing about it, as Mr. Justice Douglas said for the Court in the City of Chicago, it was no right of appeal of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.633" offset="11419272">So before the Act in terms of an intrastate train like the Nancy Hanks, the procedure was administrative and you went to Court only if the ICC took the matter or passed upon it and decided for example that it wasn’t going to discontinue, then and only then there was a right to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.148" offset="11497326">Now in terms of trains 13 and 14 which were interstate, what happened before this Act was that again the private party could make a complaint to the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.669" offset="11543406">The ICC, if it decided not to investigate, that ended the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.004" offset="11560751">If it decided to investigate and pass on the merits then there was an appeal to three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.621" offset="11587187">So this Act didn’t cutbakc -- cutoff a right which existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.561" offset="11607040">This Act substituted a slightly different system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.214" offset="11621564">Now here’s what happens under the Act, if it is a basic system train --</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.562" offset="11767014">And they go before the ICC and they file their notice and the ICC either decides to do nothing, let it be discontinued in which case as this Court has said there is no appeal or it decides to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.155" offset="11821349">It makes the decision on the merits and then there is the normal appeal through the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.279" offset="11841829">Now as to excess trains, that is trains which are not part of the basic system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.891" offset="11896268">In so far as those trains are concern, they can be discontinued at anytime with two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.807" offset="11932003">There has to be a 30-day notice to alert the public so they can make their plans and so forth.</text>
