            <text syncTime="94.059" offset="452963">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.928" offset="468428">This is a suit brought by a group of parents in private church schools in Kansas City against the State Commissioner of Education of Missouri and the members of the State Board of Education, charging that the plaintiffs were deprived of their rights under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.613" offset="603220">The complaint is a rather broad ranging document, but as the case progressed, the issue became quite narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.576" offset="655047">The crux of the controversy revolves around a policy adopted by the State of Missouri that to assign publicly employed teachers to perform their educational services in private and specifically religious schools, would be contrary to the law of the State of Missouri and, that this law was applicable to Title I teachers as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.273" offset="793809">The defense was that the Act does not mandate, does not require assignment of Title I teachers to teach in church schools and, if it did, that to that extent the Act is contrary to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.280" offset="917838">The District Court ruled in favor of the defendants on the ground that the statute did not mandate such assignments, and stated further that if it did, it would raise grave constitutional issues under the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.794" offset="991922">The Court of Appeals reversed two-to-one with Judge Stevenson’s dissent and remanded the case to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.141" offset="1037270">On the basis of that remand, the District Court entered a final judgment, the critical sentence of which is found on page a46 of the petition for certiorari which says defendants are enjoined from disapproving any publication of the local education agency for the grant of the Federal Title I ESCA Funds on the basis that such publication includes the use of Title I personnel on private school premises during the regular school of hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.457" offset="1898580">We interpret the order as an injunction forbidding us, and this is the issue before the Court, forbidding us to refuse to assign teachers to teach at parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.245" offset="1953750">This is the injunction which is -- we’re operating on.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.166" offset="1965453">And, in order to make sure that this is before the Court, when we filed our petition for certiorari, we filed it with a two-pronged petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.936" offset="2008503">We filed a petition for certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but we also had the alternative to review the order and judgment of the District Court ordering us not to refuse a program for sending paroch -- public school teachers into parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.866" offset="2092199">The fact situation of this case, as veiled on the trial and as it developed, was just one narrow thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.818" offset="2132010">We have here, in Missouri as in many states that Title I Program is limited to teaching, reading, and arithmetic, occasionally, some other similar subjects like in summer schools shop or something, but basically, reading and arithmetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.919" offset="2208392">And, the record shows what the Title I is.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.958" offset="2240575">If we look at page 43 of my brief, we find the -- a typical application, a typical application for Title I Fund by a local agency which is pretty much the same and it gives a whole fact to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.820" offset="2324062">A reading specialist that’s paragraph 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.388" offset="2342348">A reading specialist who assists classroom teachers in daily development reading, instruction that provide corrective or remedial reading instruction of groups of 4-10 on a regularly scheduled basis, program reading text with a variety of supplementary materials combined with pupils’ creative writing and teacher-made materials will be utilized to extent as teaching kit.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.830" offset="2428029">This is a typical thing which is done in all this schools, private and public and this is the crux.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.470" offset="2454674">This is what we’re contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.334" offset="2462093">We’re not required to do under that statute and if we are, the statute, to that extent, violates the Establishment Clause and that is a dual question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.047" offset="2512980">Now, I'll address myself to the statutory instruction and I think, statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.056" offset="2552999">I think the first thing to do, of course, is to look at the text of the statute, that is found on page 16 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.645" offset="2599288">It says that a state agency in -- shall not approve any of these local agencies project unless it’s determined, that to the extent consistent with a number of educationally deprived children in the school district of the local education agency, while rolled private elementary and secondary school, such agency has made provision for including special educational service and arrangements such as dual enrollment, educational radio and television and mobile education services and equipment where such children can participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.899" offset="2752366">Now, I should like to call the Court’s attention to the examples given in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.033" offset="2776921">The first one which is critical, dual enrollment; what does dual enrollment mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="682.230" offset="2805656">It’s stated in the regulations, it explains what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.212" offset="2821642">Dual enrollment, sometimes called shared time is when pupils in a private school, registered in a private school, go into the public school for some, but not all of their courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.691" offset="2891546">This Act provides, it is permissible to meet the requirements of the statute to take pupils from the private schools and bring them into the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.132" offset="2945254">Clearly, this is just the opposite of sending the school teacher into the private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.865" offset="2976183">So that, the Act on its face, as giving an example, this is not the only sin committed, there are just such acts, as one example of what is permissible which would meet the requirement of the Act, is to send the children into the public school rather than the sending of the public school teacher into the private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.532" offset="3074926">So that, it is clear without further that the statute does not mandate, but apparently, the Court of Appeals mandates and the District Court mandates, you must send them into the parochial school if you sent them into the public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.268" offset="3129783">Secondly, the situation in Missouri, where the law is interpreted by the State Board of Education is not to permit this, was called to the attention of the HEW very early in the letter specifically addressed to this problem, sent to the Assistant Commissioner of Education that we have the response of the Commissioner of Education on page 19 and 20 which, in the light, this is in 1967, in the light of the specific Missouri situation said “no, it’s not required.”</text>
            <text syncTime="810.626" offset="3319223">The statute does not mandate any particular form so long as you provide services for the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.159" offset="3357362">Then, we have another, there are many more, but another indicia, in the handbook of the HEW or Commissioner of Education, which again recognizes, and I call this Court’s attention to that paragraph which I’ve quoted on page 22 of our brief in which refers again to the situation, it’s called logistics on page 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.978" offset="3460702">It says not the least of difficulties in including private school children in Title I activities, are the problem, schedule, transportation, hiring and assignment of personnel, purchasing inventory equipment, and arrangements for space.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.514" offset="5166811">What I am trying to point out in this, this is an administrative interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.738" offset="5207667">And, the administrative interpretation says there are logistic problems in various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.411" offset="5226371">One of the logistic problems arises when state law forbids to assign public personnel to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.919" offset="5264405">Now, if the Court of Appeals is correct that state law is irrelevant, then the HEW would have said there’s no logistic problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.107" offset="5321143">Simply, the law requires that whatever the state law is, the federal statute, that you must decide to serve in private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.500" offset="5362730">Then no logistics at all, the fact that they said in the second paragraph that there are no easy solutions, and however, when the leader solution allows several options, then good faith will work something up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.002" offset="5420722">But, this is a recognition by HEW that you are not mandated to send public school teachers into the private school even to avoid logistic problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.124" offset="5477251">I would like to devote the rest of my time here up to the amount I’m reserving, except for that I’m reserving for rebuttal, to the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.453" offset="5538586">In the event we are incorrect, in the event that this Court decides that where certain services are provided for educational services by Title I teachers, the Title I teachers must go into the church schools to perform those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.797" offset="5631896">We would suggest that, to that extent, the statute violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.470" offset="5678602">Now in saying that, it’s important to know that the issue before this Court in this case it's quite narrow, we are not challenging other Title I services which are permitted under the statute, including those specifically stated in the statute as mobile equipment, nor those which HEW has, in its interpretation of the application of the law, held to be permissible such as breakfasts or medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.348" offset="5814126">We do not challenge sending the doctor in or a hot breakfast with cooks to prepare it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.527" offset="5842860">We are challenging only about the basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.250" offset="5857698">And, the record shows basically the same type of teaching of regular subjects, most prominently reading and arithmetic, which goes into the public schools except what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.198" offset="5917571">Except smaller classes and specially trained or teachers given a special additional training of task force how to handle students who are below the norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.590" offset="5971069">And that, too, appears in the typical application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.207" offset="5993535">Again, I ask the Court to turn to page 43 of my brief which is typical application, item four, degree of education deprivation necessary for participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.151" offset="6053303">Below norm on standardized test by three months for primary school, six months for intermediate, nine months for Grade Seven, if a student is below those norms, he is put into a smaller class, and that’s indicated, and he’s given a teacher and the teachers will be given a crash course under HEW sponsorship on how to handle that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.135" offset="6145254">Now, these students who are below norm are not students who are, psychologically, problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.212" offset="6193633">They are ordinary students who for variety reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.525" offset="6202828">The best example is the one which the Court of Appeals gave in its opinion on page -- which I cite on page a45, footnote 13 of the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.437" offset="6282449">A45, no, a15, I’m sorry, a15 on the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.285" offset="6341904">It says the record discloses that Our Lady of the American School, a parochial school in Kansas City, has a student body that is 98% excellent with approximately 175 students eligible for Title I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.579" offset="6407105">Children are confronted with a language and cultural problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.888" offset="6420271">Now, that’s all I want to read from the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.142" offset="6429362">What do we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.900" offset="6432392">We have students who, because they’re foreign-born, are slower than the average.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.127" offset="6453290">But, the instruction given is basically the same thing as the instructions given in other students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.392" offset="6478367">Now, it’s our contention that in that context this case is indistinguishable from Lemon against Kurtzman, Earley against DiCenso, and Sanders against Johnson, where this Court said you cannot finance a secular instruction in church schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.247" offset="6565721">What is the difference? The education is basically the same, ordinary secular education and even in the Lemon against Kurtzman, they chose these secular courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.979" offset="6604696">What is the only difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.736" offset="6615667">The only difference between this situation and the Lemon, DiCenso, Johnson cases is that, in this situation the teachers are paid directly and hired directly by the public agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.640" offset="6683272">In the other cases, the teachers are hired originally by the parochial schools but paid in whole and part out of public funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.026" offset="6744816">We say this because of a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.702" offset="6763520">We say that in sum that the potential for comfort, and I’m reading now from the Levitt decision which this Court decided last year and quoting from the Lemon decision, “the potential for conflict in here, in this situation, just as it did in the Levitt and the DiCenso, Lemon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.799" offset="6875951">We show, we argue, and we show from the record that, as it operates, it is perfectly permissible, for example, it is perfectly permissible for the parochial school to take one of its teachers or more, divorce them, sever them from the payroll and assign them as a Title I teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.990" offset="6968738">They get special training and they come back only to stay in the same schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.610" offset="6987233">They have now been transferred simply from one payroll to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.125" offset="7001234">They do the same thing except they are now under public payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.802" offset="7019938">Moreover, and this is the -- and this is interesting that they may even be employed simultaneously by both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.069" offset="7101022">If you -- and the regulations which I quote on page 5 of my brief, page 5 in the brief says as follows: provisions for Section -- this is from the regulations CFR Section 116, “Provision for special education services for educationally deprived children enrolled in private schools shall not include the paying of salaries for teachers or other employees of private schools.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.544" offset="7238949">Now, the next is critical, “except for services performed outside their regular hours of duty and under public supervision and control.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.620" offset="7275207">In other words, what this allows is for a parochial school teacher to teach under the payroll of the parochial school for part time and under the payroll of the Title I, the other part of the title, so long as it is beyond the regular hours of the parochial school teacher and a parochial school teacher can be hired from 9-3 or from 9-1 or 9-12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.945" offset="7404565">Moreover, the -- while you’re looking, you have the severe problem of the fact that a church school is a church school and it doesn’t become something else when a public school, publicly employed teacher enters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.143" offset="7497352">That is why the courts which have been faced with this issue, with respect to state law, and the District Court in the case which I cite, (Inaudible) against Oaktree, the District Court in the First Circuit said -- which involved a state statute, a state statute which says that public school, publicly appointed teachers out of state funds may teach in parochial schools, they declared not unconstitutional and, I commend to this Court, the Court’s opinion, there was a thorough discussion of it indicating that the potential for -- the law of the constitution, as interpreted by this Court, in Nyquist, in Levitt, in Lemon, DiCenso, and each of the cases said that in a situation such as this it is an obligation to make certain, to make certain that the publicly employed teacher does not use his position for the advancement of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.063" offset="7841019">The -- this Court said in Nyquist, and I quote it on page 30 referring to the DiCenso case, about page 30, the role on legislature has not and could not provide state aid on the basis of a mere assumption that secular teachers under religious discipline can avoid conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.467" offset="7978632">The state and this is emphasized, the emphasis is not mine, the emphasis of this Court in a Nyquist case referring to the DiCenso case, the state must be certain, given the religious cause, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.335" offset="8050103">And the Court found there, in both, Nyquist, Levitt, DiCenso, Lemon, that there was no such certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.750" offset="8087719">There is no such certainty in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.810" offset="8095974">All there is, is a statement in the rule, in the regulations that the Title I teachers may not teach religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.677" offset="9023425">Let me try to outline our position in this case as it has been from the time we filed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.310" offset="9045995">We say that the Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 provided that comparable educational services for educationally deprived children relating to special educational benefits must be provided on the basis consistent with their number and the extent of their educational deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.374" offset="9122273">We say that this had to be done on a comparable basis across the board for public and non-public children alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.422" offset="9150485">We say that, in carrying this out, certain regulations were promulgated by the Office of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.342" offset="9182145">We say that this is a federal law, funded entirely by federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.689" offset="9199491">It’s a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.536" offset="9202939">There’s no matching funds, no state funds of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.186" offset="9217463">We say that in Missouri the State Board of Education, very early in the game, took steps to preclude either dual enrollment or the mobile educational service of sending the teacher in -- the public school teacher into the private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.316" offset="9277962">We say that in almost every situation, when the state board precluded those two methods of participation in the -- by the private school, the private school children could not, did not, have not received their fair equitable, comparable participation in Title I benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.411" offset="9374407">We say that in Missouri we recognize that there’s a compulsory attendance statute that the Court of Appeals referred to, that the Supreme Court of Missouri has interpreted as to preclude dual enrollment or shared time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.802" offset="9427905">We say that if we’re going to accommodate that decision and that state law as the Court of Appeals suggests, the only thing and the only other way that we can receive comparable educational benefits in the private -- for the private school children is by sending the public school Title I teacher into the private school to teach the educationally deprived qualified eligible non-public school children and to give them the Title I benefits in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.675" offset="9559458">We say generally that this is constitutional for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.125" offset="9577221">We say that the regulations in the Act have made a provision that would make it beyond and question, it seems to me, affected by the Establishment Clause and we say that the relief directed by the Court of Appeals and implemented by the injunction in the order of the District Court is a proper, lawful, and clearly warranted holding of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.313" offset="14353972">I do want to mention the constitutional issue, of course, since counsel raised it and goes into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.450" offset="14394514">The essential thing is that all of the secular benefits to be rendered under this Act or clearly be marked, described, and complied by the, if not -- not only by the statute, but by the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.987" offset="14464731">Now this is not, as counsel would suggest in his brief again today, this is not a case of general educational aid across the board, that’s not it at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3616.111" offset="14541218">The Act and the statute are confined to special and particular educational benefits for educationally deprived children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.973" offset="14568594">They are not designed as a general aid to education in non-public or public schools, either one, but particularly, in private schools, can these benefits be used to add to or to replace and existing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.043" offset="14632960">The -- I think that is made abundantly clear throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.334" offset="14658038">The provision that, suggested in the brief, as to the payment of private school teachers is a -- well, one example suggested by the petitioners is without any merit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.964" offset="14712581">They refer to the handbook as giving authority to pay private school teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.448" offset="14730553">What the handbook says is that when private school teachers are attending an “in service” training session, they can get their lunch money and their transportation money if they’re working on Title I project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.398" offset="14774335">It has nothing to do with this Act whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.197" offset="14789486">The other portion, of course, if the person is working full time in a private school, then that person can be teaching summer school under Title I program or anything else can be paid by the taking of other employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4009.637" offset="16115252">It seems to me that we have a much clearer case than the Allen case because, in the Allen case, at least in two of the dissenting opinions seemed to be predicated on the relief that these people could, in private schools, could select their own books about historical events and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="4041.701" offset="16243566">I think it’s well within the rule of Allen in that there’s -- I don’t think there’s any question here about the secular purpose or even the primary effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.956" offset="16280555">I think the Congress anticipated the words of this court set out in Norwood versus Harrison that any program with a legitimate purpose that’s based between the effect and the entanglement problems is constitutional under the Establishment Clause and that’s what the Congress did here, and that’s what the Office of Education requires in all of its regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4091.174" offset="16441469">At the outset, I would like just briefly to explain to the Court how Title I of the educate -- the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 operates because I think that’s crucial to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.283" offset="16497894">The statute was passed because of a recognition by the President and the Congress that there’s a large number, literally millions, of educationally deprived children in this country who, because of lack of adequate education, would not be able to assume their rightful and proper place in American society.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.201" offset="16601548">And, the basic purpose of this statute as described in the congressional declaration of policy at the outset of the statute was to enable the local educational authorities to meet the special educational needs of educationally deprived children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.636" offset="16675318">The focus of the Act, the way the Act is created, is to turnover vast amounts of federal money to the State Educational Authorities in order to correct, in order to improve the deficiencies that existed in the education of these educationally deprived children and, it deals with children who come from poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.564" offset="16766955">The basic touchstone for getting the aid is that the children must come from areas of the city of the country where the income level is low.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.071" offset="16809064">Now the plan, as it’s envisioned, basically is as follows: The states initially apply to the Commissioner of Education for authorization, a rather simple document for which they all filed and were -- these documents were approved 89 years ago saying they wished to participate in the program and they will meet the statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.128" offset="16897254">The statutory standards are very general.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.634" offset="16911256">What it says, basically, is that the State Educational Authority shall approve applications filed by local authorities which are consistent with the guidelines promulgated by the Commissioner of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.698" offset="16971546">The Commissioner of Education just promulgated guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="5171.617" offset="20763167">I respectfully suggest that the statute does not limit and there is no basis for saying that the only alternatives open to a state are either sending the public school teacher in or dual enrollment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.621" offset="20827220">The “such as” indicates that these are illustrative, are things which are permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.316" offset="20846028">Another point I shall like to make, and this is in response to a statement made by Mr. Sullivan in response to a question by a member of the Court, that if the State of Missouri -- the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri had ruled, for example, that dual enrollment under Title I is not inconsistent with state law, the State Board of Education takes a position that it could ignore it and deem itself to be the only judge, I think that, obviously, it’s not such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.783" offset="20979879">Of course, we are a state agency, we are subject to the judgments of a State Supreme Court, and indeed, our position is based upon our interpretation of a State Supreme Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.654" offset="21027318">If the State Supreme Court says to us it is not a violation of state law to do your dual enrollment or sending Type I teachers in, we’re bound by that, if not, there’ll be a judgment of contempt against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.469" offset="21098580">We say only that in between, in respect, the relationship, the inter-government relationship between the State of Missouri and the United States Office of Education that the initial responsibility of determining the state law rests with the State Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.021" offset="21200875">Now, this leads us to another point in respect with the abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.003" offset="21232744">In the District Court, when the case first came up, we did not initially ask for abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.329" offset="21266077">The reason for that was that we took the position that state law was clear in that our responsibility under state law was clear that there was no question of state law as far as the federal district was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.074" offset="21321038">The question was the State of Missouri, speaking through its State Board of Education, ruled that this was not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.423" offset="21370462">Then, the court of its own raised it and we then replied that if this court deems that this is relevant, then it should abstain and we so argued it, that it's abstained until a State Court decision could be reached, but the Court of Appeals said that state law is irrelevant.</text>
