            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments next in 72-1019, Sea-Land Services against Gaudet.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.334" offset="258090">Mr. McClendon.</text>

          <turn speaker="stuart_a_mcclendon" startTime="48.142" stopTime="457.877">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. McClendon</label>
            <text syncTime="48.142" offset="269270">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.034" offset="292885">We are here today for a discussion and hopefully a clarification of the rights of litigants under the general maritime law and under the wrongful-death recovery allowed by the Court in the Moragne case in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.608" offset="407197">At that time when the Court overruled the Harrisburg and allowed recovery under general maritime law for wrongful-death, the Court did not set any stringent or specific guidelines for future cases but stated that the siftings through the Court would bring about hopefully a consistent law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.367" offset="514194">In the case before us today, Mr. Gaudet was injured in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.092" offset="533107">He was a foreman longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.182" offset="541466">He was injured aboard a vessel in the Mississippi River in the Port of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.637" offset="559334">He instituted suit in U.S. District Court and brought it to judgment for the amount of $175,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.913" offset="588382">Ten days after the Jury award which was rendered in the Court of proper jurisdiction, Mr. Gaudet died.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.488" offset="626730">His widow did not come in to those proceedings requesting any damages for his death or any modification of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.213" offset="665600">Post-trial, motions were filed and these were rejected by the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.255" offset="689737">The matter was appealed to the Fifth Circuit and the appeal failed and the judgment was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.015" offset="716800">Mrs. Gaudet proceeded with a separate suit alleging that she had sustained severe financial loss as a result of the death of her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.992" offset="764761">And after reversing the Trial Court’s rejection of her claim, the Fifth Circuit had rendered the decision stating that the previously received judgment was not a bar to her actions for wrongful-death.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.818" offset="839993">We would like to briefly point out that the Courts have recognized although at times have been confused over the difference between a survival action and a wrongful-death action, survival being purely the right of the survivors of a decedent to recover for the damages which she sustained during his lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.651" offset="939363">The survival action the damages there terminated to the time of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.974" offset="960679">The wrongful-death action on the other hand, is a right of recovery for the decedents for their damages sustained after the death of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.346" offset="1018149">This Court has dealt with these matters in Flynn case and the Mellon versus Goodyear and the Michigan versus Vreeland cases and all of these were FELA cases which took Lord Campbell’s Act which had -- which was referred to in the Moragne decision and said that the right of recovery for wrongful-death is a right which only exist if in the decedent there existed a right at the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.247" offset="1153776">And we are here today because the Fifth Circuit has said that even though Mr. Gaudet had received a judgment, had obtained a judgment that in some manner, the widow had a right to go file with the claim for wrongful-death.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.445" offset="1230576">We submit that the claim for wrongful death is a derivative action and is derived from the initial tort, the initial injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.038" offset="1272895">We're not dealing of an instantaneous death which was not dealt within these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.870" offset="1296196">We're dealing with an injury which results in certain injuries to the individual and then it's some time later there is death, weeks or months or in some of these cases many years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.194" offset="1349486">And the Courts have held especially under Mellon Case that the right is a derivative right and it derive from the original injury which the injured man sustained at the time he was involved in the accident, and if there is no viable cause of action or right on his part, immediately prior to his death, that his heirs cannot renew their right to claim their damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.104" offset="1477172">This is the question which -- one of the questions before the Court today, we also submitted on our petition for writs that if the Court should find that -- that the recovery is proper, then the uniformity which is desired in Federal Law and admiralty and maritime matters and which has been consistently followed in the Jones Act in the Death on the High Seas and in the cases since Moragne in 1972 that the Fifth Circuit was departing from this by allowing damages for nonpecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.940" offset="1624503">All of the cases under the Jones Act, Death on the High Seas in general maritime law have stated that the claim of the defendant, the damages of the defendant must pay are pecuniary and loss of love and affection, society, companionship, consortium are not recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.898" offset="1716349">Since Mrs. Gaudet inherited the judgment of her husband in the amount of a $175,000.00 and eventually collected it, we submit that this is full pecuniary recovery for the damages that were sustained, and that the only recovery which we submit, there should not be any but if the Court should say that in some manner a cause of action exist even though there wasn’t one at the time of death, then, we submit that in order to maintain uniformity that only non -- only pecuniary losses should be allowed and that this have already been paid in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.328" offset="1882070">This is the matter before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.322" offset="1894087">If the Court has any questions, we would be happy to --</text>

            <text syncTime="499.086" offset="2073078">No, Your Honor, except for the fact that we submit that it became a property right which was then inherited by the heirs at the time of death that when the Jury award was rendered that a cause of action ceased to exist and it was merged into a property right which was then inherited by her.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.587" offset="2167118">That the cause of action was not pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.372" offset="2178194">If it had been pending, if there was a pending claim at the time of death, we feel the law is clear that there can be an amendment or a merger of the claim of the decedent for his damages into a wrongful-death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.129" offset="2253218">But if the claim of the decedent for his damages has been terminated by settlement, by proscription, by statute of limitations or by judgment, then their -- this precludes any right of the heirs, of the –-</text>
