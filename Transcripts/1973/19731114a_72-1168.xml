            <text syncTime="966.605" offset="3943131">Now the first is the, what we consider to be other failure of the Government’s proof upon the issue of knowing use of the mails including the so called delay issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.830" offset="3992033">The second point is the reasonableness, propriety, and or the necessity of extending federal criminal jurisdiction to this case and other cases similar to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.040" offset="4352940">Now, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in this case, I think should be pointed out was not as broadly drawn as the Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.111" offset="4397244">It said that a very carefully drawn opinion and it said essentially that the Government did not prove in this case by the evidence of record that Maze could have foreseen or knew that mails would be used or that the mails were inescapably direct incident between the defrauding of the innkeepers and the defrauding of the bank.</text>

            <label>Mr. William T. Warner</label>
            <text syncTime="1147.320" offset="4665992">Well, this is a question in this case that some of the Circuits have raised with respect to charging a defendant such as Maze with a detailed knowledge of the very complex and intricate commercial scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.504" offset="4746762">I assume that the mails were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.458" offset="4754599">I would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.338" offset="4762122">But there may be other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.862" offset="4768183">I don’t know how the banks transmit matters of this type and maybe like they do checks through the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.087" offset="4813113">Now, Mr. Chief Justice, in response on this proof issue, I think it’s significant in response partially to a question that you addressed to Mrs. Lafontant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.011" offset="4852820">Maze did testify in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.054" offset="4860970">In other way testified, in his own behalf, but he gave a statement to the Postal Inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.676" offset="4883435">Now, neither the Postal Inspectors or the Assistant United States Attorney who tried the case addressed one single question to Maze on the knowing use of the mails or did he know or did he contemplate or could you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.055" offset="4944980">In order the Government introduced any other witness as on this issue as to how the mails are necessary incident of this type of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.878" offset="4992209">Now, also, I want to point out that at this point, that the Government contends that there are six circuits which support this so called per se doctrine that the fraudulent use of a credit card is per se the use of the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.387" offset="5058247">Now, if my reading of the cases does not support this view, there are at least two Circuits, the Fifth certainly in the Adams case which was the fundamental case on the per se doctrine supports this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.330" offset="5122090">The Seventh Circuit does and perhaps, I am sorry, the Second Circuit in the Kellerman series of cases and most recently the Third Circuit in the Ciotti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.548" offset="5166916">Now, the other cases involved varying kinds of fraud. And as the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Isaac’s case in 1968 that the forms of fraud which are possible under the mail fraud statute are multifarious as human ingenuity can device, and I think that this should be kept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.524" offset="5262838">Now, the Government case on the knowing use of the mails issue, we submit is built on a series of presuppositions and assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.317" offset="5305992">Now, it’s long been the rule under our system of jurisprudence that we don’t convict people upon presuppositions and assumptions, and that this as were partially at least where the Government case failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.441" offset="5362521">Now, as I stated earlier in response to Chief Justice’s question, the trouble with the per se doctrine, that is the doctrine that the fraudulent presentation and/or use of the credit card per se involves the mail is that this imposes on the defendant a detailed knowledge of a very complex commercial mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.905" offset="5448411">And again, there is no proof in this record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.925" offset="5464398">Now, the Sixth Circuit in this case stated specifically that they were not holding that credit card abuse could never constitute mail fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.383" offset="5506299">They stated in this case, in this case that the Government’s proof had failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.260" offset="5529809">Now, with regard to the alleged scheme, I think the facts are significant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.039" offset="5552901">The card was misappropriated stolen on April 10, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.928" offset="5580487">Now, Maze was arrested and in jail on May 9, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.420" offset="5606400">Now, there was no extensive long range scheme such as the one in the Chason case which is the Second Circuit case involving a man who obtained a credit card or series of credit cards and was engaged in procuring airline tickets or in the Ciotti case, Kellerman where you had long range extensive schemes where one credit card after another was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.215" offset="5737639">Now, also, the other cases that upheld use of the mails as part of the or as covered under mail fraud statute have involved other types of people, businessmen who submitted fraudulent statements for the purpose of getting credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.172" offset="5813394">The Pereira case, a very sophisticated person who as the Court knows had had frauded a widow over a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.943" offset="5856549">Now, it is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.181" offset="5869505">Now, I want to point out to the Court that I am not saying or arguing this morning that Maze didn’t know that the mails would be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.979" offset="5892702">The point is that the Government didn’t prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.742" offset="5903673">Now, as long as we’re dealing as the Government is in presuppositions and assumptions, I think there are some other assumptions that could just as recently be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.536" offset="5946932">That Maze presumably could have counted on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.193" offset="5957486">One, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think alluded to yesterday and that is the Chief Justice, the fact that the vendors themselves might for some reason delay a week or ten days sending in their invoices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.312" offset="6026031">It’s possible that Maze could have known and counted on the fact that credit card issuer such as the banks customarily collects statements over a 30-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.450" offset="6078589">Now, Maze first went to California, that invoice was sent in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.777" offset="6095830">The bank didn’t bill him Meredith right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.908" offset="6104398">They waited until the end of the month, collected all his invoices, and sent them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.702" offset="6127595">Another presupposition which could be indulged in this case is that Maze could have counted on the fact of a possible breakdown in the Citizens Fidelity Banks lost card or stolen card procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.953" offset="6192588">Obviously, it may take ten days to two weeks for the vendors themselves to be notified and in this case, one vendor did testify that it took three weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.378" offset="6602292">And there, as the Court recalls, a gambler or a person running a gambling establishment in Florida just over the Georgia land was charged with a violation of the Travel Act and the basis of that prosecution was that he could reasonably foresee that people would travel interstate from Georgia to patronize his gambling establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.009" offset="6684735">And the Court struck down that presumption and raised an interesting point that I think may be applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.750" offset="7247726">The Government says that because the defendant in this case, Maze intended the fraud that which was clearly a criminal act, and the jury so found that is not contested, but because he intended the criminal act, therefore, he intended an entirely separate criminal act which is the use of the mail to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.079" offset="7345110">And in my view, and I respectfully submit to the Court, the two just don’t connect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.992" offset="7372696">Now, the second point that maybe and certainly is we feel applicable here is what we consider to be an unwarranted, unnecessary extension of federal criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.153" offset="7425358">Now, it’s an elemental principle that federal criminal jurisdiction can be conferred only by express congressional grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.449" offset="7474573">Now, this principle does not and we do not argue here this morning, prevent the courts or the Justice Department in any way from a reasonable construction of a criminal statute, but in this case, it’s unnecessary and I’d like to outline why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.891" offset="7548343">Now, in two recent cases, one I have already mentioned, the Rewis case and also in the case of the United States versus Bass which was also a 1971 case, the Court enunciated certain policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.078" offset="7601110">Now, I don’t submit that these cases are analogous to the Maze case because both of those cases involved a single statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.382" offset="7626292">Here as Mr. Justice Brennan has pointed out there are in effect two statutes that we are dealing with, but the Court there, in those cases stated that federal jurisdiction should not be unnecessarily injected in the areas which would affect this sensitive state federal balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.767" offset="7711765">Now, the policy apparently from the teaching in those cases is that without a clear statement from the Congress that no such expansion would be permitted or sanctioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.694" offset="7759517">Now, we submit in this case, in the Maze case that there has been such a clear statement by Congress and that is in the form of Title 15, Section 1644.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.601" offset="7815105">Now, I want to call the Court’s attention to the legislative history of this particular statute which is set forth in full at page 17 of our brief, but I think it’s clear from that legislative history as recited in the Congressional record from statements and remarks made by, particularly by Senator Long on the Florida Senate that the Court, I’m sorry, the Congress felt that there was no adequate protection for credit card fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.833" offset="7940075">Now, there’s one other significant point with regard to the enactment of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.653" offset="7959406">The original Senate Bill as was passed was Section 134 of Title 5, I believe of the Truth in Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.489" offset="7998694">The original Senate Bill had no jurisdictional limitation other than the interstate commerce requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.369" offset="8026175">The Justice Department came in and said, “We want a $5,000 jurisdictional limitation in this because of the administrative problems that we anticipate encountering in administering such a broadly drawn statute” and the statute was subsequently enacted with the $5,000 requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.279" offset="8121887">Now, I think it’s clear, again, from statement or policy that can be gleaned from a recent case in this Court, the Erlenbaugh decision which was decided a little less than a year ago, Erlenbaugh against United States, that a later Act in this case 15 U.S.C. 1644, can to a great extent to be regarded as a legislative interpretation of an earlier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.940" offset="8232542">And certainly it’s, I think a well-settled principle of statutory construction that whenever Confess passes a new statute it acts aware of all previous statutes in the same general area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.324" offset="8290011">Now, the Rewis case also states, expresses this Court’s concern with the over extension of limited federal police resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.697" offset="8331494">And I think it’s ironic in this case, to a great extent that the Justice Department in 1970 in urging a jurisdictional limitation upon the Congress expressed almost the same concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.168" offset="8397427">Now, as we point out in our brief on the necessity issue, each of the four states involved has a specific statute dealing with credit card fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.268" offset="8449776">The State of Kentucky where the Citizens Fidelity Bank is located which was the bank that ended up with the payment in this case, Kentucky has probably one of the most detailed tough credit card statutes in the country and it provides for misdemeanor and felony penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.448" offset="8530547">Now in this case, Maze would have been subjected to very heavy felony penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.770" offset="8547788">So it's not a question, I submit, of either the Federal Government entering the field or having a felon escape punishment, this is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.230" offset="8597629">Now, there has been no showing by the Government in this case that Kentucky Officials, Louisville Police, State of Kentucky are either unwilling or were either unwilling or unable to prosecute Maze for this offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.145" offset="10673319">Now, one other final point, with regard to a point or question that was raised yesterday by Mrs. Lafontant about this business of concurrent sentences as I point out in our footnote in our brief, I don’t think there’s any question that the five-year sentence at least under the Dyer Act conviction was answered by the four convictions under the mail fraud statute if this conviction or the Sixth Circuit decision stands, we would anticipate a motion under Rule 35 to District Court for reduction of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.703" offset="10807589">A five-year sentence in the District Court of Western District on a Dyer Act conviction is rather unprecedented. Now again, the Government, I think to a great extent in this case, has lit off a kind of a smoky bonfire on this issue of unless the Court overturns the Sixth Circuit decision that the entire credit card system is going to breakdown, I don’t think that’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.487" offset="10926707">I think their adequate state laws and I think that the existing federal statutes would prevent that.</text>
