            <text syncTime="45.117" offset="257254">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.730" offset="275644">This case is before this Court on a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals of the Fourteenth Supreme Judicial District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.921" offset="328411">The Texas Court held that under the rule of San Diego Building Trades Council against Garmon, that its jurisdiction was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act and that it could not adjudicate petitions seeking injunctive relief under state law against picketing by American unions which was directed against foreign flagships.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.779" offset="455889">And which protested that the wages of the crews on such ships were substandard.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.579" offset="491102">The picketing prevented the ships from being either loaded or unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.102" offset="517120">The petitioners in this case or the Windward Shipping Company -- the Windward Shipping (London) Ltd.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.244" offset="545750">which is a British company, it’s a managing agent of one of the picketing ships, one of the picketed ships, and the other two companies are the Liberian Corporations which own the respective vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.053" offset="600921">The respondents are six American unions representing a licensed and unlicensed seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.526" offset="642821">The facts are as follows, both of the ships are registered under the laws of Liberia and both fly the Liberian flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.317" offset="682005">Both are engagement solely in carrying cargo in international trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.965" offset="740624">They work under wages and working conditions which are established in foreign ships articles and which are in accordance with foreign collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.783" offset="807915">The respondent unions do not represent any of the officers or crews on the ships.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_ogden_jr" startTime="293.532" stopTime="1071.130">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Ogden, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="293.532" offset="1250847">That was done with local labor, that’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.460" offset="1262550">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.753" offset="1279791">But if I understood your question Mr. Chief Justice, the point is that there was no question, this case of the crew performing any labor on the shore side.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.181" offset="1357427">So the effect of the picketing was that an organized labor including a longshoreman and others, respected the picket lines and the unloading and loading of the cargoes could not be accomplished with the exception of the -- a fact that a slight concession was made to allow the trimming of the vessel so they could eventually depart from United States without accomplishing either the loading or the unloading of their cargoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.102" offset="1481143">This concession was made after the court action had been commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.688" offset="1503504">It was a part of the court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.581" offset="1523043">The picket signs read as follows, “Attention to the public, the wages and benefits paid to seamen aboard the vessel SS Theomana are substandard to those of American seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.961" offset="1576542">This was also an extreme damage to our wage standards and loss of our jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.942" offset="1592529">Please do not patronize this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.360" offset="1602142">Help the American seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.944" offset="1608516">We have no dispute with any other vessel on this site.”</text>
            <text syncTime="386.988" offset="1624712">In the picketing of the other ship of course, the other ship’s name was substituted in the picketing signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.319" offset="1654073">The unions also passed out leaflets at the dockside.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.734" offset="1675703">But the pickets had been instructed not to answer any questions which might have been asked to them as to the purpose of the picketing but merely to carry the picket signs and to pass out the leaflets.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.916" offset="1724395">The leaflets are printed on page 6 of our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.896" offset="1752294">In any case, the Texas Court found that the picketing was directed to allegedly substandard wages paid to foreign seamen with a concurrent request to the public not to patronize foreign ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.186" offset="1821466">The picket -- the background of the picketing was that it was planned at a joint meeting of American seamen’s unions where in it was determined to conduct a campaign, a peaceful picketing against foreign flagship.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.740" offset="1891683">The picketing in this which is involved in this particular case was related to other contemporaneous picketing of foreign ships in Houston and in other ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.987" offset="1960647">For example, we brought to the court’s attention in a supplemental brief filed just after our brief in support of a petition for certiorari, a reference to the Alabama State decision of Mobile Steamship Association which was a case which evolved out of the same picketing and this is what -- the picketing which was taking place in Alabama at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.245" offset="2097737">There are other ships picketed in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.759" offset="2163775">In summary form, the principal point of our argument is that this Court has already determined in its previous decisions that the Act does not apply to labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.301" offset="2229917">Between United States unions and foreign ships which relate to the maritime operations or it's sometimes called it to the internal affairs, anyway what people are talking about is the wages and conditions of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.744" offset="2295745">These decisions culminated in the Ariadne case which dealt specifically with picketing to protest substandard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.444" offset="2342557">And which set out the test of what determines whether the Act is or is not applicable when such a dispute takes place between an American union and a foreign ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.466" offset="2410580">The critical inquiry is whether or not the activities of the particular employees whose wage levels are being protested are or are not within the maritime operations of the foreign ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.879" offset="2484245">A significant element of these previous decisions of this Court which I will refer to in -- more detail in a moment, where the foreign relations, implications of any holding that the National Labor Relations Act was intended to govern disputes involving the internal affairs of foreign ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.045" offset="2608901">The foreign relations and the domestic economic implications of this particular case in the context of what it was a wide boycott of many, many ships completely out shadow any implications that would have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.368" offset="2714227">In the Benz case for example, or in the Incres case in which picketing which involved a single ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.693" offset="2751530">Here we had unions picketing all foreign ships which they could reach and claiming that the federal labor laws in effect give them a protected right to use picketing to bar such ships from our shores unless the foreign ships pay their crews at wage levels which are the same as American wage levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.823" offset="2904085">I think the -- certainly the foreign implications of this are quite staggering if you look at it at the point of view of the foreign maritime countries who will be interested in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.365" offset="2994260">Going to the cases which this Court has decided the first case, was the 1957 case of Benz.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.425" offset="3046400">I think all of the cases have really gone back to the initial Benz decision and to the reasoning in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.298" offset="3097913">Benz involved picketing of American ship by various seamen’s unions and the dispute which is cited on the wages of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.207" offset="3137620">The unions in that case were picketing to try and induce the foreign ship owners to reemploy the members of the crew at wage levels which were higher than those which had been provided for in the ships articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.396" offset="3198328">The court in Benz stated that the question to be decided was whether the labor Act applies to a controversy involving damages resulting from the picketing of a foreign ship operated entirely by foreign seamen under foreign articles while the vessel is temporarily in an American port.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.561" offset="3275024">The court held that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.376" offset="3294250">The union's argument that the case was the -- the jurisdiction of the state court was preempted, was rejected in Benz fundamentally because the court said that they found no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended the National Labor Relations Act to apply to disputes between nationals of foreign countries, operating ships under foreign laws and noted that the whole background of the National Labor Relations Act is concerned with industrial disputes between American employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.808" offset="3487974">For us to run interference in such a delicate field of international relations, held the court, there must be present an affirmative intention of Congress clearly expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.155" offset="3533322">It alone has the facilities necessary to make fairly such an important policy decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.708" offset="3575536">It's interesting and we pointed this out in our main brief that in the Benz case, the unions expressed the same long term goals as have been argued are the basis of the picketing in this case, namely that they were trying to protect the jobs of American seamen by their picketing activities in Benz.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.246" offset="3701760">The court -- I think the Benz case shows that the fact that the goals of an American union which are -- the fact that they are domestic goals does not mean that a dispute which centers on the wages of a foreign crews of a vessel are governed by the Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.906" offset="3812415">In other words, the goals of the union are not to be confused with the subject matter of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.757" offset="3871765">The next case was the McCulloch case in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.596" offset="3899141">That case involved whether or not the NLRB was empowered by the Labor Act to conduct an election on board of foreign ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.739" offset="3959745">The specific question that the court said was to be decided was stated to be whether the act as written was intended to have any application to foreign registered vessels employing alien seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.648" offset="4007288">And the court concluded in accordance with the Benz decision and I think it just followed the Benz decision -- it followed from the Benz decision that the jurisdictional provisions of the act do not extend to the maritime operations of foreign flagships employing alien seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.687" offset="4083461">The third case was the Incres case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.967" offset="4100598">Incres, as Benz again involve picketing of a foreign ship by an American union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.618" offset="4127242">And that the same question was involved, namely, whether the state courts were preempted from adjudicating a petition for relief filed by this shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.743" offset="4171755">In the Incres case, the union which was doing the picketing had been organized primary -- had been formed primarily to organized foreign seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.121" offset="4217208">And the picketing in that case was part of their campaign to try and organize the foreign seamen on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.295" offset="4253884">Again, as in Benz and as in the case at bar, the unions claimed in Incres that their goals were protection of the job opportunities of American seamen against the competition which lower costs of foreign flagships bring.</text>
