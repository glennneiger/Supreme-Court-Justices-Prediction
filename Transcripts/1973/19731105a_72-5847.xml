            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments first this morning in number 72-5847 Alexander against Gardner-Denver Company.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Spiegelman</label>
            <text syncTime="29.772" offset="195814">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.897" offset="208353">My name is Paul Spiegelman and I am counsel for petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.845" offset="228101">The questions presented today are we believe two.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.628" offset="243252">First, does the submission of a grievance to arbitration pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement deprive the Federal Courts of power to hear a statutory claim of racial discrimination based on the same incident which gave rise to the grievance?</text>
            <text syncTime="55.839" offset="300095">Second, under what circumstances if any is it appropriate for a Federal Court to refuse to hear a claim of racial discrimination on its merits because the person raising the claim has pursued a contractual remedy which arose out of the same incident?</text>
            <text syncTime="71.741" offset="363729">Petitioner is a black man who was hired by respondent in May of 1966, he bid on and was awarded a drill trainee job in June of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.559" offset="403017">He remained in that job until he was discharged on September 29th, 1969 allegedly because he accumulated excessive scrap.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.782" offset="439902">Petitioner filed a grievance on October 1st 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.648" offset="455367">That grievance stated, “I feel that I have been unjustly discharged and asked that I would be reinstated with full seniority in pay.”</text>
            <text syncTime="101.263" offset="481802">That was the entire grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.518" offset="486818">No mention was made of issue of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.169" offset="501447">The grievance was apparently brought under Section 6 (a) of Article 23 of the collective bargaining agreement which provided that no employee will be discharged, suspended, or given written notice except for just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.042" offset="560901">The contract also contains an ant-discrimination clause which provides that the Company and the Union agreed that there shall no discrimination against any employee on a account of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.387" offset="614296">Article 23 of the collective bargaining agreement sets forth the procedures for handling grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.979" offset="636656">Essentially, it sets up a five-step procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.793" offset="647941">The first four steps involve a negotiation between the Company and the Union and that failing to resolve the issue with fifth step of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.436" offset="682527">Arbitration may be invoked by the Union by written notice if the first four steps failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.748" offset="703739">The collective bargaining agreement has no provision whatsoever to the individual to force arbitration and there is no provision specifically indicating than anyone can withdraw a grievance from arbitration once it has been refered to arbitration by the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.854" offset="764134">They only mention of any withdrawal or implication of withdrawal is Section 6 (f) of Article 23 which provides that company may convert a discharge into a suspension if the Union agrees at anytime prior to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.313" offset="829962">The procedures also provide that, the failure to meet the time limits prescribed therein will automatically make the disciplinary action take valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.225" offset="869669">Those are the exact words of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.103" offset="897149">The agreement further provides that the Union and the Company select the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.198" offset="917525">No provision is made for participation of the employee and the selection of the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.867" offset="940199">The employee is not under the agreement even technically a party to the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.385" offset="970292">The arbitrator’s power is described in Section 5 step 5, it provides, the arbitrator shall not amend, take away, add to or change any of the provisions of this agreement and that the arbitrator’s decision must be based solely upon interpretation of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.407" offset="1038420">In this case, the Company denied petitioner’s grievance in the first four steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.832" offset="1060049">Prior to the grievance being referred to arbitration, the petitioner filed the charge of racial discrimination with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and some two weeks prior to the actual arbitration hearing, the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission assumed jurisdiction of his charge on depositions which are part of the record in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.865" offset="1352202">I would say that what the record does state is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.160" offset="1365368">First, petitioner indicated the only indication of it is from the deposition of petitioner which --</text>

            <text syncTime="329.902" offset="1396402">Yes, the statement of petitioner and that seems to be what the record contains on this issue, two things, one he indicated that a letter that he had written to the Union was read verbatim into the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.501" offset="1450736">That letter stated that and I am quoting, “I am knowledgeable than in the same plant others have scrapped an equal amount and sometimes in excess but by all logical reasoning I, Harrell Alexander, have been the target of preferential discriminatory treatment.”</text>

            <text syncTime="642.911" offset="2648398">I believe that our argument is that whether or not the issue is raised that arbitration should not prevent the right to sue in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.780" offset="2703882">Now, the District Court’s decision in this case relying on the sole ground that petitioner’s pursuit of his contractual remedies to arbitration barred his action under Title VII and the Court purported to rely on Dewey versus Reynolds Metals which has been before this Court and it was affirmed by an equally divided Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.053" offset="2780996">The Dewey rationale is that the submission of a grievance to arbitration prior to submitting the grievance to -- submitting the claim to EEOC constitutes an election against the Title VII process.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.182" offset="2853512">The Court of Appeals affirmed in the memorandum opinion which essentially relied on the District Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.434" offset="2886531">Now, we believe that as an initial matter, it’s clear that the Federal Court have plenary power over charges of racial discrimination regardless of the arbitration process.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.211" offset="2925610">Thus, if the court -- the Federal Courts are to refrain from hearing the case, it is not because of their lack of jurisdiction but because of some other reason made by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.975" offset="2984647">Now, the theory apparently offered under Dewey and that which apparently District Court relies on is a theory of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.968" offset="3024666">I submit that in this case and in all cases thus far where grievances have been filed, it is not proper to talk in terms of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.275" offset="3069806">First, let’s take the facts to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.660" offset="3079419">Petitioner manifested a direct intent not to waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.499" offset="3090704">He filed charges with the appropriate federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.289" offset="3101884">He informed the arbitrator that he had filed those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.725" offset="3115677">He informed the arbitrator that he thought his representation in this case was inadequate and surely did everything he could to follow his federal rights to talk in terms of an expressed waiver in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.963" offset="3160607">I do not think it would be problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.866" offset="3168235">Now, can we have an implied waiver in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="775.683" offset="3179520">Again, I do not think that would be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.321" offset="3185998">We are talking about a fundamental civil right here and we are talking about a layman making a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.567" offset="3207001">And I do not think that it is the custom to imply waivers of such important rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.355" offset="3242214">I would add then in the circumstances of grievance proceedings in general, we not only have the facts that the layman is making a decision but he is making it under a very, very short time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.015" offset="3288816">That is, he will under this very contract in this case he will automatically make the discriminatory discharge valid if he fails to grievance in this contract it’s in five days.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.065" offset="3361019">And if so, do you think that could be attributed to the employer, the consequences of ineffective assistance or is that an action, is that a proceeding against the Union?</text>

            <text syncTime="833.193" offset="3409502">Well, no I do not think that the issue was necessarily ineffective assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.593" offset="3431131">The labor law makes it quite clear that the Union has a wide variety of actions it can take.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.761" offset="3459762">It must merely not acting in bad faith in terms of its duty of fair representation under the labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.618" offset="3483272">It must not be arbitrary or in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.089" offset="3493094">Now, the Union and the arbitration process is one that contemplates that in fact the Union doesn’t hire lawyers for these arbitration processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.174" offset="3521411">Very often, the arbitration is conducted by a Union arbitration man who has had no legal training.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.616" offset="3543249">So the process itself is one that I point out is designed for the benefit of the employer as well as the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.829" offset="3572088">The employer regardless of the outcome of any grievance gets labor piece by a no strike clause which is the quid pro quo for his arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.264" offset="3609809">So that no matter what happens in the grievance whether the employer wins or loses, he’s already got what he bargained for and that is that the Union will not strike over this issue and he can enjoin such a strike under Boys Market if the Union does strike over such an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.208" offset="3669577">So the employer gets what he bargains for the minute a case goes to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.974" offset="3696640">Now, for these reasons we think the waiver theory is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.452" offset="3722553">The other theory advanced by courts and not relied upon but the District Court in this case was the theory of deferral.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.177" offset="3749407">The deferral theory is that the arbitrator has adequately dealt with the issues and it will save judicial time and energy not to deal with these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.148" offset="3785352">We point out that the Civil Rights Act embodies a fundamental commitment on the part of this country to end racial discrimination and that mere judicial economy is not an overriding consideration as against this important policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.443" offset="3846478">Nonetheless we believe that deferral to the arbitrator’s award is not an appropriate way even in terms of judicial economy to deal with important civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.922" offset="3908441">Now, in doing this I want state very clearly that we do not mean to denigrate the arbitration process as an efficient way of dealing with normal labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.653" offset="3947311">The arbitration process is well embodied in the labor law and is working efficiently to deal with fast, speedy, efficient relief of particular law of the Charlotte (ph) kind of questions which are characteristically raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.489" offset="4010736">We do believe however that there are things about the arbitration process in racial cases which make it inappropriate to use it as a method for -- as a process to which to defer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.328" offset="4738090">Yes, I think that even respondent in this cases indicated that the that regardless of what the Federal Court’s rule is the employee would be able to file charges, that’s at least respondent’s position even he lost the arbitration that is the EEOC would process its claim and the EEOC could in fact go forward in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.480" offset="4814681">So even under that circumstance it would not prevent the case from getting to EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.346" offset="4830145">The question is whether these claims in fact would come to court, will lawyers take these claims?</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.801" offset="4855954">If they are doubtful, I doubt that they will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.453" offset="4862537">It’s tough enough to get a lawyer to handle a civil rights case that is meritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.357" offset="4894198">It seems unlikely that these individual claims will in fact be those that are largely burdened in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.618" offset="4923246">Now, I would say that there are overriding considerations here though.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.645" offset="4939337">And those are that the process of arbitration owes its existence to a collective bargaining agreement which itself may violate Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.688" offset="4979461">If for the Union representative, there has a built in conflict of interest because the Union itself may be liable on these very charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.631" offset="5023242">This creates also problems because the employer in the Union not the individual choose the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.032" offset="5044872">You must remember that the Union’s interest acting in good faith still involved of the variety of trade offers and choices which it must make and it is representing the majority members of that Union under the labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.014" offset="5096803">And perfectly good faith decisions of the Union may in fact disadvantage the Title VII plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.762" offset="5135778">Now, I would finally add that the arbitration process is simply not equipped to deal with the subtle issues of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.325" offset="5162005">This Court recently in McDonnell Douglas had occasion to deal with the difficult questions that arise in proving even an individual case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.740" offset="5207667">For example, the Court indicated that statistical data is relevant to determining such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.741" offset="5231700">Now, without a discovery process and it's normal that there is not a discovery process, there is no opportunity to bring this kind of evidence before the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.632" offset="5267226">Also, there is no cross-examination in the arbitration process and having tried a number of Title VII cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.792" offset="5291886">The fact is that the cross-examination of the company witnesses is one of the key basis for proving the case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.499" offset="5326785">For these reasons, we believe that deferral is not appropriate for Title VII case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.859" offset="5364193">It was also point out that on the record in this case the arbitrator did not decide the race issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.137" offset="5389270">He did not say anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.711" offset="5395644">He specifically said there was no evidence dealing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.503" offset="5406720">So, I think that deferral is in any case improper in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.165" offset="5425424">There is also the issue of the effect of deferral on -- of allowing deferral on the grievance process itself will discourage people from using the grievance process and in fact channel all these claims into Federal Court because people are afraid of getting an arbitrator who is not sensitive to these claims rather than Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.736" offset="5511732">For these reasons, we think that the decision below was improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.904" offset="5732415">Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.040" offset="5756865">In the spring of 1971 when this issue was before the Court in Dewey against Reynolds Metals Company, Solicitor General Griswold, Assistant Attorney General Leonard and General Counsel Ed Baire (ph) of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a brief and the Government participated in the oral argument of that case resulted in a 4:4 division in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.764" offset="5863758">That involved an additional troublesome issue not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.010" offset="5896777">Now, with new encumbrance at all three of those offices, the government undertook a complete restudy of this question in light of the experience gained in case is decided since that time and in light of the scholarly commentary which has been published on the Dewey case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.996" offset="6008686">Practically, all that I must -- I should add critical of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in Dewey and the conclusions we have reached in the briefs filed with the Court in the present case are the same in all respects as the position, the Government took in the Dewey case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.336" offset="6098129">Because of the widespread availability of grievance procedures pointed out by Mr. Justice Stewart under collective bargaining agreements, the question presented in this case seems to us of great public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.223" offset="6157688">Its answer may well determine whether the statutory rights against discrimination conferred by Congress in Title VII as interpreted by the courts and by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission whether those rights will be widely observed and even handedly enforced or whether those rights will in substantial measure be superseded by the so called law of the shop which is implemented by arbitrators who interpreted and applied the terms of various private collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.045" offset="6324976">Now, the position we take on this issue is the position that has been taken by a majority of the Courts of Appeals that have addressed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.052" offset="6372937">The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits have all held that the invocation of the arbitration process of the grievance process and its use does not bar suit under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.227" offset="6433646">This is proved to be workable in those Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.817" offset="6452036">They are not inundated with a large number of lawsuits seeking in other form to re-litigate so called the questions that have been decided in the arbitration process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.659" offset="6519432">Indeed, the same question could be raised about some of the duplications of remedies that Congress specifically provided for Title VII, where it said that the remedies available again to millions of employees, I don’t have the figures, before state and local fair employment practices commissions should be preserved but should not bar the Federal remedy if they prove on availing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.074" offset="6657045">This is the approach that Congress used and indeed our starting point in this case is the Federal statute itself which confers of right of individual access to the Courts for its enforcement and specifies in detail, the prerequisites for that right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.317" offset="6741995">Nowhere does the statute suggest that the right to a judicial determination is waived by the availability or by the use of the grievance procedure under a collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.245" offset="6801763">The whole background of the legislative history was that Congress meant to preserve existing remedies such as remedies that might exist before the National Labor Relations Board which were specifically referred to in the legislative history and remedies in other forms and to add to those the newly created rights and remedies specifically provided for.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.216" offset="10117642">Merely upon his firing he and the Union invoked the four steps grievance and arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.965" offset="10144601">Early in those steps he submitted to the Union his letter which impart accused the company of discrimination treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4736.705" offset="19023517">If Alexander i.e. David has two cracks at my client i.e. Goliath, there’s nothing wrong with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4862.695" offset="19527576">I’d like to first deal with the question of voluntariness which is the cornerstone of the respondent’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.243" offset="19553698">We have a case here where the choice of arbitration was made by Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.555" offset="19570939">There is nothing in the record to indicate for one instance that petitioner had any right to withdraw that grievance once the Union went ahead with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.257" offset="19601763">The point made by counsel here that EEOC advice plaintiff with respect to his rights here is contrary of the facts, the EEOC told me had a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.341" offset="19634155">They issued him a right to sue at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.864" offset="19640216">Moreover, as a matter of fact when a man files a charge with EEOC, it gets put in the file and it maybe six or eight months before he ever hears anybody on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.212" offset="19673548">So the notion that EEOC provided many assistance in this case is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.857" offset="19692147">Now, I think that we must deal with the issues of why should there be deferral policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.018" offset="19712836">There have been a number of question arguments made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.144" offset="19733316">The government has told us that the labor act is ill-served by a policy of the deferral and I can tell you there’s a private lawyer if you have deferral problem, I will advise every one of my clients not to use the grievance machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.223" offset="19785665">The Federal Courts will if anything be inundated by a deferral of rule because all the clients are going to take their case to the Federal Courts where they have much more adequate proceedings.</text>
