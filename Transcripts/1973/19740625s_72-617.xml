            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.846" offset="113142">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.962" offset="141667">It involves a libel action by a reputable attorney against a magazine that’s falsely libeled him of Leninist and a communist fronter.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.302" offset="187016">The district court denying recovery, held that the subject of the magazine article was a matter of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.830" offset="221080">The court therefore applied the strict standard of New York Times against Sullivan, a case decided here in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.226" offset="258696">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.761" offset="268831">In the New York Times case, this Court held for the first time that where a public official was a plaintiff in a libel case, it was necessary for him to prove knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.928" offset="345527">The New York Times standard subsequently was extended to apply it to public figures as well as public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.099" offset="386173">The rationale of this line of cases is grounded of course in the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.012" offset="413863">We decline today to extend New York Times to a case where neither a public official nor a public figure is a plaintiff, merely because the publication is thought to be a matter of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.475" offset="483662">We recognize the state’s interest in protecting the reputation of private individuals must be balanced against the First Amendment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.424" offset="531519">Accordingly we hold that the states may allow compensatory damages, for libel which causes injury to the reputation of private individuals without applying the strict New York Times test.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.151" offset="602363">But we would not approve the imposition of liability without fault as we think this would unduly burden a free press.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.328" offset="639039">Thus with regard to libel suits by private individuals, the states will be free to apply any standard which does not impose liability without fault, such as of negligence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.462" offset="699643">Accordingly we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.260" offset="726810">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.165" offset="742484">The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice White each has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
