            <label>Mr. Marvin M. Karpatkin</label>
            <text syncTime="14.176" offset="133433">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.905" offset="160392">This case is here on certiorari for review of the Ninth Circuit’s denial of post conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255 to petitioner Joseph Anthony Davis, who was convicted of refusal of induction into the Armed Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.037" offset="224862">It is conceded that he was ordered to report as a delinquent without a prior physical examination, and a statement of acceptability as the Selective Service regulations required for all persons not delinquents.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.078" offset="277107">It is likewise conceded that he was declared delinquent by his local board because it unilaterally determined that he did not comply with the prior order to report for a physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.515" offset="322769">And it is also conceded that, but for his delinquency status, he could not have been ordered to report for induction without the prior pre-induction physical examination, and the statement of acceptability issued at least 21 days before the induction date.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.269" offset="385776">His conviction was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit not withstanding and argument made on direct appeal that his delinquency induction order was invalid under the doctrine established by this Court in Gutknecht against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.102" offset="437185">While petitioner’s case was pending before this Court on certiorari, a change in the law occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.231" offset="461636">The Ninth Circuit decided United States against Fox, a case concededly identical to that of Davis, holding what the Gutknecht Doctrine required the invalidation of delinquency based induction orders when the order to report without a prior physical examination and statement of acceptability was based upon a declaration of delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.586" offset="543138">Post conviction relief was sought on the basis of this intervening Fox decision and denied by the District Court and the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.253" offset="577724">Thus, there are two principle questions, may it please the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.499" offset="594756">The first is whether post conviction relief under 2255 is available when there has been an intervening change in the law to the 2255 petitioner’s benefit and a case concededly identical to petitioner’s case on the facts and on the law which was decided after appellate affirmance of petitioner’s conviction and while a prior petition for certiorari was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.918" offset="696424">Based on, I respectfully submit some unexplained and inexplicable motion of law of the case which is totally erroneous, the Ninth Circuit held per curiam that there was no basis for 2255 relief because petitioner’s claim had been advanced albeit unsuccessfully in the absence of the new law on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.853" offset="772180">Indeed, the change in the law occurred four months after the direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.646" offset="791301">The Government has apparently confessed error, either in whole or in part on this point, but our view is against post conviction relief for other reasons which we respectfully submit are equally without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.212" offset="833620">The second question, of course and perhaps the fundamental question is whether the intervening new law decision in United States against Fox which invalidated a species of delinquency sanction which was not before this Court in Gutknecht, the sanction of induction without a prior pre induction physical examination, and the statement of acceptability was a proper interpretation by the Fox court of this Court’s decision in Gutknecht and also this Court’s decision in Oestereich.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.873" offset="956291">Gutknecht and Oestereich as would be recalled of course invalidated somewhat more dramatic species of delinquency sanctions than that involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.439" offset="994534">Now, the Government admits that Davis, this case, and Fox are utterly inconsistent which the Ninth Circuit again astonishingly refused --</text>

            <text syncTime="246.986" offset="1064647">Wouldn’t we just remand to have them get to the issue they thought should be reassessed?</text>

            <text syncTime="252.183" offset="1085440">That is certainly a possible solution Mr. Justice White, but I respectfully suggest that since that if Fox is the law and if Fox is correct, that a remand would be an unnecessary waste of judicial time on the part of the Ninth Circuit, and perhaps I even fear to think on the part of this Court, because this case has been in the Ninth Circuit on three occasions and these very arguments were brought to the attention of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.523" offset="1210828">And when we were previously here on certiorari, indeed, we suggested that this Court might wish to remand to the Ninth Court with the suggestion for reconsideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.594" offset="1319079">If I may represent to the Court as a member of the bar of the Ninth Circuit, I have been informed by United States Attorneys in the Ninth Circuit that it is the uniform prosecutorial practice to act as the Fox is law.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.348" offset="1362129">Indeed, the United States Attorney told me that Fox is considered the son of Gutknecht.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.606" offset="1951138">And we submit that that is an alternative ground on which the decision below must be reversed, but we would hope that it would be reversed on Fox and Batiste grounds rather than on Dobie grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.113" offset="2017176">There are various decisions of District Courts, but I’m not aware of any other circuit dealing with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.800" offset="2048000">Of course, the underlying question by the -- presented by this case is the scope and the legal significance of the constitutional holding of this Court in Gutknecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.623" offset="2095229">I believe that it is apparent from the reading of the Gutknecht decision that the essential holding is that Congress never vested the authority to induct as delinquents in either the President or the Selective Service system, and that any such standard was delegation would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.026" offset="2192823">Now, as I noted before, the case has been to the Ninth Circuit three times into this Court twice, consequently, it has a somewhat elongated history which we try to set forth and explicate in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.962" offset="2240575">But the essence, the essential facts which provided the basic legal posture of the case is that the local board in the effect accused petitioner of failing without reasonable excuse I assume to appear at the physical examination, that it warned him that he might be delinquent, and that in that warning stated that he would be denied various rights under the law and subject to induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.438" offset="2362514">And shortly thereafter, it declared him a delinquent and notified him that he had been declared a delinquent by reason of his failure to appear for the physical examination, and also by reason of his failure to keep the board informed of his current address.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.069" offset="2412983">As we set forth in the record in the briefs, many of these notices which petitioner was charged was not receiving and was being delinquent on the basis of were not received by him or according, there was no record that they where ever receive by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.450" offset="2462511">Needless to say, the determination that he committed these infractions if indeed, he committed him was made unilaterally by the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.089" offset="4209058">But even that Gutknecht to seem is a non constitutional holding, we have of course first, 2255, the statute itself which has constitution or laws, and we have the absence of any decision by this Court which states other than in dicta that 2255 is only available in the constitutional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.009" offset="4304771">And then I respectfully suggest, we have a perhaps common sense argument if I may advance it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.876" offset="4332251">There are certain types of rights which it seems to me that even though they have not been in ensconced with a constitutional category by this Court are so fundamental that their denial would have to be the basis for 2255 relief, and take for example, if someone is denied the right to an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.541" offset="4410932">Now, this Court had said on many occasions that it is not clear whether there was constitutional right to an appeal, but of course, there’s a statutory right to an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.330" offset="4442070">And surely, someone who through some mischance was denied a right to an appeal and as some prisoner sent in a writ three years after he had been denied the right to appeal based on 2255, I doubt if he could be properly be denied the hearing on whether he was improperly denied as right to an appeal which is non-constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.146" offset="4513332">If I may just pursue the constitutional point one minute more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.714" offset="4543634">The Government says that there is no reference to any provision of the constitution in the Gutknecht case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.216" offset="4565577">But Gutknecht relies on Kent against Dulles, and Kent against Dulles turn cites the famous Youngstown against Sawyer case, and also perhaps even more famous in somewhat older, Panama Refining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.183" offset="4625450">And both of these cases obviously stand for the proposition that where there is an absence of law, where there is an absence of authority, then it is beyond constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.439" offset="4666514">And if one needs to put one’s finger on a Constitutional Clause, I respectfully suggest to my learned brother that the Constitutional Clause is Article I, Section 1.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.849" offset="4784170">But I think, to argue that Gutknecht is not a constitutional holding is to argue that Panama Refining and Youngstown are not constitutional holdings, and I submit such an argument is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.992" offset="4824712">If there’s anymore fundamental argument than a violation of the constitution because of the violation of a constitutional provision, it is acting in the absence of constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.791" offset="4883958">Now, of course, there is also Fifth Amendment procedural due process questions which the Government at various points in its briefs seems to partially concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.328" offset="4918021">Now, the fact that Gutknecht and Fox must be retroactively applied, I respectfully submit is another reason why Section 2255 relief is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.295" offset="4961907">Of course, the retroactivity argument which the Government vigorously argues against our position assumes that Fox is correct, otherwise, we wouldn’t be here talking about retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.433" offset="5002449">Indeed, we wouldn’t even be here talking about 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.245" offset="5017704">Now of course, first, Fox is already been held retroactive by the very circuit which decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.587" offset="5043096">Second, Gutknecht has been retroactively applied universally and we cite all the cases on page 46 of our brief, I would particularly and respectfully invite the Court’s attention to the very careful analysis of retroactivity of Gutknecht by Chief Judges of that in United States against Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.177" offset="5117492">Moreover, there is no need, there is no occasion to engage in the pragmatic Linkletter/Stovall type analysis which the Government urges upon us, because this is not a case which seeks to determine the retroactivity of procedural rules which bind the contact -- which govern the conduct of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.536" offset="5206936">Like Robinson against Neil, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist points out in the opinion for the Court, this case is similar to a valid claim of double jeopardy, because if Fox is correct, then there will not be any fact-finding burden, and there will not be any further trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.890" offset="5276317">There would be no question of the integrity of the fact-finding process because the fact-finding process is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.079" offset="5313097">Finally, the ends of justice will be served by granting post-conviction relief and we are reminded in Kaufman and in Sanders and another decisions that that must always be borne in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.553" offset="5354998">I first may say that the problems which have been raised by Justices of this Court and by distinguished scholars, some of which are referred to in Mr. Justice Powell’s concurring opinion in Schneckloth against Bustamonte are not simply, not available in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.326" offset="5418005">There was no problem here of any deliberate bypass of other available remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.263" offset="5433783">Petitioner has been knocking at every conceivable judicial gate looking for a remedy these past years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.094" offset="5461159">Furthermore, it’s obviously no delicate question of federal state relations, and as I stated before and as I think should be stressed it is no question here of a guilty person going free because of some exclusionary rule or some similar prophylactic device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.976" offset="5520614">If Fox is correct and Mr. Justice Powell, if I may again respond to your prior question, the Ninth Circuit in Fox indicated that they weren’t very happy about his Selective Services to (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.212" offset="5565544">But if Fox is correct, then the induction order is invalid and the indictment just must be dismissed because the crime of induction refusal has just not been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.844" offset="5612147">Now, the Government at one point notes the various scholarly criticism of 2255, but then at another point states that even if Fox is right and even if this is a meritorious claim, then nevertheless should not be 2255 relief because of the Government’s own conception of how narrow it should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.244" offset="6053721">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.171" offset="6073469">The Government in this case has three independently sufficient reasons that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.473" offset="6110668">It is a rhetorical difficulty with our posture that in order to argue any one point, we must for purposes of argument concede the validity of petitioner’s position on the other two points, and then my brother has been able to find a cumulatively, we concede our entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.959" offset="6196558">Our three points are that the subject matter of this claim is not cognizable under Section 2255 proceeding, brought and after the judgment of conviction has become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.713" offset="6251624">That in any event, the conviction of the District Court was proper and that if it was not proper and the rule of United States against Fox is correct, that rule should not be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.804" offset="6315990">In our brief, we argue the merits of the conviction first for purposes of exposition, however, logically, this Court must reach the jurisdictional issue under 2255 before it would reach the merits and therefore I will address the 2255 question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.896" offset="6400313">This is a question of considerable importance on which even a casual reading of the many Court of Appeals opinion dealing with 2255 will reveal a need for this Court’s attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.416" offset="6454439">For instance, Zack against Benson in the Ninth Circuit on which petitioner relies as a holding on all points of the Court with his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.100" offset="6497176">In that case, the Ninth Circuit was not aware that there was a 2255 issue to be addressed before relief should be automatically granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.748" offset="6551719">I have discussed our position in this case with a number of members of the bar of some experienced who -- although finding our position persuasive, have expressed some surprise in saying that although they hadn’t really thought about it, they always understood that the federal system was a double trial, double appeal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.687" offset="6635520">You went in first, your conviction an appeal, and then you had a second bite at the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.561" offset="6663001">Now as I think, we have argued in our brief and on the basis of the authorities in our brief, it’s clear the 2255 plays a very narrow role in the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.740" offset="6735726">The reasons, the policy reasons for this narrow scope of collateral attack after a criminal judgment becomes final are I think important ones in bear repetition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.957" offset="6788598">First of all is the importance of finality for the function of a criminal law itself, the functions of rehabilitation and deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.928" offset="6824438">A criminal law cannot rehabilitate if the convicted defender is constantly faced with the uncertainty about whether he’s conviction is really valid and whether if he just didn’t raise one more claim, he would in fact discover that he had been wrongly and unjustly convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2105.002" offset="8496797">To that, we do not rely upon the theory and the reason is that we feel that here or there has been a vigorous and effective effort to pursue all remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.623" offset="8555207">And that the fact that remedies were pursued in direct appeal should not result in their denial in collateral attack if they are available that this petitioner should not be in the worst position than a petitioner who had not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.041" offset="8612885">In fact, he should be in the better position because he has responsibly pursued his remedies, and he is quite correct when he says he is in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.616" offset="8647262">We don’t think he should be penalized for failing to responsibly pursue his remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.087" offset="8661055">Now, there’s a separate issue, a related issue in the habeas corpus tradition about when the failure to pursue remedies available on direct appeal, results in a denial of the right to the writ and of course in Sunal against Large in the opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas, the Court said that the failure to appeal there resulted in denial of the availability of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.539" offset="8754887">That issue is not before us and the extent to which that bypass of remedies has to be conscious knowing or reach the level of waiver is a separate issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.965" offset="8808594">There may be cases where the failure to pursue a remedy will of itself deny habeas corpus relief, collateral attack relief without regard to the nature of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.336" offset="8854047">But where the relief has been pursued on direct appeal, I don’t think we can responsibly say that petitioner has somehow lost his collateral remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.217" offset="8925623">Now, the history of habeas corpus has been canvased in the opinions of this Court in the literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.229" offset="8953626">It’s limited some of its scope as always been emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.898" offset="8988317">And we rely upon those precedents in that history and there is not as far as we’re aware precedent in this Court where habeas corpus has issued for a non-consti -- for a claim which do not relate to the denial of non-constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.296" offset="9065953">I’d like to turn now and discuss our view of the questions to whether the conviction was proper and petitioner’s arguments on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.700" offset="9111510">In our view, the Gutknecht decision is simply not in point, insofar as this case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.180" offset="9141499">As we read Gutknecht, it held that the delinquency regulations were not -- could not be used by the Selective Service system to punish registrants for failure to comply with the violations of the regulations that the punitive scheme of the statute is a criminal scheme and that the enforcement through the criminal law is the exclusive means for extracting compliance with the regulations promulgated by the Selective Service system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.613" offset="9303249">And in the Gutknecht case of course, the record clearly showed an application of just such a punitive use of a delinquency regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.318" offset="9342015">As soon as the petitioner in Gutknecht had -- where the defendant in Gutknecht had sent his draft card into the draft board, he was declared delinquent and immediately ordered to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.741" offset="9403664">Now, the record here is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.960" offset="9416620">The record here shows that between the initial notice to report for physical examination and the final second order of induction, there was a long and patient effort by this draft board to locate and obtain from the registrant fundamental substantial compliance with his obligations under the Selective Service system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.162" offset="9525394">When he failed to appear for his first physical examination, he wrote to the board, explained that he had been ill and the board responded simply by ordering him for another physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.198" offset="9585580">And just as he was about to be declared a delinquent after having failed to appear twice, he appeared again and gave a new address, and the board then did not, having him prosecuted for failing to appear for physical, the board merely sent him an order to that address to appear for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.418" offset="9682442">Due to this patience and the record is ambiguous as to whether this was a young man who is confused about his obligations or a young man who is attempting to evade his obligations and that’s I think counts for the patience of the board, by the time the induction order came about, he was behind others in the same age category who had complied with their obligations under the statute and have been ordered for induction and were inducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.571" offset="9811069">So he benefited from the difficulties he had from the Selective Services to whatever the reasons that they occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.616" offset="9847223">Now, the delinquency regulations as they remain after Gutknecht continue to serve other purposes than those held bad in Gutknecht and enable the Selective Services system simply to keep track of the compliance status of registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.211" offset="9929561">They enable the service to notify registrants of compliance difficulties and they reflect I think together with the amendment to the regulation of 1970 to simply provide for induction orders without medical examinations, a policy of minimum criminalization that is if young man can be induced to report for induction, even though they did not report for medical examination there is not an effort to escalate the sanction and to make everyone who does not appear for medical examination an immediate subject of a prosecution under the criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.009" offset="10124748">In the face of this argument, position to petitioner is that since under the regulation, you had to be declared delinquent to be inducted without a medical examination, he lost his right to a pre-induction medical examination and this right conferred by the regulations is of such a substance that it required that he not be convicted and that it be available in collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.855" offset="10220147">In his reply brief to our position in the petition for certiorari, petitioner suggested his real theory was that there was a statutory right relying upon the Castillo opinion to our pre-induction physical, that argument he has now abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.563" offset="10299037">If there is any technical error in the processing of this induction order as a result of the complexities of the fallout of Gutknecht in the time in the fact that this induction order was issued before the Selective Service opinion, the system had the advantage of the Gutknecht opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.366" offset="10382211">We argue that error is entirely technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.024" offset="10392869">It is harmless error and would not be available in any case at the original trial as a defense and therefore also, the conviction was proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.051" offset="12053002">Yes, he did and that is provided for in the Armed Forces regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.564" offset="12079020">On retroactivity, again, the Court in Zack against Benson on which petitioner relies, it seems to upheld the rule of retroactivity but without stating there is an issue present in the case, and I don’t think that petitioner urges that we are now foreclosed from having review of the retroactivity of the Ninth Circuit rule once this case is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.692" offset="12187481">But we do feel the issue is the retroactivity of Fox and not the retroactivity of Gutknecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.447" offset="12210573">Of course, if this petitioner contends the rules are precisely the same, there’s just no meaningful distinction between the cases, then this point has no separate merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.999" offset="12260728">But we think the rules are quite distinguishable and we think that the analysis of retroactivity requires that the Court look at the possible purposes for the Fox rule an issue on which the opinion of the Ninth Circuit is not very expansive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.965" offset="12328647">But as far as we really make out, the rule does have the effect of just saving the courts from the kind of collateral or factually inquiry that was made here on remand, the examination of the delivery list and that kind of inquiry a court might well feel is not really essential to the systems since induction can be accomplished through amendment of the regulations without delinquency declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.105" offset="12461140">And that purpose, it seems to me is achieved by perspective application and the fact that the courts are called upon to examine for acceleration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.666" offset="12507429">In fact in those few cases where induction orders occurred before the Gutknecht opinion is not such a burden on the courts is to require retroactivity application of the Fox rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.301" offset="12753920">That in Peet on the basis of Gutknecht, the conviction was vacated and remanded for re-sentencing since there was a two-count conviction in that case, and Peet had been declared delinquent for non-appearance at a physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.585" offset="12807105">But of course, there was no written opinion, but a vacation of a judgment of a Court of Appeals, I always understood, is action on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.006" offset="12840751">Now, it is our basic contention that there are three species of delinquency sanctions which were created in the delinquency regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.625" offset="12887249">And that each and all of them are equally invalid because equally without congressional authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.024" offset="12916820">Congress did not authorize delinquency induction without a physical examination, and without a statement of acceptability, anymore than it authorized punitive reclassification as in the case of Oestereich, or accelerated induction as in the case of Gutknecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.742" offset="12983693">The offense to the basic constitutional right that is involved is not so much the facts of any particular case or the nature of sanction, but the offense is the existence of this delinquency power because it implies an extra penal sanction, the sanction of induction under extraordinary conditions for asserted wrongdoings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.084" offset="13085048">Now, perhaps, Congress has this power under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.596" offset="13099154">The Solicitor General speculates at Note 17 of his brief as to whether Congress might have the power to induct draft card burnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.681" offset="13127471">But the fact is that Congress has not sought to exercise that power, to either give it to the President or to the Selective Service system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.706" offset="13163624">And I submit that in the words of Oestereich and Gutknecht, what we have here is sheer administrative lawlessness, blatantly lawless conduct on the part of the executive authority creating this power and bestowing it by executive order to the administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.013" offset="13236767">Now, insofar as prejudice is concerned, the petitioner Davis was prejudiced because he was inducted without this congressional authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.680" offset="13271458">He’s prejudice was as great as someone who is prejudiced by being tried and convicted before a judge without jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.619" offset="13303223">Or perhaps more to the point for an act, however, it might be considered reprehensible which is not been declared a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.498" offset="13334779">It seems to me that the effect of Gutknecht is as in United States against United States Claim and Currency is to declare that persons who have failed to report for induction following the declaration of delinquency are constitutionally immune from punishment, and that any acts which they may have committed may be susceptible to other kinds of criminal enforcement, but not susceptible to this kind of criminal enforcement because it has never been authorized by the only body under Article I, Section 1 which has the power to authorized punishment, the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.870" offset="13472183">Consequently, I don’t think that there is any point to getting into a discussion as to whether Davis and other similarly situated are prejudiced by not having the 21-day statement of acceptability and the time to seek to obtain review by not having two physical examinations rather than one, and by not having all of the rights to seek additional deferments and exemptions which as this Court knows from the Evett case are automatically cutoff upon the issuance of an induction order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.780" offset="13591824">Now, some reference has have been made to New Section 1631.7 in the colloquy between Mr. Justice Stewart and the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.841" offset="13628082">We respectfully submit that the New Section 1631.7 which presumably allows induction upon a finding of refusal without the use of the badge word delinquency does not cure the problem and was not the basis of the Ninth Circuit decision in Fox.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.913" offset="13708434">We would respectfully refer to the Court the opinion of Chief Judge Cancio in United States against Castillo in the District of Puerto Rico which is cited in our brief, but I do not believe the decision has yet been reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.372" offset="13750230">And Judge Cancio points out that a rose is a rose is a rose, and that a local board that making a unilateral due process less determination that someone refused to attend the physical without using the word delinquency is just as much offending the Gutknecht principle as a local board that does it with the utilization of the badge word delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.509" offset="13838733">Insofar as concern Zach against Benson, I don’t know whether the Ninth Circuit was aware or was not aware of what the Solicitor General thinks that should have been aware, but I do know what was said to the Ninth Circuit and the briefs which will presented before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.793" offset="13883873">And the first line of the argument points out that this is a Section 2255 case, and the Ninth Circuit is fully aware of the fact in Zach against Benson, the brief of which I just read from that it was 2255 case and that was before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.575" offset="13935073">Of course, it does not preclude this Court, but it certainly shows that view taken by the one panel in the Ninth Circuit which has ruled on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.099" offset="13965166">Finally, the Government speaks of the purposes of deterrence and rehabilitation of Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.095" offset="14001110">The purposes of the deterrence it seems to me are completely satisfied by the existence of the alternative sanction, of prosecution and conviction for failure to report for a physical examination which carries the same five-year, $10,000.00 maximum penalty as refusal of induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.585" offset="14075089">And insofar as concerns the purpose of rehabilitation, I wonder what rehabilitative purpose is served by allowing two men in exactly the same situation to be in the status of one being free and the other being under criminal conviction and possibly in jail.</text>
