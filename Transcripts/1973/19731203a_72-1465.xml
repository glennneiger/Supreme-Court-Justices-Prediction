            <label>Mr. W. Eric Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="154.721" offset="695589">Your Honor, on this action under 42 U.S.C 1983, the Federal Civil Rights Act was brought as a class action by two California prison inmates, a Mr. Martinez, who has since escaped and is still at large, and to Mr. Earle (ph) who is the representative of the class of all California inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.610" offset="799138">It’s originally alleged four class or general actions and one claimed for individual relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.858" offset="836232">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281, three-judge federal panel, considered the general causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.779" offset="879909">One of these causes involved registered mail and by a voluntary action on the part of the Director of the Correctional System, who was then and still is in the process of revising these various regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.410" offset="958380">This aspect of the postal system was made available to inmates and that mooted the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.985" offset="988682">There was a second cause that involved confidential mail from inmates to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.142" offset="1033300">This too, was mooted by the action of the California Supreme Court which in, In re 7, I beg your pardon, in, In re Jordan which is cited in the brief interpreted California Penal Code Section 2600 to find such a California statutory right in the inmates that supported federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.924" offset="1152418">The third individual claim was brought by Mr. Martinez and this ultimately was mooted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.504" offset="1186795">So, we are then left with two general causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.939" offset="1208529">The first was an attacked on the First and Fourteenth Amendment on four California Correctional Regulations having to do directly or indirectly with the inmates’ mail, inmates personal or inmates’ social mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.552" offset="1287001">And the second cause was an attack under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment on access to the courts, insofar as California controlled confidential interviews between inmates and their attorneys and assistance too.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.602" offset="1371115">All these regulations by the decisions of the three-judge Federal Court where found to be undeclared, unconstitutional insofar as they applied to mail or restricted access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.762" offset="1447811">Their enforcement was enjoined and we appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.257" offset="1473724">In addition, the Director was ordered to submit new regulations in accordance with the finding of facts and the conclusions of law of the District Court, thus substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.869" offset="1524193">And the new regulations were ultimately approved on August 1, 1973, and they are now in effect in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.120" offset="2837211">Now, in the cases I’ve seen we do have a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.606" offset="2847138">It’s California Penal Code 2600 and it is cited in our brief of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.892" offset="2880366">But I’d like to read this one little Section which is follows, “Pursuant to the provision of this section, prison authorities shall have the authority to exclude obscene publications or writings, and mail containing information where, how, and from which such matter may be obtained, and any matter of a character tending to incite murder, arson, riot, violent racism, or any other form of violence, and any matter concerning gambling or a lottery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="735.952" offset="3020591">Now, this we say is the limit of the California authority to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.642" offset="3083285">In, In re Harrell at 2 Cal. 3d 675, the California Supreme Court held that this statute, the one I just cited was in fact the California Inmates Bill of Rights and that the concept to civil death had been abandoned in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.408" offset="3182341">We submit, it could be fairly argued and fairly interpreted, although, I’d be frank with you, it will be my duty as representing the Director to argue to the contrary in the appropriate state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.192" offset="3241482">But nevertheless, it would be fair to argue that the only exclusion authority of the California Director is contained in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.642" offset="3291324">Now, as opposed to this in their brief, appellee’s argue that because a -- California set those Section 1419 specifically and for the first time put end to Section 2600, the right of inmates to send social mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.837" offset="3388082">That therefore, there is no right statutorily in those inmates to send social mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.662" offset="3427370">This may well be but we point out that in that same bill which incidentally, never became law, but in that same bill there was an amendment which provided that the California authority, the California Correctional Authority showed for the first time have specific authority to excluded writings on the grounds they would tend to incite and I quote, “disobedience of prison rules.”</text>
            <text syncTime="872.701" offset="3567595">Therefore, we can argue on parity with the appellees that absence such specific authority there is no authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.914" offset="3616392">In short, we feel that the California Supreme Court could fairly and easily and contrary to the position that we would take in that court, hold there was indeed a California statutory right in inmates, and that like the Director only had the power to exclude those matters specifically referred to in California Penal Code 2600.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.109" offset="4145215">Your Honor, I’d like to address myself to this substantive questions and that involves the actual regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.809" offset="4183980">Now, the forums involved the mail and they are very brief as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.241" offset="4209685">Rule 1205 are all in the briefs that are before you and this had to do, I beg your pardon Your Honor -- with 1205 which had to do with contraband and that is the any writings and I’ll admit some things which are inflammatory expressing inflammatory political, racial, religious or other beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.075" offset="4389094">And also is subsection (f) of that same rule which includes writings which in the judgment of the warden or superintendent might tend to subvert prison order and discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.605" offset="4443220">In addition, there is an actual mail regulation which is -- was also attack which said that the inmate might not send or receive letters that pertain to criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.120" offset="4497241">This too, also contained this phrase “that are lewd, obscene, or defamatory and contain prison gossip or discussion of other inmates” and this aspect too is attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.893" offset="4572369">And finally, inmate behavior, which prohibited or attempted to deter those who agitate, unduly complain, magnify grievances, or behave in any way which might lead to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.708" offset="4647602">It is about these regulations that we are talking today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.751" offset="4675709">Now, we do concede and agree that certain specific federal constitutional rights do indeed follow an inmate inside the prison involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.350" offset="4746136">These include for example, the right of access to the courts, the right now to suffer cruel and unusual punishment, and indeed perhaps the right to exercise religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.979" offset="4824712">But we ask this question and that is, “Do the First Amendment rights, as we popularly understand them, that is the right communicate and receive ideas and to assemble for the purposes of doing so, does these rights follow the inmate within the prison environment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.442" offset="4922514">Our first position is that these do not and we say was the Fifth Circuit rule in the Frye v. Henderson, again it’s cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.623" offset="4967236">That social mail is not a federal constitutional right but is a matter of prison administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.536" offset="5022929">Now, we say this realizing that in that event there can be no federal burden upon us to justify the regulations if there is no underlying federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.854" offset="5120209">And we say because, we believe that the underpinning of those First Amendment rights does not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.088" offset="5221146">As we understand it, the basic underpinning of these rights on which I think it’s Judge Learned Hand said, “if we stake our all in the proposition that in the free society, it is best to expose people to a free market place of ideas and our fundamental belief is that from this clash of beliefs good, bad, and indifferent from this exposure, that ultimately long term such a free society will only choose, or will choose ultimately beliefs which will improve in our wellness, increase or enlightenment and protect the very freedoms that permit them to choose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.776" offset="5443814">Put another way, perhaps we might say that the highest aspect of social wisdom is the long-term collective judgment to free people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.491" offset="7302687">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.774" offset="7319824">The state has argued that the District Court should have abstained in this case on one issue only that of mail censorship rules but there is no basis on which that issue could be decided on state law grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.267" offset="7381786">There is no uncertainty whatever about the whether these rules apply to prisoners in California, they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.288" offset="7413864">There is no uncertainty about whether they apply to all letters from prisoners to their family or friends, they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.976" offset="7444689">And there is no uncertainty that these rules are designed to give the censoring guards absolute open-ended unchecked censorship power as to their contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.202" offset="7489515">These rules were authoritatively construed by Director Procunier in his testimony and deposition in this case to permit the censoring guard to fill in the blank to find a reason that he would think would be appropriate for rejecting any particular letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.202" offset="7557538">Director Procunier testified that that was permissible under the rules involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.522" offset="7582824">Now under California law, under Section 5058 of the California Penal Code, the Director has complete unreviewable authority to make and change rules and regulations for the administration of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.002" offset="7644787">There is no restriction on that, no state statute limits his discretion in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.049" offset="7668924">Therefore, there is no state law basis for deciding the issue of mail censorship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.831" offset="9108062">If a person is sentence to imprisonment in California, all of his civil rights are thereby suspended and he has none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.127" offset="9141290">That’s what the statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.526" offset="9150903">And then in the third paragraph the statute states that this section shall not be construed so as to deprive such person of the following civil rights and then four specific civil rights are listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.508" offset="9214746">And the fourth one, is the right to purchase, receive, and read any and in all newspapers, periodicals, and books accepted by the post office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.600" offset="9263125">Then, there's a qualification on that right giving prison authorities the power to exclude obscene publications or writings and this is the first mention of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.057" offset="9312967">And mail containing information concerning where, how, or from whom such matter referring to obscene publications and writings may be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.241" offset="9357688">Now, the statute, thus, takes away all civil rights except for specific ones and this mention of mail is only a qualification an exception to an exception if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.868" offset="9416202">And it just doesn’t confer a general right in the prisoner not to have his mail censored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.374" offset="9442220">Even if the statute were applicable, even if the structure of the statute were not as it is, the statute deals only with incoming matter and not at all with outgoing matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.998" offset="9492689">It gives the prison officials the right to exclude certain things from the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.708" offset="9511602">But it doesn’t deal with things that are going out and the issues in this case involve what the prisoners are writing outside of the prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="2376.726" offset="9583700">Therefore, even if the statute could be interpreted the way the Deputy Attorney General would have it read, it could only apply to a very small part of this case and would not significantly alter the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.781" offset="9639915">The Supreme Court of California in the Harold decision mention by counsel for appellant, did interpret this subsection of the statute, that Court reads the statute the same way we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.232" offset="9693727">In short, the issue of mail censorship could only be decided on federal constitutional grounds and there’s no basis for sending the prisoners into the state court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.283" offset="9741897">Turning to the substantive issue on mail censorship, it’s essential to focus on exactly what the District Court did and what it didn’t do.</text>
