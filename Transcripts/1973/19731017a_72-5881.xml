            <label>Mr. James F. Hewitt</label>
            <text syncTime="9.792" offset="115879">Thanks, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.250" offset="121731">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.933" offset="136464">As we were discussing yesterday it was our position as the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia held in Hamilton that the two prior felony exclusion operates in effect as a conclusive presumption of an eligibility and that the rational connection between two prior felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.793" offset="203964">With no delineation as to the type of conviction, the time of conviction or other circumstances in effect would deprive an applicant who would be otherwise eligible for commitment under the present provisions of Title II from an opportunity to have consideration and a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.534" offset="266867">Now, this Court last term in the food stamp cases, the Department of Agriculture versus Moreno in effect struck down a provision similar to that which operated as a conclusive presumption thereby preventing a fair hearing of the merits, a person’s eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.859" offset="332173">I would submit to you Your Honors that that would be basically the same problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.939" offset="348473">This in effect fetters the hand of the trial judge and prevents him from an opportunity to fairly evaluate whether or not the particular addict should be sent to prison for addict treatment or whether he should be sent as a straight offender and subject to whatever rehabilitative treatment might be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.483" offset="414720">We feel that the trial judge’s hand should be unfettered.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.428" offset="426423">That this constitutional -- this Congressional classification is in effect an irrational one and defeats the legislative purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.022" offset="476787">It would appear to us that the addict in this particular case, Mr. Marshall did have in effect almost a fundamental right to consideration for fair and effective treatment of his addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.303" offset="537913">As we pointed out yesterday, we’re not talking about --</text>

            <text syncTime="117.977" offset="548676">Mr. Hewitt excuse me, do you have to go that far or is it enough for the purposes of your case to say that he had a right to put in evidence on the subject to trigger the district judges’ discretion in the matter?</text>

            <text syncTime="143.165" offset="649404">But he certainly had a right to have the judge consider that and in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion determine that this is the type of addict who was likely to be rehabilitated and who may have treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.541" offset="694962">The problem here is that the judge couldn’t do this under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.010" offset="708754">He was barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.277" offset="713874">He was in effect prevented from even an opportunity of considering this man’s background.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.415" offset="734459">Now, it may well be that the Congress has decided to keep hiding criminals out of Title II, but the judge can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.318" offset="766015">He can do that by just simply not exercising his sound discretion and committing him under Title II of the Narcotics Act.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="179.682" offset="795481">Does the power of Congress to fix the jurisdiction of Federal Courts constitute any kind of a barrier here to what you’re driving at?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_f_hewitt" startTime="190.695" stopTime="290.327">
            <label>Mr. James F. Hewitt</label>
            <text syncTime="190.695" offset="839576">I think certainly Congress could limit the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts and provide that no addict could be committed for treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.291" offset="865907">But where it has created a class and a class to which Mr. Marshall is a member and then excluded him from the class on the basis of an irrational classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.553" offset="898926">It was our position that he has been deprived the due process by virtue of denial of equal protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.546" offset="926929">I would have to concede that Congress doesn’t have to give addict treatment to addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.699" offset="947513">It can limit the course of jurisdiction in the area of consideration but it certainly cannot prevent, Marshall the petitioner here, from consideration on the basis of this irrational classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.482" offset="990668">Now, the Government seeks to justify this by the expedient explanation of possible subsidiary purpose in the legislation to conserve economic resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.817" offset="1032046">They could’ve made that argument in the Department of Agriculture Food stamp cases that they wanted to limit the number of people eligible for food stamps to save money and thereby justify the classification but it wouldn’t be any more justified in that particular case than it would be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.952" offset="1088575">Most of the legislative history that the government has cited relates to some apprehensions that Congress had in connection with expanding the existing public health facilities for the Title I, the prosecution in lieu of the Commitment in Law of Prosecution provision for Title III of the voluntary commitment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.010" offset="1160777">It would appear from the examination of the legislative history that the Bureau of Prisons was not too concerned with any drain upon their resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.978" offset="1188676">They have the prisons, the person who is going to go to prison, it's the question of whether or not he’s going to go and get addict treatment or whether he’s going to go and in effect be deprived of addict treatment or get it only at the whim of the Bureau of Prisons.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="290.327" stopTime="319.305">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="290.327" offset="1238100">Did I understand that you seem to concede the power of Congress to have a distinction which permits the segregation of what you called hardened criminals amendments two, three, four convictions from first offenders who are narcotics addicts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_f_hewitt" startTime="319.305" stopTime="402.664">
            <label>Mr. James F. Hewitt</label>
            <text syncTime="319.305" offset="1353979">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.137" offset="1357322">I think they do if they have a test that -- that is fair and certainly a test that is not based upon a conclusive presumption of being a hardened criminal simply by virtue of two prior felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.717" offset="1419598">What we object to is the fact that these two prior felonies could have been 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.350" offset="1438198">They could have been for the most innocuous of offenses and to say that a person is a hardened criminal because 30 years ago he was convicted of theft of mail or forgery of a treasury check to relatively innocuous felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.748" offset="1495771">To say that he is a hardened criminal and therefore he is not eligible to treatment in prison as an addict, I think is just certainly irrational and this is our objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.041" offset="1532865">If there are standards applied to the barring provision reasonably related to the purpose of the legislation, perhaps our position would not be quite so strong but I feel here that what we had basically is a recognition that narcotic addiction is the root cause of a good deal of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.912" offset="1596395">There is an effort on the part of Congress to treat addicts by giving them treatment in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.219" offset="1613636">And then to say that these objectives will be fulfilled by barring from that very treatment those with criminal records is an irrational conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.409" offset="1658358">In fact, it’s almost absurd and that is certainly our position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.705" offset="1675598">Thank you, Your honor.</text>

          <turn speaker="jewel_s_lafontant" startTime="412.213" stopTime="826.056">
            <label>Ms. Jewel S. Lafontant</label>
            <text syncTime="412.213" offset="1725649">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.938" offset="1752503">In the statement of facts yesterday, petitioner remarked that there was no gun involved in the robbery of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.324" offset="1814047">I do want to bring out, however, that when petitioner entered this bank, he presented a note to a teller who happened to be a moonlighting police officer and that note said I have a gun, I don’t want to hurt anyone just hand over the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.603" offset="1907148">Petitioner also states that that crime was reduced from a crime of violence because certainly robbery of the bank is a crime of violence and it was reduced to larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.186" offset="1965453">Had it not been reduced to larceny, he would have been excluded from the provisions of Title I and Title II as having been found guilty of a crime of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.187" offset="2021460">Petitioner contends that the provisions of Title II of the Act which excludes persons with two prior felony convictions from its benefits is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.967" offset="2108604">In his brief, he compares Title III with Title II complaining that a person like himself, a possessor of a two felony conviction record cannot trade his felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.687" offset="2167536">His third felony conviction for commitment under Title II while a person with three or more felony convictions, in fact any number of felony convictions maybe committed under Title III as long as he has completed all of his prior sentences of conviction and as long as there’s no pending criminal charge against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.276" offset="2269832">Petitioner argues this classification is arbitrary and unreasonable and has no rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.265" offset="2313822">If we look at the Act, we can say just from a mere cursory reading of it that the purpose is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.700" offset="2359589">This isn’t a case where we have to go to the congressional record, review the hearings, review what all the representatives said although it’s very interesting reading to interpret the Act’s meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.603" offset="2427193">The Act is unambiguous and is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.031" offset="2440882">It provides for the treatment and rehabilitation of narcotic addicts and in addition provides in Title I and Title II, the commitment for treatment in lieu of penal incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.537" offset="2494903">The Act is three-pronged.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.883" offset="2500232">The Title I provides for civil commitment in lieu of trial for certain consenting narcotic addicts charged with Federal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.707" offset="2539624">Title II, the one that we’re concerned with today provides for a similar civil commitment in lieu of penal incarceration for narcotic addicts who have already been convicted of a Federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.431" offset="2602423">And Title III provides for civil commitment at the instance of the addict himself or at the instance of the related individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.436" offset="2658534">And it’s clear from Title III that Congress did not wish to foreclose the multiple offender from treatment for his addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.473" offset="2694687">Because under Title III, no person is excluded except the person who has a pending charge against him or who hasn’t completed his sentences under prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.641" offset="2747350">In other words, a multiple offender can be committed under Title III, to a hospital for treatment for his addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.945" offset="2784549">But we must recognized that Title III -- that Title III addict doesn’t present any new menace to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.122" offset="2825195">The prison under Title III is a person who is free in the community already having paid his debt to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.037" offset="2856856">And when he seeks treatment as an addict, he’s not entering to escape a pending charge or any future punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.029" offset="2896875">He sincerely is seeking physical and psychological therapy voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.476" offset="2922684">Petitioner makes much to do over the fact that a third person can have himself committed under Title III and the fact that the third person can bring him in makes this less than a voluntary act.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.255" offset="2993737">But whether or not the request for treatment under Article III is voluntary is really not too important.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.854" offset="3020173">The important item is that the addict is already in the community and in seeking help is removing himself from free intercourse with society for hospital treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.808" offset="3068029">Petitioner asserts that treatment for an ill person should be guaranteed and that he would like it to be a fundamental right and that the State should provide treatment for all these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.273" offset="3157891">In Powell versus Texas, Mr. Justice Marshall stated that and I quote, “This Court has never held that anything requires that penal sanctions be designed solely to achieve therapeutic or rehabilitative effects”.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.582" offset="3235109">But we’re not even arguing here, the petitioner should not receive treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.153" offset="3253394">We do maintain that he has no basic right to trade treatment for commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.928" offset="3292473">Petitioner would have us believe that in denying him benefits under Title II that he’s denied all types of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.260" offset="3337822">This is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.121" offset="3345241">He’s only being denied the privilege of trading that commitment under Title II for penal incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.173" offset="3373453">I’m advised by the Bureau of Prisons --</text>

            <text syncTime="842.884" offset="3448268">Yes indeed and that’s a very good point that you’re raising Mr. Justice Rehnquist because I am addressing myself to that even later in the argument but the answer to it is definitely, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.457" offset="3514619">I’m advised by the Bureau of Prisons that all addicts in the Federal Prisons are eligible for treatment and do receive treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.290" offset="3557878">And the only thing that limits the kind of treatment they get is the lack of resources and sometimes the lack of motivation of the offender himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.428" offset="3598420">But in all of our Federal institutions we have rehabilitative program set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.197" offset="3621512">At this time, we have 14 intensified medical programs and by the end of the fiscal year, we expect 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.806" offset="3659964">However, there is a difference which you have addressed yourself to Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the people committed under NARA are treated somewhat differently from the non-NARA addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.062" offset="3729032">The NARA addicts are put into intensified treatment immediately and they are released on an average within 17 months back to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.683" offset="3783471">Many of them are released within six months of the time they enter the treatment but on the average I’m informed it is 17 months and then they are released into the community with intensive follow-up care.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.862" offset="3844180">In response to the inquiry of the Chief Justice, as to whether or not non-NARA addicts are foreclosed from treatment in Federal penitentiaries, the answer is definitely “No”.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.750" offset="3907709">We do have rehabilitative treatment in the jails for persons who are serving regular Federal Prison terms and who happen to be in addition, addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.454" offset="3962567">They all receive some treatment upon commitment, if no more than when they first get there they are dried out within three days to three weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.249" offset="3997780">In fact ,the physiological desire for narcotics has been gotten rid of within three months to six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.234" offset="4037695">So, they do receive that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.895" offset="7684284">And they have found that the first offender fairs better than the repeater on both counts as an addict and as a criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.838" offset="7748127">Yes, as our brief points out, I think more than half of our argument is devoted to the fact that this was a pilot program initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.607" offset="7799223">This is the first major Act in this area that has been taken since 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.530" offset="7826913">It was recognized that very few people really know much about addiction and the problems and the cures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.355" offset="7862126">It was the beginning program, a pilot program they wanted something to be done but at the same time they knew that not only because of lack of resources but because of lack of knowledge, they weren’t willing to open it up to the whole addict public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.746" offset="7923775">They had to start somewhere and in starting somewhere they had to draw classifications also, and this certainly would be a reasonable classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.530" offset="7974870">Since 1966, many institutions have been built and it has included more and more people even now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.965" offset="8020637">They’ve gone further than just say the hard addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.237" offset="8033698">They treat people who are on barbiturates and pediments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.755" offset="8059820">But you’re perfectly right, Mr. Chief Justice that it was a pilot program and the line had to be drawn somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.604" offset="8091167">We respectfully submit that drawing the line at this point was perfectly reasonable and that the Court of Appeals’ opinion should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.399" offset="8154384">If I may respond to some of the Solicitor General’s suggestions, the references in the legislative history to pilot an experimental, I think were aimed directly, for the most part, at Titles I and III.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.327" offset="8206106">The concept of having civil commitment in lieu of prosecutions or a voluntary commitment for addicts was a new concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.424" offset="8234423">We never had it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.307" offset="8241946">But during the legislative history they discussed the experiences in New York and California with this type of commitment and I certainly don’t think there’s anything new or anything novel or experimental about giving the best treatment that the prison system can to an addict who is imprisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.471" offset="8302655">I don’t think, certainly, we can say that this with any great well change.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.379" offset="8314253">Is it the fact Mr. Hewitt that if one is eligible, the chances of getting to the streets, if he comes within Title II are better than if he’s not noted in Title II?</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.649" offset="8395337">And this is the fallacy of the Government’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.540" offset="8406936">At the present time, the reason that the addicts are being released in approximately 18 months after they’re committed under Title II is that the only addicts in prison are checks towards male thieves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.096" offset="8445179">No one with any prior records there, no one with a crime of violence is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.076" offset="8461061">These are fairly moderate sentences that are being given. Probably five years or less since Title II provides that he cannot be sentenced in excess of the maximum that could be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.026" offset="8496901">We’re not talking about bank robbers or kidnappers or people who engaged in violent crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.231" offset="8621662">It depends upon his propensities other than addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.263" offset="8637753">I have found from my experience that the older addict with a longer criminal record is more amenable to rehabilitation than the young kid who is just getting started.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.490" offset="8786756">What I can assure you, Your Honors that addicts sentenced to federal prisons do not get treatment unless they are in a NARA program or unless they are one and one of the prisoners that has a program with openings, and there are only 12 of those I understand out of 28. And two, they are one year or 18 months away from parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.516" offset="8850808">Edward Marshall was sentenced by the district judge to 10 years parole at any time and a specific recommendation in the judgment that he would be given treatments for his addiction and he isn’t getting it, simply because of his prior felony record.</text>
