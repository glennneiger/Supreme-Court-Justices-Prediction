            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="113476">Yes, I will announce these opinions in the order in which the case were docketed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.943" offset="132493">The first one then will be 72-1660, the case Stanley Blackledge, Warden against Jimmy Seth Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.254" offset="193724">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.105" offset="221205">The respondent in this case was convicted in a North Carolina Court of Limited Jurisdiction upon a misdemeanor charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.897" offset="260284">He exercised his right to appeal and secure an automatic new trial in a higher state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.654" offset="287347">The state countered by bringing a felony charge against him in the higher court based upon the same conduct that had been the subject of the misdemeanor charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.001" offset="328725">He pleaded guilty and was given a longer prison sentence than had originally been imposed for the misdemeanor conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.935" offset="356519">A Federal District Court granted habeas corpus that its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.717" offset="391628">For the reasons set out in the written opinion filed today, we agree with the Court of Appeals that it was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment for the state to up the ante after the respondent appealed his original misdemeanor conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.670" offset="451396">Accordingly we affirm the judgment before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.437" offset="466547">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Powell also dissents upon one of the grounds relied upon by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
