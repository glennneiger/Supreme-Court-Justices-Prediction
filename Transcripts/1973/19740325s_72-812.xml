            <text syncTime="29.462" offset="194560">In the Storer and Frommhagen cases there is an appeal from a three-judge District Court judgment, holding various provisions of a California Election Code constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.202" offset="253597">The provisions in general regulate the access of independent candidates to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.396" offset="286302">Insofar as the Storer and Frommhagen are concerned, they were bared from the general election ballot by a provision of the code forbidding independent candidates from running as independents if they had been affiliated with a authorized political party within a specified time prior to the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.400" offset="386299">We agree with the District Court that, that provision is valid, but there are other parties to this litigation Messrs Halls and Tyner were barred from the ballot for failure to satisfy the signature requirements in the California Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.139" offset="457352">As to that part of the judgment we vacate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.504" offset="466756">We think that further proceedings necessary in the District Court, but in all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.950" offset="504581">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Douglas and Marshall have joined.</text>
