            <text syncTime="230.954" offset="1000594">That’s correct, Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.385" offset="1010312">The alleged conduct against the judges includes the following allegations: (a) the judges involved set bond in criminal cases by following an unofficial bond schedule without regard to the facts of the case or the circumstances of the individual defendant; (b) that they sentence black persons to longer criminal terms and imposed harsher conditions than they do with respect to white persons who are charged with the same or equivalent criminal conduct; and (c) that they require plaintiffs and members of the class to play for a trial by jury when charged with violations of city ordinances which carry fines and possible jail penalties if the fine cannot be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.368" offset="1190243">Though the amended complaint alleges in paragraph 36 (b) that O’Shea and Spomer sentenced black persons to longer terms and imposed harsher conditions than for white persons similarly charged, the complaint does not mention a single instance of such conduct in the past nor does it charge that any sentence were not within the judge’s lawful discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.402" offset="1286374">Indeed, no plaintiff has alleged to have been among those charged, bailed or sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.689" offset="1311556">Furthermore, no plaintiff has alleged to be threatened with the possibility of requiring bail or being sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.296" offset="1345933">The plaintiffs do not set forth any fact or allege a single instance of improper bail procedure or excessive sentence in the amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.156" offset="1385326">Moreover, no other allegation of plaintiffs’ complaint evidences or supports the conclusory allegations in the sixth claim for relief against the defendant judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.271" offset="1429838">The plaintiffs additionally, do not indicate any request for relief, either by habeas corpus or by appellate review which has been made by any member of there class or by anyone else for past judicial discrimination by either of the defendant judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.389" offset="1502354">The allegations regarding the setting of bonds and the payment for jury trails, do not state the respondents are treated differently than any other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.403" offset="1542374">It is merely averred in general terms that the petitioners follow an unofficial bond schedule in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.564" offset="1574975">No charge is made as has been done with respect to sentencing practices that there exists discrimination in treatment of white and black persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.022" offset="1612800">The sole issue was drawn by the pleadings relates only to the allegation of the judges’ discretionary role in imposing sentence on a lawfully convicted defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.596" offset="1655118">The complaint is completely barren of any factual averment involving the defendant judges and contains only one allegation of discrimination by the judges and that is relative to the sentencing practice and this allegation is alleged only on information and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.355" offset="1734217">The District Court dismissed the complaints on grounds: One, that it lack jurisdiction to entertain a clause seeking to have a Federal Court substitute its judgment for the judgment of the state judiciary; And two, that no regular performance of judicial officers’ duties, judicial immunity, barred relief in an action under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.147" offset="1829303">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in a two-to-one decision reversed the judgment of the District Court and ruled that a Federal Court may entertain actions requiring federal supervision and regulation by mandatory injunction over the discretion which state court judges may lawfully exercise within the limits of authority granted to them by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.282" offset="1929927">The Court of Appeals held, one, that the complaint stated a clause of action against these practitioners under the Civil Rights Act Sections 1891, 1981, excuse me, 1983 and perhaps under 1982; And two, the doctrine of judicial immunity did not extend to the defendant judges in the light of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 where injunctive relief is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.837" offset="2068062">The Seventh Circuit recognizing that this holding created a case of first impression volunteered guidelines which the Federal District Court might follow in imposing upon the state judges a system of reporting their conduct and the disposition of their cases in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.636" offset="2143295">We submit that the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals would permit the intimidation of state court judges and would deprive the state of an independent and intellectually free judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.572" offset="2198988">It is our contention that the common law doctrine of providing civil judicial meaning for judicial acts was not abolished by the congressional civil rights amendments, regardless of whether the damages are mandatory or mandatory damages are sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.288" offset="2277878">This Court established before in the classic case of Bradley versus Fisher which we cite very extensively in our brief, that the purpose of judicial immunity is to assure the independents of the judicial judgment by precluding personal jeopardy of the judges who might err.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.644" offset="2355304">We submit that the sanctions of the contempt are as dangerous to judicial independents as a risk of a suit for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.287" offset="2389891">One cannot visualize a more dramatic example of judicial subordination on the spectacle of having a state judge brought before a Federal District Court on the claim of injunction and put to the ignominity of having to sit on the witness stand, defend the integrity of his character and his actions and be subjected on cross-examination to the verbal onslaught of a class of people as in this particular instance who had never been before that particular judge at any time.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.253" offset="2749753">It would be a prohibitive act and not the constant supervision where the judge could be called in to be subjected to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.686" offset="2787474">While on that federal standards state judge could compelled to recall his past decisions and the reasoning behind those decisions. For the instance like the present case, the judge may not only be on trial with respect to an individual case, but for patterns and practices which comprised within their purview many decisions extending through a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.161" offset="2885381">The effect of decision of the Seventh Circuit Court will be to chill judicial discretion in disposition of the justice in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.878" offset="2924251">In effect then, a state judge will have to look over his shoulder each time he exercises his judicial discretion for fear that by some nebulous standard of statistical analysis, he has not meted out justice in accordance with the Federal District judge's personal formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.000" offset="2996767">In addition, a state judge would be more likely to quantify or balance sentences or amounts of bail not in accordance with what the circumstances are before him or what the circumstances would have warranted, but out of the nagging fear that leniency or strictness irrespective of whether deserved over a period of time would be interpreted as deliberate discriminatory conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.672" offset="3107422">Subjecting a state judge to federal review each time a dissatisfied, but lawfully committed defendant alleges class discrimination which would require federal judges to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether a pattern of discrimination existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.518" offset="3178789">A judge operating under an order not to discriminate in fixing bonds and sentences would find himself confronted with the possibility of a federal contempt citation and the necessity to defend his motivation in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.025" offset="3240856">The admonishment of this Court in the City of Greenwood versus Peacock would apply to this case equally as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.690" offset="3271471">But the burden of the federal system would be in the least cumbersome and severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.354" offset="3294145">The effect on the state system would be to create in the press of atmosphere of federal supervision and perhaps render it impotent.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.782" offset="3331866">The action countenance by the court below would result in the Federal Court sitting not only in review of state discretionary decisions, but also as the appellate tribunal passing ultimate judgment on state criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.610" offset="3391216">We hold this -- the action sanction here is civil that requires the review of past criminal decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.981" offset="3424653">In addition, the likelihood of a great similar class actions would be taken to the District Courts from state criminal actions on the ground that the judge will or has a propensity to discriminate against a particular group.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.342" offset="3490168">The result would be to exchange state remedies in favor of District Court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.503" offset="3514723">Extending the possibility of sanction by this court below to its most absurd result, a state court judge could literally spend so much time defending his actions in frivolous suits in the federal bar, that he could not perform his state judicial duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.884" offset="3576268">Again, an admonishment from the City of Peacock -- or City of Greenwood versus Peacock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.541" offset="3602913">It must be noted that the decision of the Courts of Appeal for the Seventh Circuit does not limit its holding to lower state court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.725" offset="3635618">Indeed, the application of the Seventh Circuit Court’s decision renders all state judges subject to injunctive relief should some class allege that they have engaged in patterns and practices which they feel violate their civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.778" offset="3703850">Therefore, this decision if it allowed to remain in effect could easily propel a rash of federal injunctive proceedings against state appellate Court based upon the naked allegation that the appellate justices or any combination of them engaged in patterns and practices of conduct inimical to the civil rights of the complaining class.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.758" offset="3799771">The unfitting bowl given to judicial immunity doctrine by the Seventh Circuit Court irrevocably alters the historic relationship that has existed between the courts of equity and the lower courts, between the Federal State -- Federal Courts and the state courts, and between the judge and those persons appearing before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.763" offset="3895798">The effect of permitting actions against the state judiciary going out of the exercise of lawful discretion would be too irreparably harm the administration of criminal justice at the state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.238" offset="3949714">We submit that no intellectually independent state judiciary could survive in an atmosphere of hostile litigants and the constant federal supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.047" offset="3996944">We believe that the question of judicial immunity had been of question of whether judicial immunity had been abolished by the Civil Rights Act was answered by this Court in Pierson versus Ray which we cite in our brief that this Court held that the common law immunity of judges from civil action for acts committed within their judicial discretion was so subtle a principle as to be accepted from the provisions of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.917" offset="4128392">Furthermore, this Court in Pierson considered the same legislative history which the court below held to be so incisive and found that history a warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.705" offset="4167576">So much so, that the case states that gives no clear indication that Congress meant to abolish wholesale, all common law immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.935" offset="4212506">Mr. Chief Justice Warren expressed the feelings of eight members of that court when he wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.730" offset="4235703">“We presume that Congress would have specifically so provide had it wished to abolish this doctrine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.734" offset="4267677">Nothing in the explicit language of Pierson affords a basis to limit that holding to money damages especially in the light of the Chief Justice compelling language which draws no distinction between monetary and equable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.430" offset="4330475">He said it at page 554, “It is a judges’ duty to decide all cases within his jurisdiction which are brought before him, including controversial cases which arouse the most intense feelings in litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.404" offset="4390348">His errors maybe corrected on appeal, but he should not have to feel that unsatisfied litigants may hound him with litigation charging him with malice or corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.607" offset="4439144">Imposing such a burden on judges would contribute not too principle and fearless decision making but to intimidation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.561" offset="4478955">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Court draws the narrow distinction that while judges are immune from damage suits, they maybe subjected to a mandatory injunction if ever anyone should charge them in the Federal Courts with class discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.828" offset="4544052">The defendant judges submit that no distinction can logically be made as to judicial immunity between damages and an injunctive order for a judge’s lawful exercise of his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.755" offset="4599745">The decision of the two-man majority in the court below is well-written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.388" offset="4618344">But we submit at a careful reading of the decisions cited by the Seventh Circuit wherein injunctive relief has been granted, would reveal that these cases either deal with ministerial duties exercised by a judicial office or the cases do not discuss the doctrine of judicial immunity or ex parte proceedings in which the accused judge didn’t participate are based upon the misapprehension of other decisions utilized as precedents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.142" offset="14217300">We also submit that the allegations as have been charged here in a civil rights case that the holdings of the courts have been that in civil rights action the pleadings must be specific in the case People Ex Rel Holf versus Ballinger (ph) is such a case that hold that these pleadings be specific.</text>
