            <text syncTime="42.707" offset="247536">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.167" offset="265404">In a large number of cases, this Court has recognized the limited role that Courts of Appeals have in reviewing the scope of remedial orders of administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.568" offset="322978">The standard governing such review has been formulated in different ways, but there the Court had said it before the appellate court attempts to change the remedy, it must find that the remedy selected has no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found that it constitute a patent abuse of discretion albeit the agency has not made an allowable choose of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.329" offset="422034">Now this principle has also been applied to orders of the National Labor Relations Board, this Court having recently stated in Gissel case that those orders are entitled to special respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.475" offset="470622">All of those cases have been ones in which the remedy provided by the agency has been challenge because it assertedly went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.354" offset="506149">The agency did something more either that was permitted to do under to the statute or that was claimed as necessary to deal with the problem before the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.563" offset="547004">In this case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the National Labor Relations Board had failed to go as far as it should have gone in providing appropriate remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.591" offset="603115">Specifically, because the Board failed to grant a Union request that in addition to a number of other remedies that the Board had provided, it did not require the employer to reimburse the Union for counsel fees expended and extraordinary organizational expenses it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.417" offset="694439">In connection with an organizing drive result where the employer had committed serious unfair labor practices against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.079" offset="741042">We have brought the case to this Court because we think that the standard governing the proper scope of judicial review of agency orders should be the same and must be the same whether the order is challenged as excessive or inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.519" offset="810841">And indeed, as I understand the Union has no disagreement with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.005" offset="824738">The Union said, “Yes, the standard is the same, but under standard the Board acted improperly.”</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="193.405" offset="850338">Mr. Friedman, you don’t need to respond immediately to my question but there is a question in here about the status, if any, of the employer Heck's in this case that you know there is a motion to strike their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.091" offset="917107">So they were not allowed to intervene and then after we denied certiorari, they were allowed to intervene in the Court of Appeals and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.492" offset="942707">I hope before this argument is finished, there will be some little straightening on this.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.992" offset="968725">Let me -- I think it will be a convenient point to address it right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.591" offset="983144">Heck’s was a party of course before the Board and all of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.929" offset="1004460">On the cases before the Court of Appeals the first time, Heck’s intervened that it has a right as it had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.805" offset="1031941">When the case came back to the Court of Appeals, the second time Heck’s did not intervene although it had a right to do so, and a case was presented to the Court of Appeals on the assumption by the both the Board and the Union that the Board had this authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.016" offset="1088784">Heck’s could have intervened but didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.895" offset="1096307">The Court of Appeals apparently assumed the Board had this authority but held that the Board have failed to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.640" offset="1119295">It was only after the Court of Appeals had remanded the case to the Board to provide these remedies that Heck’s then sought to intervene before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.156" offset="1161404">That was denied by the court presumably as untimely because under the rules and application for intervention it's required to file within 30 days of filing a petition to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.321" offset="1202051">Heck’s then sought review in this Court on a petition for certiorari but denial of intervention.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="287.251" offset="1225770">Denial of intervention, that was denied, that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.349" offset="1246145">Following that, Heck’s was permitted to intervene by the Court of Appeals approximately six weeks after the petition for certiorari which was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.413" offset="1282403">Now, we have filed a supplemental memorandum in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.951" offset="1296509">It’s a Xerox document that we were unable to file unfortunately until last Friday in which we discussed this problem at considerable length.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.332" offset="1330051">We say, suggest to the Court is first of all, we think it is very dubious; whether after this Court has granted the petition for certiorari, the Court of Appeals can then grant intervention so as to permit someone to become a party in the proceeding to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.526" offset="1390864">We think when this Court has taken the case that at least ousts the Court of Appeals of authority to make then someone a party.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.040" offset="3584940">Heck’s as is customarily for it, strongly resisted the Union and engaged in a variety of unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.292" offset="3617959">I use the word “customarily” because Heck’s is not stranger to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.282" offset="3645858">In the past few years, it has been a respondent in 11 different proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.888" offset="3664248">And the Board found in this case that this was part of a general plan by Heck’s, conducted by its two principle officers, it's president and vice president to resist unionization at every stage and it is said to deny its employees their rights under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.154" offset="3745332">What the Heck’s did is to cause customarily ring to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.452" offset="3762573">They threatened and coerced employees who were active in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.284" offset="3785874">They conducted a non-secret poll of the employees as to who is interested in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.205" offset="3805518">They threatened that if the Union got in, they’d close the store and then they refused to bargain with the Union, even though as the Board found the Union enjoyed a representation status with respect to a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.021" offset="3872810">The Union had obtained cards, authorization cards and that was basis on which it sought to bargain with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.261" offset="3901753">Now, this is of some significance with respect to the kind of case we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.649" offset="3923383">Heck’s asserted that it had a good faith doubt with respect to whether in fact the Union represented a majority of its employees and the examiner agreed with Heck’s on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.929" offset="3972493">The examiner said yes on all the facts we think Heck’s did have a good faith doubt, the Board however reject that.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.924" offset="4004467">As a remedy for these unfair labor practices, the Board adopted what is its conventional remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.272" offset="4025887">It entered a cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.593" offset="4035082">It directed the employer depose to various notices in its plant and it also directed the employer on request to bargain with the Union finding that the employer’s unfair labor practices had made it impossible at that point to hold a fair election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.543" offset="4114913">The Court of Appeals upheld the Board’s findings of violation and said that the Board’s order was fine as far as it went, but that it didn’t go far enough, and therefore, remanded the case to the Board to reconsider in the light of a Court of Appeals Tiidee’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.454" offset="4186593">Now, on the remand, the Board granted some, but not all of the remedies that the Union had sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.772" offset="4219820">Specifically, it added these remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.065" offset="4229016">It required the employer to mail this notice which had previously ordered posted in the plants to every employee at his or her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.390" offset="4266318">It directed the employer to give the Union access to company bulletin boards for a period of the year and it also directed the employer to make available to the Union the names and addresses of all the employees and to keep list current for a year to facilitate the Union’s communication with its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.230" offset="4357642">The Board, however, refused to grant certain other requests that the Union had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.503" offset="4382720">It refused to grant an order for company wide bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.231" offset="4401633">It refused to order the employer to read the notices to the employees at an assemblage and it declined to award attorney’s fees and excess organizational expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.081" offset="4449071">The Board recognized there was a probability that as a result of the employer’s unfair labor practices, the Union probably spent more on attorney’s fees and organizational fees that it would have found had there not been the refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.516" offset="4514795">But, the Board concluded and this is on page 38 (a) of the petition, said it wouldn’t unbalance, effectuate the policies of the act to require reimbursement by the employer with respect to these items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.826" offset="4580101">Now, when the Board spoke of effectuating the policies of the Act, it was referring to the statutory provision governing the Board’s authority over order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.373" offset="4626286">Section 10 (c) of the Act which gives the Board power to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without backpay as will effectuate the purpose, the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.159" offset="4681352">The basic rationale of the Board’s decision in this case was that the special role of a charging party before the Board, the group, the person who files the charges, that the role of the charging party was such that it was not necessary to carry out the policies of the Act as a general rule to provide for attorney’s fees and expert organizational expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.123" offset="4789290">As the Board said, I’m reading now briefly from in page 39 (a), “It is the Board which has been given primary initial responsibility to determine and protect the public interest in the elimination of obstructions to commerce resulting from labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.533" offset="4846864">Such protection of the public interest as may result from the charging parties participation in litigation must be regarded, we believe, as incidental to its efforts to protect its own private interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.056" offset="4892944">Given this statutory framework, we conclude that the public interest in allowing the charging party to recover, the cost of its participation in this litigation does not override the general and well-established principle that litigation expenses are ordinarily not recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.395" offset="4958354">Well, now, the Union disagrees with us what the general principle is with respect to the recoverability of litigation expenses in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.952" offset="5000568">We have filed a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.984" offset="5004643">We argue it one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.198" offset="5009554">The Union on argues it the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.259" offset="5017809">Not infrequently lawyers disagree as to what the cases hold, but the critical thing, we think about this is this was just really an additional ground the Board relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.616" offset="5059187">The clinical language we think is the language on page 38 that on balance because of the role of the charging party, it would not effectuate the policies of the Act to permit reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.964" offset="5108611">Now, I just might mention parenthetically in passing since this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.926" offset="5128464">Under the Board’s procedures, as this Court has recognized in the Schofield case, it’s the Board that has the laboring oar in conducting its proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.301" offset="5165976">The charging party has a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.271" offset="5173812">The charging party can may play a greater or lesser role, but it’s the Board that conducts the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.040" offset="5196904">It’s the Board for example that makes the decision whether to seek enforcement of an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.179" offset="5221460">The charging party cannot do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.113" offset="5229192">It is the Board that has the sole authority to cite a respondent for contempt if he fails to comply with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.875" offset="5260225">And therefore, it seems to us that this case is a very different case from the typical situation in which attorney’s fees have been awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.668" offset="5295438">This is a not case in which attorney’s fees have to be awarded in order to encourage people to conduct litigation where that litigation is an important element of implementing the statutory programs and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.820" offset="5352072">This is not a case in which as result of a litigant’s activities, benefit has been conferred upon a group and it’s deemed unfair that the members of that group should not compensate the man who brought the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.567" offset="5419050">I mean, in the case in the Woods case, the case last year under the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.911" offset="5444441">Yes, in the Cole case there what you had was the particular employee had brought a suit in order to vindicate his right to a free speech in opposition to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.141" offset="5493342">The Court held that attorney’s fees were properly paled by the Union in that case because in vindicating his right of free speech, he was also vindicating the rights of free speech of all the members of Union and therefore that all the members of the Union benefited from his endeavors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.341" offset="5562096">Now here, obviously all the members of the Union benefited from the Union’s activities, but it’s the members of the Union who should pay for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.248" offset="5597727">Certainly, the employer in this case cannot be deemed the beneficiary of a litigation the Union conducted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.060" offset="5624999">The Union and the employer were at odds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.587" offset="5639105">Now, when the case came back to the Court of Appeals the second time, the Court of Appeals did not hold as I’ve indicated in any way that it disagreed with the Board’s general premise that ordinarily because of the nature of broad proceedings that counsel fees and organizational expenses should not be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.076" offset="5725100">What it said was it thought the Board’s rationale in this case had been undercut by it’s decision in Tiidee case and that the Board now in effect has conceded that as long as an employer, let me read the precise language the Court of Appeals used because I think it indicates the essence of it’s holding in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.211" offset="5873580">Unfortunately, in this case the various documents divided up in -- among a number of different places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.005" offset="5900748">What the Court said is a bottom of the -- just before the paragraph number 2 on 10 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.046" offset="5924885">It was said it would appear that Board is now recognized that employers will follow a pattern of resisting Union Organization and who to that end unduly burden the processes of the Board and the courts should be oblige at the very least to respond in terms of making good the legal expenses to which they have put the charging parties and the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.430" offset="6002416">We hold that the case before us is an appropriate one for according such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.157" offset="6025404">We think in this, in this holding the Board has completely misinterpreted the Board’s decision in Tiidee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.378" offset="6054243">Tiidee was another case similar to this one; an employer who resisted Union organization demands, who refused to bargain the Board entered the conventional remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.494" offset="6098756">The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board primarily to consider what was called a “make-whole” remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.688" offset="6131461">That is the claim of the Union that relief should include not only cease and desist, etcetera, etcetera, but also to pay to the employees the amounts the Board thinks they would have gotten had there been a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.547" offset="6182975">That was the main issue that was litigated in the Tiidee case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.367" offset="6242220">Yes, the Tiidee panel where Judges Leventhal, Robinson and McGowan, this panel were Judges Leventhal, Bazelon, and McGowan and Judge McGowan wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.469" offset="6286629">Now, in the Tiidee case after this lengthy discussion, the Court almost at the end its opinion added a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.077" offset="6341068">I’m sorry, the end of the discussion in the Tiidee opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.037" offset="6388924">It said that the Board should reconsider on the remand, other lesser remedies beside the make-whole and one of the things it said to consider ultimate remedies such as an award to the Union for excess organization costs, caused by the company’s behavior, or for the cost of having to litigate a frivolous case, the Court’s words, frivolous case or for a combination of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.443" offset="6494563">And earlier in its opinion at page 1249 at 426 F.2nd, the Court said, “The present posture of the Board encourages frivolous litigation not only before the Board but before courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.167" offset="6549420">That is the present posture of the Board in not doing anything more than the conventional remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.161" offset="6573349">In its Tiidee opinion, the Board specifically granted attorney’s fees because this was frivolous litigation that was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.060" offset="6628937">To refer to page 35 and page 36 of the appendix, the brown volume, the Board said that it had previously, as recently noted, normally litigation expenses are not recoverable by the charging party in Board proceedings even though the public interest is served from the charging party protects its private interest before the Board, citing its decision in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.745" offset="6727680">And it went on to say, we agree with the Court, however, the frivolous litigation such as this is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.187" offset="6753489">But then it went on to say the statutory policy of ensuring rights of the employees is encouraged and if its not encouraged further when this frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.401" offset="6794344">And it said, “In order discourage frivolous litigation, future frivolous litigation, page 36 of the appendix and to serve the policies of the Act we decided to award it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.902" offset="6832379">Three times in its discussion at pages 35-36 of the appendix in its Tiidee opinion, it refers to frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.290" offset="6865920">When it came to access organizational expenses, what the Board said was we're not going to award them because as we view this case, there were no access organizational expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.189" offset="6905522">The Union in two months won in election 19 to 6 and it didn’t incur any excess organizational expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.465" offset="6934570">The Court of Appeals interpreted that ruling as somehow indicating that the Board had abandoned its rationale in Heck’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.999" offset="6964767">Somehow because the Board had not said in the Heck’s case, I’m sorry, because the Board had not said in Tiidee case while we have -- while we generally don’t award these things, we don’t have reach the case to see whether it’s an exception here, whether it’s frivolous litigation because in this situation there was no excess expenditures obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.270" offset="7061838">Now, it seems to us, there are two basic points I’d like to make about what the Board did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.491" offset="7082736">First, we think the Board was preeminently reasonable in light of the statutory scheme in concluding that as a general rule, attorney’s fees and litigation expenses should not be accorded as a part of the remedy for unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.413" offset="7146371">That we think is the general rule if properly promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.764" offset="7159850">We also think it acted reasonably in creating the exception it did in Tiidee for frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.638" offset="7187331">Frivolous litigation stands on a very different footing from litigation in which although there are substantial questions to be litigated, nevertheless ultimately it’s held that the defendant has not prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.775" offset="7247830">In this case, in this case although the Board found that the employer had no good faith doubt about the Union’s -- the employer had no good faith doubt about the Union’s majority status, the employer -- the Union -- the employee’s contention had sufficient substance that the trial examiner went the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.211" offset="7321600">We think this is one of those cases where what the Court of Appeals has really done is it has attempted to determine what in fact would be appropriate in this kind of a situation, what would be appropriate relief to effectuate the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.960" offset="7380637">That is a decision with all due respect to the Court of Appeals that Congress has committed to the expert opinion of the Board and not to the courts and we think the Court of Appeals in this case went beyond the proper scope of its relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.618" offset="7435180">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.851" offset="7840183">Mr. Ratner, isn’t it inherent in the doctrine that Mr. Friedman discussed at the close of his argument that this is one of the very delicate matters that the Board deals with and the only to avoid 11 different rules on it is to let the Board have virtually final authority on determining such remedies?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mozart G. Ratner</label>
            <text syncTime="1965.333" offset="7938090">I submit, Mr. Chief Justice that that principle has no application in this case where what the Court of Appeals in effect did was to hold that the Board had acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, and drawn a distinction where there is no material difference in results, in relevant results between what they said about the benefits of organizational expenses to effectuation of the policies of the act in Tiidee and what they said as the Board as their reasons for organization expenses in Tiidee none of which Board remotely on the organizational expenses related solely to the counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.276" offset="8137874">I mean, that it Heck’s, the reasons given in Heck’s for the denial of counsel fees were the same as the reason given for the denial of organizational expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.721" offset="8179670">They’re relevant on the question of counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.196" offset="8193567">They are irrelevant to the question of organizational expenses and the Court of Appeals so held and whether the Board was being arbitrarily, when it distinguished aggravated and persistent violators from those who present frivolous defenses even others may not be even as brazen violations as the law of the persistent recidivist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.821" offset="8291997">Now, we think that unless the scope of judicial review afforded by the Administer Procedure Act is to be narrowed beyond toleration that the Court of Appeals must be allowed at least to set aside administrative inaction or action when it correctly finds that the action or in action is arbitrary in the sense that I have used that term, which means irrational, not materially related and supported by the reasoning given and distinctions without relevant differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.748" offset="8443716">This is, I submit Your Honor what the test should be in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.498" offset="8462733">Did the Court of Appeals -- was the Court of Appeals correct in holding that the Board in effect was arbitrary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.176" offset="8493453">Now there are two respects in which this case is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.370" offset="8522188">One, it is a case of a multiple recidivist whose brazen violations in the Board’s own words are company wide aggravated and pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.705" offset="8579553">The Board found that Heck’s had a policy, a labor policy which was opposed to policies of the Act, and as a result of that policy, within a relatively short time, between 1965 and 1970, Heck’s was involved in unfair practice litigation 11 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.704" offset="8651546">During that period as it happened, the Court of Appeals for Fourth Circuit was holding that the Board couldn’t get a bargain order on authorization cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.554" offset="8695014">And it was only when that was -- it was in that light of that holding that the Board and the trial examiner treated one or two of these Heck’s violation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.682" offset="8743497">One or two other cases actually came to this Court in Gissel as a companion case and of course the judgment below was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.146" offset="8781322">Now, Heck’s strategy was –- oh, I just wanted to add that the reason the Board reversed the trial examiner's determination that there was no refusal to bargain in bad faith was not because it differed with him on the facts, but on it -- because its view that Heck’s was totally unconcerned with whether the Union had a majority or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.973" offset="8868676">It wouldn’t have bargained no matter what the situation was because of its background and history of persistent unfair labor practices, it would have refused to bargain in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.196" offset="8909531">It’s simply demanded an election to gain additional time to undermine the Union and when it had done that of course it fought with it, litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.513" offset="8946834">Now, the strategy that Heck’s used was to transfer, discharge or close its door or threaten to do those things if the Union got in to engage in excessive interrogation, coercive interviews and illegal polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.849" offset="9024157">When the Union requested recognition, Heck’s would step up its campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.936" offset="9040457">It routinely refused to look at authorization cards that Union tendered in support of its request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.036" offset="9060937">It demanded an election to gain time within which to undermine the Union further and thereby forced the Union and the general counsel to litigate, to establish that Union had an un-coerced majority when it have requested recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.960" offset="9124571">Now, the Board treats frivolous litigation as if somehow the litigation had been initiated by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.795" offset="9167935">That’s not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.477" offset="9170651">Of course, the employers have responded in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.341" offset="9182145">The real way to see that, the only way to see that is to see that the employer is willing to submit to litigation even though he has gotten a plausible defense or no matter how brazen his violations are in the hope like Mr. McCoben that something will turn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.812" offset="9240033">And if he is able to attack the Union’s card showing, well, that’s let him free of the hook because if he has -- Union hasn’t got a valid majority of un-coerced cards, it doesn’t have a right, but that isn’t why he acted illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.808" offset="9291964">All of his illegal action was devoted to destroying the support for the Union whether or not they have a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.348" offset="9318191">So what really is happening here is that employer is using, he is provoking the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.471" offset="9342642">He is provoking the Union and compelling it to resort to litigation, it and the Board to resort to litigation and then he goes along, hopes he wins, he doesn’t care how long it takes in effect for long as long possible to ward off the evil bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.039" offset="9424875">And then when the evil day arrives probably finds the Union totally impotent to engage in bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.616" offset="9451207">The Board has recognized all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.990" offset="9464686">In its decision in Tiidee, its supplemental opinion in Tiidee following the remand from the Court of Appeals, the Board had this to say, and oh yes before I get to that I should mention that when Mr. Friedman says that the Board’s decision -- the Court’s decision in Tiidee related only to frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.589" offset="9575131">He omits the fact that the remand in the Heck’s itself was predicated not on the frivolity of the defense, but on the persistent and aggravated bad faith conduct which the Board itself had found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.541" offset="9622883">So there can be no justification whatever for claiming that the Board was -- could properly have believed that all the Court of Appeals meant was it should award counsel fees in cases of frivolous litigation and not where they’re aggravated and persistent violations as where in Heck’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.192" offset="9689548">That distinction just simply blown out on the basis of the Heck’s remand itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.194" offset="9709505">Now, the Court of Appeals, the Board accepts the remand in the Heck’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.553" offset="9742942">As we understand it that means that they were content to attempt to follow what the Board -- what the Court had told them to do and one of the things that the Court had told them it had to do was to consider at least some of the alternative remedies, including organization expense -- excess organizational expenses and counsel fees that had been requested by other parties including the Union in the Heck’s case as alternative to the so called make-all remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.887" offset="9848268">On page 33 of the appendix is the Board’s explanation in its supplemental opinion in Tiidee of what it thought the remand meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.843" offset="9896124">The Board believes, they consider why we find it would be counterproductive to grant the Union’s request for a remand to the trial examiner, the Board believes that the alternative remedies provided here and after will undo some of the baneful affects pointed out by the court as having resulted from respondent’s clear and flagrant violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.759" offset="9971775">No, that has nothing to do with the frivolity of the defense or the frivolity of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.392" offset="9994344">These are the effects that flow from respondent’s clear and flagrant violation of the law. Indeed, that’s how a Union basically loses it support among the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.114" offset="10033215">The exception always proves the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.088" offset="10041051">It won the case to the election in Tiidee, but it lost in Heck’s and that is most common experience that Unions have, where you have clear and flagrant aggravated violations of a law such as the respondent engaged in this case, you’re going to inevitably have as a result, the loss of support for the Union by the employees whether it lost their support either from complete support to majority or from majority to a minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.995" offset="10148780">Now, to continue with the Board's statement, these remedies will for; one aid the Union in rebuilding strength so that it may bargain effectively with the respondent and also by requiring respondent that the pay some Board in the litigation cost occasioned by this misconduct similar brazen refusals will be discarded.</text>
