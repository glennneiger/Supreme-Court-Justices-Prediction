            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We?ll hear arguments next in 73-206, Parker against Levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.828" offset="240013">Mr. Solicitor General you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="43.113" stopTime="886.414">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="43.113" offset="249208">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.883" offset="260284">This appeal, which is obviously similar in many respects to the case we?ve just heard concerns even more obviously I think the values I suggested were protected by Article 134 and here Article 133 as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.358" offset="326217">The conduct here is specially egregious and I think it is impossible for anybody to say that the appellee here could not have known, must not have known what he was doing was prejudicial to good order and discipline was not the standard of conduct expected of an officer and gentleman and indeed of course he was also convicted under Article 90 for the direct disobedience of the lawful order of the superior commissioned officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.674" offset="455471">Upon conviction, Captain Levy was sentenced to dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for three years at hard labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.928" offset="496431">Now, Article 90 as I say provides for the punishment of anyone subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice who willfully disobeys a lawful command of a superior commissioned officer and the specification or charge levied against Captain Levy was that he willfully disobeyed the colonel?s command to establish and operate a phase two training program for Special Forces aide men in dermatology.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.915" offset="608444">And the evidence showed that one of the functions of the hospital to which he was assigned which was Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he went there as soon as he was taken into the service, was to train Special Forces aide men where men capable of giving certain levels of medical service in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.159" offset="697365">Captain Levy was the Chief of the Dermatology Service, in fact he was the only trained dermatologist at that hospital and he had the responsibility to conduct this training.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.873" offset="732264">For a time he did so during early 1966 and then he did so with increasing irregularity and incompleteness.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.620" offset="763193">Reports began to come in to the colonel, Colonel Francey who commanded the hospital the training was not being done adequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.713" offset="787644">He investigated and discovered that Captain Levy had by now totally neglected his duties in training aide men.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.102" offset="821185">He called Colonel Levy before him and handed him a written order to conduct the training required.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.915" offset="848457">Captain Levy read the order, announced that he understood it but further announced that he would not obey it because there is medical ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.736" offset="879700">He was told that obedience was nonetheless expected, he persisted in his refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.918" offset="900389">It was interesting in a way because his enlisted subordinates offered to carry out the training for him and he ordered them using his rank as a captain, not to conduct the training of these Special Forces aide men and threatened them with punishment if they disobeyed his order.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.756" offset="967784">The Attorney was determined that nobody was going to receive any training in dermatology in that hospital and he used his rank as an officer to carry out that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.335" offset="1014073">He continued to persist over a period of a month or two to obey that order and ultimately disciplinary action in the form of an Article 90 charge was levied against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.233" offset="1061721">Now, Article 134, as we just heard under which he was also charged prescribes, among other things, as I have said, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces and all conduct and nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.576" offset="1127027">The specification in Article 133 as I have mentioned as the -- provides punishment for conduct of unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.054" offset="1160986">The specification under 134 is set forth by pages 8 and 9 of our brief and I shall merely mention some of the statements which he made to enlisted men under his command and to others apparently coming through the clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.616" offset="1223262">The statements he made orally contain such sentences as, ?I would refuse to go to Vietnam if ordered to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.263" offset="1253773">I do not see why any colored soldier would go to Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.246" offset="1265685">They should refuse to go to Vietnam and if sent should refuse to fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.656" offset="1283344">If I were a colored soldier I would refuse to go to Vietnam and if I were a colored soldier and I was sent, I would refuse to fight,? and then he referred of course to Special Forces personnel as liars, thieves, killers of peasants, murderers of women and children and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.748" offset="1335693">The specification under Article 133 is much the same, involves the same allegations of the same kinds of remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.900" offset="1384385">The evidence showed that during 1966, while he was on duty in the dermatology clinic, on many occasions, Captain Levy made remarks of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.195" offset="1429525">He engaged in conversations, many of them completely one sided with aide men undergoing training with patients and visitors, he did it in the open, in the presence of enlisted men, of civilian personnel and patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.002" offset="1496712">He was convicted under Articles 90, 133 and 144 and sentenced, as I have said, he exhausted his appeals on the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.559" offset="1543001">Ultimately, after much litigation he warned up with a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania which denied its petition but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding Articles 133 and 134 unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.237" offset="1609665">It also held, with one Judge, Chief Judge Sykes dissenting that the possibility of prejudice, under Article 90 for the direct disobedience of a lawful order.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.499" offset="1658776">Due to the fact that trial have been held under two articles held unconstitutional, required that the Article 90 charge would be overturned and sent back for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.009" offset="1700780">We brought this case here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.931" offset="1712483">Now at the outset, I should say that the appellee?s brief raises some 14 numbered points and many of these are, I supposed offered as alternative grounds for affirmance but these were points not addressed or decided by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and we suggest that the proper way to handle this would be that should the Government prevail, on its arguments on 133, 134 and 90, that the proper course should be to remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of all these other points which it did not consider or decide and a decision on those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.052" offset="1888967">So I will confine myself to the jurisdictional objections raised here and to the argument about the articles themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.433" offset="1930449">Captain Levy raises two jurisdictional objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.132" offset="1949257">The first one is that this is not properly an appeal to the Supreme Court under 28 United States Code Section 1252.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.334" offset="1998054">I don?t -- we have explained that in our brief, I don?t think it requires extensive argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.441" offset="2030550">The Court noted that the jurisdictional question was reserved and noting probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.668" offset="2063464">1252 says that any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory or final judgment of any Court of the United States, holding an act of Congress unconstitutionally and on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.154" offset="2129398">It provides for an appeal in this kind of a case, the Court of Appeals as any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.528" offset="2146847">An act of Congress has been held unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.808" offset="2160013">The Reviser?s notes indicate that this language was deliberately chosen to allow appeals from any Federal Court decision holding an Act of Congress invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.054" offset="2204944">In addition to that, we rely upon the fact that Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of a public procedure prescribes a mechanism for notifying the Attorney General constitutional questions arising in Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.086" offset="2265130">The purpose is to allow the Attorney General to intervene, if a constitutional question about a Federal statute is raised so that he may then take an appeal from any decision against the constitutionality of a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.380" offset="2318315">So I think it?s quite clear that we are properly here on an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.647" offset="2335347">I think it is also quite clear that under 28 United States Code Section 2103 that if we?re not properly here by a way of appeal, this should be treated as a petition for certiorari and if you go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.576" offset="2387069">But there is one other or two other jurisdictional points raised by appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.590" offset="2415073">The first one is that a government attorney filed the notice of appeal in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and that government attorney was not an attorney of record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.368" offset="2462198">I don?t know why there?s any objection to the filing of notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.076" offset="2489051">This case was tried in the District Court in the Middle of the District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.086" offset="2505143">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is in the third, in the Eastern District and the Department of Justice ordered the Assistant U.S. Attorney in this Eastern District to file a notice of appeal in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.745" offset="2567732">He was acting as an agent of the Government and I cannot understand what is wrong with that filing of a notice of appeal since we utterly frivolous objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.544" offset="2602945">The other objection is that a person certifying the service of the notice of appeal, same man who filed it, was not a member of the bar of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.817" offset="2647980">Now Rule 10 of this Court says that these appeals are to be filed in the Court of Appeals in the manner prescribed by Rule 33 of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.066" offset="2701061">That we did as to the manner prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.607" offset="2715167">The Court of Appeals covering the person who must certify rules will seem to -- the Court of Appeals rules cover the person whom was certifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.573" offset="2747037">So I take it that Rule 33 is questioned as to persons does not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.042" offset="2776921">I don?t think there?s any jurisdictional question, I merely discussed it because when it?s raised and the Court notes that it wants to hear about it, I have had an obligation to talk about it unless there is further reason to discuss it, I assume to passed on to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.103" offset="2853198">We have here an Article 134 argument which is much the same as the argument in the average case, and I like to read the page just like part of that quite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.559" offset="2898965">As Mr. Justice White noted, it would be a little hard to attack the statute facially given the fact that as to certain areas, there are decided cases which say these things fall within 134.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.721" offset="2947657">So it would hard to strike it down facially on those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.824" offset="2960091">I would suggest also that the Letter Carriers case and Broadrick against Oklahoma certainly indicate that where the statute applies primarily to non-speech activities, facial invalidation may not be called for, is not called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.619" offset="3035220">Finally, not only our vagueness and overbreadth eliminated by the fact as we?ve already considered, now, I suggest that it takes less than 30 days when one enters the military to perceive that one is in a new and different culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.401" offset="3106377">Not only the limiting constructions, the contexts, the military function, all of which is obvious to anybody in it, indeed the people outside it.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.755" offset="3143784">I want to repeat the fact, which I think is crucial in this case, and that is it would be impossible to write a detailed Code of Conduct under 134 or the Article 133.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.575" offset="3195089">I mentioned in the speech area the why -- since we regulate all conduct in the military, unlike the civilian world which is possible to say make a rifle shot statute and say you won?t do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.609" offset="3235213">We regulate all conduct in the military world, we want affirmative action out of the military in the way we are doing out of the civilian population.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.013" offset="3260813">The military has a defined function, it has a goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.435" offset="3274501">Civilian society has no single goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.695" offset="3287562">For that reason we regulate everything towards a defined goal, the goal tells us what conduct violates the achievement of that goal, the fact that everything is regulated makes it impossible to write a detailed code.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.080" offset="3341061">We have to use words, which men have common understanding, can understand when they realize what kind of a society they are living in and what its object is.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.544" offset="3386932">And I suggest again, there are many areas of life, other than the military where we have found it either impossible or not desirable to write a code.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.311" offset="3426011">We have, as I say I suggest the Sherman Act, we have had some partial attempts to codify the Sherman Act, and they either turn out to be tumult on antitrust law which is -- does not guide one the details that turned out to be the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.227" offset="3505633">And those codifications in themselves turn out to be enormously vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.353" offset="3522142">So I think we are dealing in an area where it is simply impossible to write the detailed code, the rifle shot series of statutes that we would cover every aspect of allowable conduct in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.021" offset="3576790">That being true, I think the kind of articles we have here are inevitable and desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.584" offset="3619109">It is --</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.323" offset="7702047">Now what the prosecutor did in the trial was to take the additional two charges we had that were dismissed and he used those two charges plus these two pure speech charges and use those charges from the opening statement to the closing argument to demonstrate Levy?s opposition to the war which went to the question of intent and willfulness on the disobedience of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2760.343" offset="11118132">Now, when you start talking about statutes, I want to mention two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.763" offset="11143837">First, if it is too difficult to write, then it is too difficult for a serviceman to understand if it is not written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.470" offset="11166616">And the second thing is, that Army regulation 600-20 paragraph 423 says a serviceman ?have a right to express their opinions privately and informally on all political subjects and candidates and to become candidates for public office.?</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.558" offset="11246968">Now what the Army presently has, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, you were asking about debating societies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.681" offset="11275494">It looks to me like under this Army regulation you can have folks in the same company, going out and running against each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.149" offset="11301303">Now, I think if you are going to regulate speech, you cannot have your cake and eat it too in the Army and that is what they got now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.415" offset="11426377">Not really, it?s that is only a part of it and of course that?s a medical question, as far as, whether it? better or worse like if you gave everybody a penicillin shot , would the world be better off or not and some doctors would argue either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.203" offset="11469531">In this case we brought forward the following witnesses:</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.116" offset="11481234">John Mayer (ph), Dr. Saddap (ph), Peter Bourne of the Walter Reed Institute of Research and they came forward, these physicians and they said this is an appropriate ethical concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.800" offset="11535987">They said we recognize this and physicians who were in the Army said if they had Levy?s factual knowledge if what he knew was true, Dr. Mauer and others, they would not give training.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.961" offset="11580604">Now the concern was just not to how this treatment came on the field, for instance Dr. Bourne came to a different conclusion on ethical concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.780" offset="11603905">He thought it went the other way in as far as he personally was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.207" offset="11617593">But the question was, may the physician for a valid ethical concern as with most ethics, is it right or wrong, is another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.908" offset="11656359">And Levy?s position primarily was not that the people out in the field were worst off or better off with medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.135" offset="11677257">Levy?s position was that they were military personnel using medicine for military and political purposes and that (b) would never know whether they were better off with or without it and throughout the record it is quite interesting to go back and see what Special Forces have testified about the quality of medical care out there in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.203" offset="11741518">They are saying they go in and they use words like panax, witch doctors and acupuncturists, doctors with needles, I am not so sure those folks, myself when I got there, were better off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.938" offset="11788539">Well, the question really comes down to whether that is a judgment that the subordinate officers in the military are free to make, isn?t that what this case comes to?</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.017" offset="11820826">As to whether doctors or subordinate officers in the military are free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.991" offset="11840679">Yes, there is no question that you can?t to that to a chaplain, there?s no question that there?s an attorney-client privilege in the military but there is no physician-patient privilege recognized and doctors are different and the nature of their works there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.957" offset="11904627">Now I want to mention this to you, as far as conduct unbecoming an officer, a gentleman is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.451" offset="11926570">There was a case in 1827 in which the court-martial decided that the conduct of an admiral, the first Jewish Commodore rather in the Navy, Admiral Commodore Uriah Levy, they decided then that the conduct of a dual over honor was conduct unbecoming an officer but not that of a gentleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.654" offset="12011416">Now, I submit to you that even on the face of the statute, if you take its words at fair meaning, conduct unbecoming an officer can also be sometimes itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.487" offset="12050704">Conduct becoming a gentleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.513" offset="12058749">And that the statute in its very words are mutually inconsistent and that in this case for instance, have they charged Dr. Levy?s conduct of not allowing Special Forces to walk in and stare at his woman-patients, that under that circumstance lots of us would consider the conduct would have been appropriate with respect to a gentleman but not an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.635" offset="12147252">With respect to 134 and 133, there is no question in this record whether Dr. Levy did not have the notice that the appellant?s case is based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.368" offset="12186227">He came into the service, he did not get the training other Army doctors get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.440" offset="12202527">They did not take him to Fort Sam Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.850" offset="12212140">They brought him in and they put him in the clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.933" offset="12224470">Throughout the case, there?s no -- there?s not an iota of evidence that Levy knew what was prohibited or what wasn?t prohibited under 133 or 134.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.600" offset="12263131">Now beyond that, the Army regulation says that he may express his opinion privately and informally on all political subjects and candidates and to become candidates for public officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.475" offset="12306599">Where did he express his opinion?</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.102" offset="12313182">He did it in his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.154" offset="12325407">Now what was Levy doing in his spare time?</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.832" offset="12332095">He didn?t join the Officer?s Club, that?s in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.383" offset="12342230">He went out and participated, and vote a registration campaigns in civil rights work in civilian clothes off post, off based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.523" offset="12370860">And we have been attempting a civilian counsel with a clearance for top secret in another military case to get our hands on the very G2-A that the colonel testified, he upgraded the charges after reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.271" offset="12433868">He based the upgrading of charges from Article 15 to a general court-martial after he read the G2-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.299" offset="12461976">They gave us 80 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.885" offset="12468245">They gave our military counsel 180 pages and said he could not tell me what was in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.834" offset="12492069">And we know now because they wrote the District Court that 25 pages came from non-Army sources and had to get released on that and everything down the line but the very charges Colonel Francey testified were based upon the G2-A and his reading of it and he upgraded it on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.794" offset="12555912">Now, this -- with respect to Broadrick and with respect to Letter Carriers, it seems to me that Levy complies completely with the requirements of that case and that this case is quite appropriate for judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.434" offset="12630518">In Broadrick and in Letter Carriers, you have a statute which goes to political activity and in effect to political speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.702" offset="12659566">In this case, you have a statute which goes to everything and does so by its nature and because that is what the service wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.964" offset="12688614">We can stand up here and talk about defining and doing this and that but the very purpose for 133 and 134 is, to catch all its catch 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.348" offset="12722155">They say that the purpose of it is to get all sorts of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.575" offset="12743053">To talk about the findings, that is not what the military wants with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.524" offset="12754860">Not only does it not want to -- it doesn?t want to tell you about political speech, it wants to keep its political speech under its regulations and it wants to keep the right for its people to run for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.343" offset="12794149">Now, Letter Carriers didn?t do that, Broadrick didn?t do that, and neither of those two cases say in the least anything which in any way, inhibits the right of Dr. Levy to strike down these two statutes on behalf of himself, not on behalf of some conduct for someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.360" offset="12870217">Now, I want to -- words are harsh, Dr. Levy used. Not so harsh in retrospect as they were back then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.782" offset="12931866">He was on overseas at a military post.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.282" offset="12953913">He was at Fort Jackson, South Carolina in a dermatology clinic.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.936" offset="13056522">If you will go to page 2497 of the record, the prosecutor says of course the Government?s position is like any law, the provisions of the Uniform Code are without specific notification binding on any individual in the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.219" offset="13105633">It?s only when we get here that the quad drills stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.742" offset="13123709">Now, I -- the case presents many questions but the one thing that the case does not present is a doctor who refused to train medical personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.865" offset="13196225">The one thing that the case does not present is a circumstance wherein a person was convicted, wherein a person was convicted for anything other than his political beliefs and beliefs that were thrust upon him and charged against him by Colonel Henry Franklin Francey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.777" offset="13275847">I have an extract in the record as to what this loyalty means and what this affection means in the brief, perhaps, that will demonstrate appropriately that tremendous confusion that can occur with the use of words that nobody knows the meaning of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.607" offset="13339167">But I know the meaning of a three-year sentence which he received and the meaning of that sentence was that these officers with no standard for judgment and a prosecutor with no standard for judgment and a colonel who testified on the basis of an undisclosed-A, he was charged in this fellow with being disloyal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.473" offset="13414609">That they took those charges and catapulted them up and the only thing that was conduct unbecoming an officer or a gentleman in the entire case, and the only discredit that came to the service was the court-martial process in the fact that it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.489" offset="13474691">It seemed to me that the officer who testified David Travis at that time perhaps the most decorated American in Vietnam combat soldier, who said, ?Sure I have been at Fort Jackson,? and he was black ?and I?ve been with Dr. Levy and he?s talked to me and I?ve disagreed with him.?</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.985" offset="13540728">But he says, ?That?s what I am in Vietnam fighting for.?</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.847" offset="13556088">His free expression then I asked him, ?And where do you go from here??</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.742" offset="13575732">And he said, ?Back to Vietnam.?</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.936" offset="13588480">I submit to you that that is really what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.142" offset="13601332">It?s the right of a person to express themselves freely, in private, to practice medicine, and to give the military their very best even if they don?t want to and maybe those problems will go away, now that we?ve come to the position that we do not have a drafted military service, but a voluntary military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.470" offset="13682625">And perhaps, I don?t know that will result in some military men when they are entering the service, giving up some of those rights of civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.637" offset="13715331">If it does and they are going to write a statute, they better get away from saying military men can run for office and discuss privately any political matters that come to their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.319" offset="13753992">Thank you.</text>
