            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="48.592" offset="271151">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.289" offset="285884">This case turns on the constitutionality of Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.836" offset="312111">That article punishes among other things, all disorders and neglects of the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.944" offset="348473">In all conduct of a nature to bring this credit upon the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.391" offset="366341">The article entered our military jurisprudence that was enacted by the Congress in 1775 and has been reenacted repeatedly since then by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.061" offset="405002">The first reenactment occurring in 1806, apparently the man who wrote the constitution had no doubt of its compatibility with this article.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.421" offset="446380">It’s been in effect as an organic part of our military law now for just under 200 years and in our history millions and tons of millions of service man and woman have served under this Article.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.529" offset="506880">It is a settled -- a piece of our jurisprudence, I suppose as there is at stake, in the issue of the constitutionality of this Article, of course are several fundamental values of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.028" offset="568842">Appellee here urges the values of fair warning in due process and free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.803" offset="596010">I will attempt to show that Article 134 is fully compatible with those values and does not threaten.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.272" offset="625789">But must also be recognized, however, is that the judicial destruction of Article 134 would jeopardize two other important values in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.576" offset="671033">The first of course is the effect of those American Armed Forces upon which the safety of the nation rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.868" offset="696216">The second, however, is a value which I think is not sufficiently recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.281" offset="717845">And that is the importance of Article 134 in confining the role of the military in our national political processes and decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.501" offset="766746">Should speech of the sort involved in this case and in Captain Levy’s case which we argue next, come to be permitted in the military?</text>
            <text syncTime="182.304" offset="805930">There would be real danger that our military would become so unreliable as to frustrate civilian policy to be unable to carry out civilian policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.242" offset="849711">But worst than that, it seems to me that there might be a danger of a politicized military establishment with all the dangers that prospect poses for the principle of civilian control of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.932" offset="912509">This speech in these cases in opposition to warnings and if its permissible for a PFC and a captain to make these publications or attempt these publications and make these speeches under these circumstances, then I do not see why it will not be permissible equally for general officers and admirals to address their troops about their political views and about their disagreement with the President of United States and about their disagreement with warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.345" offset="1042077">We are not dealing with small issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.158" offset="1065378">The appellee Mark Avrech brought this action in the District Court for the District of Columbia to expunge his court-martial conviction which was under Article 80 which punishes attempts, and the attempt was to violate Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.593" offset="1143118">The District Court dismissed his suit but the Court of Appeals reversed holding that Article 134 as unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.626" offset="1179272">The conduct underlying this court-martial conviction occurred at the Marble Mountain Air Facility in Da Nang in Vietnam where PFC Avrech was on active of duty with the Marine Corps in a combat zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.352" offset="1234129">While on night duty, in the group supply officers at his base, Avrech typed of a stencil of a statement entitled “The Truth” and marked volume 1, number 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.589" offset="1279060">This statement is set out in full at pages 4 and 5 of the Government’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.218" offset="1313646">And he intended to circulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.848" offset="1320124">He said only to eight or 10 of his friends in the Marine Corps.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.692" offset="1343530">The statement is the denunciation of the United States military rule in Vietnam and it contained such sentences as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.794" offset="1375922">“Why should we go out and fight there in the South Vietnamese?</text>
            <text syncTime="327.778" offset="1387833">Why should we go out and fight with their battles while they sit home and complain about communist aggression?</text>
            <text syncTime="333.029" offset="1408836">What are we cannon fodder or human beings?”</text>
            <text syncTime="336.396" offset="1422315">Going on, “The United States has no business over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.424" offset="1438407">Are your opinions worth risking a court-martial?</text>
            <text syncTime="343.211" offset="1449587">We must strive for peace and if not peace then a complete U.S. withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.039" offset="1464947">We have been sitting ducks for too long.”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.572" offset="1479053">The statement is more extensive than that and that is in tone and in substance a denunciation as I say in United States warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.734" offset="1515729">I think that there is no doubt that had PFC Avrech succeeded in publishing that statement, the document would tend to create disaffection among the troops and it would certainly create lowered morale among troops in a combat zone.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="379.062" offset="1592947">Well I suppose it might reasonably said that it would stimulate some debate on the subject when you have one group of soldiers one way and -- or marines on one side and another group on another side?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="391.277" stopTime="414.538">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="391.277" offset="1641848">It certainly would stimulate debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.722" offset="1647595">I think that is certainly fair Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.423" offset="1654491">In addition to that apparently although he was not charged but the record in the case the summary of the record in the case, the original record of transcript has been destroyed, indicates that PFC Avrech constantly stimulated debate about -- among his fellows, about the wrongness of the United States warnings.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.685" offset="1779461">Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="430.367" offset="1798165">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.486" offset="1806733">We were discussing at the lunch break the facts of this case having typed out on a stencil his denunciation of the warnings in United States for circulation to the troops and it was entitled Volume 1 Part 1 because PFC Avrech testified that he had intended to publish other such statements as his thinking developed along this lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.452" offset="1922508">Having typed up this first statement, Avrech attempted to gain access to the supply office mimeograph machine in order to run the statement off.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.462" offset="1958557">And in the process he showed in to a corporal who controlled the machine, the corporal took the statement and gave it to a superior and as a result, Avrech was tried before a special court-martial on charges of violating Articles 134 and 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.212" offset="2013623">The court martial acquitted him on the Article 134 charge but convicted him under Article 80 which as I say punishes attempts to commit offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.836" offset="2048104">And here the specification, the charge under Article 80 charged an attempt to commit an offense under Article 134 namely an attempt to publish to members of the Armed Forces with design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the troops, the statement disloyal to United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.347" offset="2122188">This charge required a finding of specific intent and was modeled on a standard form, contained in the manual for court-martial. Upon conviction, Avrech was reduced in rank from private first class to private, sentenced to forfeiture of three months’ pay, and sentenced to one month hard labor and confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.711" offset="2191569">The commanding officer suspended the confinement in all of the respects to the regular review process the conviction and the sentence were affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.023" offset="2228872">So that he received a rather mild sentence but did not put any bad conduct discharge in his record and did not confine him in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.242" offset="2273698">The appellee challenged this conviction under one Fifth Amendment doctrine void for vagueness and two aspects of First Amendment doctrine overbreadth and the claim that the statement he attempted to issue was protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.813" offset="2332003">I think none of these contentions can withstand examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.703" offset="2347572">I would like to examine the vagueness point first.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.945" offset="2360529">I think it’s essential to realize that there is no doubt that a parallel statute applied to the civilian population would be unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.563" offset="2407027">Nobody would know in a free and permissive society what was conceivably meant by something like disorders and neglects to the prejudice of social order.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.569" offset="2447047">The difference of course is that a civilian society is basically a free society; it is not and furthermore it has no single mission unlike the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.023" offset="2480797">The military society is an ordered society, it has a mission, it has a structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.231" offset="2505665">And for that reason, one knows what tends to detract from that mission, what tends to break down discipline and good order.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.222" offset="2541610">Now counsel for the appellee argued this case as if it did involve a statute applied to the civilian population.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.443" offset="2570553">And they refused I think to face the only issue, the real issue which is the military context in which this article exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.676" offset="2599497">Indeed in which this article has been -- which this article has been an organic part for 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.443" offset="2622485">And that is what makes all the difference in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.157" offset="2637427">That context and the limiting constructions given by the United States Court of Military Appeals, give Article 134 the definiteness it requires.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="649.151" offset="2673371">What did the Court of Appeals say about that argument of yours?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="653.169" offset="2689463">The Court of Appeals thought that the military context did not give it sufficient definiteness Mr. Justice Douglas but I think I can demonstrate that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.436" offset="2734498">One, it seems to me extremely telling point in this case is that counsel for the appellee argued this case by a series of hypothetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.043" offset="2772950">Although this Article has been used for 200 years, they do not cite a single case of injustice done by the military under this Article.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.707" offset="2819553">They do not cite a single case in which a convicted serviceman could not -- in which a convicted serviceman could have entertained any doubt that what he did was prejudicial to good order and discipline and that what he did was wrong and illegal so far as a military society was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.276" offset="2889874">Whatever superficial plausibility appellee's challenge has is gained only by ignoring the meaning given by military function in context by ignoring the actual operation of the military system and arguing instead from wholly imaginary cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.476" offset="2954658">The Court of Military Appeals has repeatedly said at this Article that it reaches only misconduct and disorders which are directly and probably prejudicial to good order and discipline so that the construction placed upon by the Court of Military Appeals and followed by the Courts-Martial is that the tendency to injure good order and discipline must be direct and it must be obvious or reasonable manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.723" offset="3063641">In addition to that of course, the Manual for Courts-Martial which is in the appendix to our brief discuses at page 7 (a) this Article and the specific charge of disloyal speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.360" offset="3390171">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.218" offset="3401665">But aside from history and tradition, it seems to me that the most important and obvious facts about this case is that the military does comprise a specialized community, it has a well understood and a specialized function which is something a civilian community does not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.333" offset="3478047">And the need for order and discipline in that specialized community is known throughout our culture and it is obvious to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.093" offset="3505110">It is also obvious what kinds of behavior tend to break that down.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.643" offset="3523291">Now, at this point I would like to say that the military use of this kind of penal statute is by no means unique in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.857" offset="3572193">This is not confined to military law of any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.059" offset="3592986">Court’s frequently apply standards of this sort when they are given content by an understood function and although on the face of the words they may seem vague when they are in context they are not vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.889" offset="3664353">And I think this is true in a variety of areas and I would like to mention a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.615" offset="3679190">In the first place and most obviously the Sherman Act is vague, criminal proscriptions against things like combinations in restraint of trade were upheld in Nash against United States largely because the Justice Holmes said because of the antecedent common law among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.121" offset="3745228">The antecedent common law was really not a great deal of help, but in the -- he explained further in International Harvester against Kentucky that criminal law is not unconstitutional merely because it throws upon men the risk of rightly estimating a matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.297" offset="3809907">And here the matter of degree is what is an undue restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.921" offset="3828402">Between the obviously illegal and the plainly lawful there’s a gradual approach and that the complexity of life makes it impossible to draw a line in advance without an artificial simplification that would be unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.724" offset="3891618">The conditions are as permanent as anything human and conditions there of course were the conditions of trade and economics.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.162" offset="3921398">Here the conditions are permission and understood function of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.061" offset="3945012">And the great body of precedents on the civil side coupled with familiar practice make it comparatively easy for common sense to keep to what's safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.849" offset="3976150">That passage, I think would only superficial alterations could have been written in defense of Article 134 and Article 134 if I may say so is if anything clear than the Sherman Act was before that we received construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.041" offset="4992940">But I have mentioned the vagueness of the Sherman Act which was saved by its context and by our knowledge of economics, the criminal offense of man slaughter, we rely upon the common understanding of man as to what is dangerously negligent behavior in a vast multiplicity of examples that would be beyond the skill of a legislative craftsman to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.970" offset="5116656">Now if I turn to examples involving speech, I might mention that courts often permit indefinite wording if context gives the wording meaning and a parallel example it seems to me is Grayned against City of Rockford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.341" offset="5170155">And this Court there upheld a conviction under anti-noise ordinance that published the willful making of noise or diversion that took disturbs or tends to disturb the peace or good order of schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.204" offset="5229610">Interpreting it to apply to actual or imminent interference with peace or good order and relying upon the school of context as giving meaning to disturbance as impact on the normal activities of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.058" offset="5272973">The context there gave fair notice and I think the context of the military gives fair notice to a statute, to an article which is written very much like the anti-noise ordinance was in Grayned against City of Rockford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.935" offset="5316441">I might also suggest that courts regularly apply penalties for contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.246" offset="5345698">That would seem to be a fairly vague standard and it does inhibit speech quite directly but it is made sufficiently definite by the common understanding of the function of a courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.737" offset="5403690">The function of the legal system and what that function requires in the way of good order and discipline by the part of attorneys who take argument in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.585" offset="5451128">And finally, I would like to cite as very close to this case the clear and present danger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.974" offset="5476624">That is a test that is read into criminal statutes on speech about over-throw of the government or violence, the advocacy of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.525" offset="5506821">And hence it becomes a warning, the clear and present danger test is a warning that must be intelligible to those the law threatens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.678" offset="5539422">And in Dennis against United States, this Court explained those words as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.951" offset="5560529">It said that Chief Judge Learned Hand writing for the majority below interpreted the phrase as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.987" offset="5588741">“In each case, courts must ask whether the gravity of the evil discounted by its improbability justify such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.153" offset="5641404">Then this Court said, “We adopt this statement of the rule as articulated by Chief Judge Hand, is as succinct and inclusive as any other we might device at this time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.394" offset="5686335">It takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant and relates their significances, more we cannot expect from words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.386" offset="5726250">It seems to me that Article 134 is certainly no vaguer than that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.398" offset="5758328">I agree that more we cannot expect from words, I think more we cannot expect from words in the context to which 134 is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.624" offset="5787272">I think it does an equally good job of relating the factors and their significances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.581" offset="5815066">And there is one other parallel I’d like to draw that between Article 134 and Hatch Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.428" offset="5854459">This Court was upheld the Hatch Act last term in the Civil Service Commission against National Association of Letter Carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.672" offset="5879432">And at this point, I’m discussing not so much vagueness as overbreadth and the legitimate interest of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.450" offset="5902524">This Court held in the civilian context that the legitimate interest of government in good government and in a fair political process was enough to uphold the Hatch Act’s restrictions upon government employee’s political activities against First Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.390" offset="5974309">So here I think the legitimate interest in an effective military and in a military that does not dictate civilian policy either by becoming ineffective so that it cannot carry outlaws, or by becoming so politicized that it refuses to carry out the policy made by civilians, justifies Article 134 has very limited inhibitions on speech just as the Hatch Act was justified for parallel reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.548" offset="6118922">In this case, I think it’s obvious that the publication average would have published, would have tended to spread disaffection among troops in the combat zone and that cannot be tolerated by any effective military organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.444" offset="6174511">There may have been armies that tolerated that kind of behavior but they were armies on the verge of dissolution and not armies that win wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.370" offset="6206276">And aside from the tendency to disaffect others, statements such as these even if they convince no one of a deleterious effect upon morale because they signaled to others that at least one man in the unit is not to be relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.383" offset="6266253">It is already disaffected and it maybe an unreliable and dangerous or difficult situation which I think is surely a factor, the military entitled to take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.234" offset="6309721">It is apparent, I think that the Article as applied in this case was not unduly vague nor does it violate Avrech’s First Amendment rights since those rights must vary according to the time, place and circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.797" offset="6367922">And speech of this sort in a combat zone can hardly be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.194" offset="6389551">It might be different in other military circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.410" offset="6402403">It might be different if you were in the states in civilian uniform talking to man off base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.097" offset="6421107">In a combat zone it cannot be protected speech I would not think.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.914" offset="10580428">Now the Government really doesn’t seriously challenge the historical evidence and really makes no effort to defend the language itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.826" offset="10660049">Two, lack of guidance to the enforcing authorities leaving them with uncontrolled discretion and thirdly where statutes affect to First Amendment rights, it must be narrowly drawn to save this from the vice of overbreadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.820" offset="10711980">And a statute which violates anyone of these values should be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.081" offset="10729117">Now the Government’s principle argument regarding a projecting is that the Court shouldn’t reach the statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.948" offset="10756493">And the Government’s position apparently is that if Avrech was aware that his conduct was prohibited by Article 134 that ends the question of vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.095" offset="10797140">Although, we don’t concede that Avrech in effect had fair warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.285" offset="10813858">The fallacy of the Government’s argument is that it completely ignores the second value which is a lack of standards to guide the enforcing authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.403" offset="11106325">They argue in the brief at least that there’s a custom in practice in the military as to what offenses are covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.012" offset="12520803">Now, the Government suggests that apart from what the manual represents as a repository of custom in practice that the manual gives fair warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.051" offset="12560927">Now the inadequacy of this is as I have shown with regard to custom in practice that the Court of Military Appeals has frequently held that offenses which are not covered can still be charged under 134.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.010" offset="12600738">In addition, new offenses are added every single time you have new additions of the manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.188" offset="12629473">As a matter of fact the disloyalty provision here was added in 1951 after the Uniform Code of Military Justice was enacted and you cannot say here that there was any considered legislative judgment that this particular type of conduct should be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.447" offset="12710557">Now, the Government’s principal argument I think really goes to the question of what the constitutional rules of vagueness which we have been discussing had any application to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.171" offset="12761443">And the Government must offer some justification why the rules for the military should be different and it’s not enough to say just that the military is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.402" offset="12802403">This Court has always taken the approach that the party who wishes to relax constitutional principles must have the burden of showing why those principles should not apply in a particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.988" offset="12844722">And this Court indicated in Frontiero and Toth v. Quarles that this rule certainly applies to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.421" offset="12870426">And the highest military courts in Jacoby and Tentia (ph) and the lower federal court have taken that approach as well as the two Circuit Courts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.181" offset="12905430">And there are compelling reasons I think why the constitutional standards of vagueness should apply to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.200" offset="12933538">In the first case, we have people in the military who are draftees or volunteers who live their civilian life for at least a period of two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.219" offset="12965616">They give up their civilian life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.552" offset="12970945">They make sacrifices and there is absolutely no reason why with regard to knowledge, why they should not have the same protections with regard to statutes that civilians have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.005" offset="13012741">Furthermore, the uniform code of military justice is a penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.798" offset="13031967">It’s a penal statute and it is no different from any other civilian penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.037" offset="13052865">It imposes penalties, people can go to jail for this and there is no reason why different standard should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.126" offset="13077211">And the Government offers nothing here really than code words and slogan such as military necessity and instead of any analysis of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.148" offset="13121306">Now I admit that it may be convenient for the military to have a vague and overbroad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.926" offset="13152444">Indeed all enforcing authorities I am sure have come and would find it convenient to have such a broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.397" offset="13178358">To have an open-ended statute but that is precisely why this Court has struck down such statutes because you can’t give enforcing authorities wide and uncontrolled discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.161" offset="13225378">Now there are indeed with regard to Solicitor General’s argument that the military needs Article 134, I suggest to you that there at least several military man who don’t agree with that, who say that we can get by without Article 134.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.796" offset="13303954">And Chief Judge, the Army Board of Review, General Hodson said that and the Secretary of Defense own task force on the administration of justice recommend that Article I which included by the way the Judge Advocate Generals recommended that Article 134 be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.760" offset="13363827">And I suggest for any conduct that the military doesn’t like, they have a very simple solution and that’s to go to Congress and enact specific punitive articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.425" offset="13402488">They have done this before and Uniform Code of Military Justice was adopted in 1949.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.551" offset="14202984">No, I don’t think, I think as a practical matter, the way that cover this type of conduct is to enact specific punitive articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.673" offset="14239451">In the few moments remaining, I would just like to discuss the question of overbreadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.515" offset="14270798">Article 134, the Government concedes at least in its brief reaches First Amendment -- reaches First Amendment activities and the Court has struck down statutes and if Government concedes that the Court has struck down statutes on their face it would reach First Amendment activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.905" offset="14328372">The Government’s point here is that since Article 134 covers conduct outside of the First Amendment as well as within the First Amendment, this Court should not consider the statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.305" offset="14369959">Now the Government cites no case for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.498" offset="14378736">Frankly, I know of no case holding that because a statute can cover all types of conduct, it should be held overbroad because it impinges on the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.278" offset="14413845">This statute because it is all embraced it covers a whole variety of activity including First Amendment activities and is therefore overbroad and should be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.237" offset="14453656">Thank you.</text>
