            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments next in number 72-481, State of Washington against the Puyallup Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.850" offset="168124">Mr. Coniff, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Coniff, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="25.525" offset="178887">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.833" offset="192052">My name is Joseph Laurence Coniff Jr. I am an Assistant Attorney General from the State of Washington and I am here representing the Washington Department of Game.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.679" offset="231445">As I am sure, the Court is aware, this is the second time that this particular matter has been before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.162" offset="257358">The previous occasion was of course in 1968 and the Court had occasion to render its opinion in this matter in 391 U.S. 392.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.984" offset="300722">This case basically involves a further clarification of the treaty language, Indian Treaty Language pertaining to off reserve claim, off reservation Indian Fishing Rights and I would like to preliminary note to the Court's information that at the time that this litigation was commenced in 1963, at both the Washington Department of Game and Washington Department of Fisheries were party’s plaintiff and adopted the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.477" offset="422661">However, I have been instructed to advise the Court that the Washington Department of Fisheries has not sought review of the lower court opinion, which is now before you, but that the Washington in Department of Game has authorized and instructed me to file the petition for certiorari, which of course the court has granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.024" offset="496849">I should also advise you that the Washington Department of Fisheries position as contrasted to the Washington Department of Games position has predicated upon its reading of this Court’s prior opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.437" offset="550452">The fishery's position appears to be predicated upon the concept of granting to Indian, Treaty Indians, special Indian only commercial netting seasons for salmon in the fresh water streams of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.065" offset="608967">It is the position of the Washington Department of Game before this Court that the position of our sister agency is incorrect and is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.481" offset="646687">Because a state law prohibits the use of this type of set net or commercial netting gear on the catching of anadromous fish of which both salmon and steelhead are anadromous fish in off reservation waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.370" offset="706247">And in reality, the position which has been adapted by the fisheries department and which is closely parallel by the Federal Government’s position in this case before the court is predicated upon the assumption that the state administrative agency director has the authority by regulation to issue a regulation authorizing activity, which the state legislature has prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.188" offset="801541">And it is game’s position that a fair reading of this Court’s opinion in Puyallup Wan and in particularly the language utilized by Justice Douglas who wrote for unanimous court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.845" offset="856085">And the concluding paragraph of that opinion which emphasizes the equal protection concepts implicit in the Treaty Fishing Clause Language.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.228" offset="889626">That language is that the right to fish in off reservation waters, at usual and accustomed places outside reservation boundaries is one which might be exercised in common with all of the citizens of the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.124" offset="953260">And Justice Douglas speaking for the court, emphasized the equal protection concepts implicit in that language, and it is game’s position before this Court that the equal protection concepts implicit in the treaty language itself require a reversal of the Lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.488" offset="1030687">In other words gentlemen, the line of demarcation should be the reservation boundaries and that once that an Indian, reservation Indian moves outside of the reservation boundaries into off reservation areas that he is fully subject and amenable to the jurisdiction and enforcement if you will of State Conversation Laws, Rules and Regulations, pertaining to the taking of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.085" offset="1149074">And this would include salmon as well as steelhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.336" offset="1166106">I believe that our position, I mean game’s position is further sustained by the opinion of this Court in the Mescalero Apache decision versus Franklin Jones which is 41 Law week 4451.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.247" offset="1249698">This decision I feel is of very critical importance to the legal position which has been taken by the Department of Game, before the court, and that deals with off reservation activities on part of the Indian tribe in the State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.484" offset="1330678">And the facts of the case are, that the Mescalero tribe pursuant to a Federal program constructed a ski enterprise in an off reservation location.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.621" offset="1379265">And the argument was that the state of New Mexico could not impose its taxing laws to this particular enterprise and this court citing interestingly enough the Puyallup decision held that the absent Federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have been generally held subject to non-discriminatory state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.031" offset="1472888">Otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state, See Puyallup Tribe versus the Department of Game and a series of other cases, and I think the following languages in that paragraph is sufficiently important to call it and emphasize it to the court’s attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.779" offset="1551882">In discussing racehorse, it states that principle, the racehorse principle is as relevant to a states tax law as it is to state criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.105" offset="1593156">See the case and applies as much to tribal ski resorts as it does to fishing enterprises citing village of Kate v. Igen (ph).</text>

            <text syncTime="404.072" offset="1693048">Our concern in this case is to try to ascertain the meaning of those particular words and that particular treaty rather than be guided by the general kind of rules to which you have been referring us?</text>

            <text syncTime="419.292" offset="1753966">Well, I don’t believe Ward v. Racehorse is the kind of general language that you are referring too.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.141" offset="1773296">That the facts of Ward v. Racehorse involved a treaty with comparable language, involving I believe it was the Vanic Tribe in the State of Utah and this is of course an older decision of the court, but I believe that it has been revitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.224" offset="1825646">And that particular case happen to involve hunting instead of fishing, but I think that the same type of language was involved.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="443.528" offset="1850828">No, that’s not the type of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.842" offset="1856157">It is really the particular words of a particular treaty is it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Coniff, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="448.372" offset="1870263">Yes, well that my point is Your Honor the treaty involved in Ward v. Racehorse is so close to the Isaac I. Stevens Treaties that were confronted with in the State of Washington that the court’s revitalization, if you will of the equal footing doctrine of Ward v. Racehorse, I believe to be extremely significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.966" offset="1944660">And that is why I was pointing out this Court’s reliance, and I believe that revitalization of the Ward v. Racehorse doctrine.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="475.791" stopTime="479.484">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="475.791" offset="1979873">What is the equal footing doctrine? How is it treated in Puyallup 1?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_l_coniff_jr" startTime="479.484" stopTime="596.023">
            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Coniff, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="479.484" offset="1994710">It was not treated in Puyallup 1 except, as I understand the final paragraphs of that opinion as authored by Justice Douglas which indicated that the final resolution of the problem, which the court did not reach in that opinion, should include the equal protection concepts implicit in the treaty language in common with the citizens of the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.080" offset="2089064">Now, I would submit that the question certainly is not foreclosed at this time, particularly in light of this Court’s decision in the Mescalero case and the citation of Ward, and I believe I am certainly not -- I am sure when I say equal footing, we all know what I am talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.658" offset="2155416">So, I am not going to go back and try to run that one through again unless you want me to.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.786" offset="2175896">But, I think it is extremely important and I think it is important when we keep in mind that in 1854 and 55, the Indians who were residents in Washington territory with whom Governor Stevens was ordered to treat were not citizens, and I think that the civil war, obviously has not been fought, the Fourteenth Amendment lay in the unforeseeable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.421" offset="2274429">It of course was not adapted until 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.100" offset="2293133">And so when we look at the actual positions of the parties, the American Commissioner is on the one side and the Indian people on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.569" offset="2335033">The Indians were being asked to move to a place where they would have exclusive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.426" offset="2354469">They do have exclusive rights within their reservation boundaries and so far as the taking of fishing game is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.427" offset="2382472">This is conceded and as far as I am aware, this has always been the position that my clients have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.040" offset="2404937">We have no jurisdiction and no authority to go into within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation and enforce any state conversation laws, rules or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.276" offset="2449868">And we do not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.396" offset="2458331">So when we --</text>

            <text syncTime="635.572" offset="2619037">I believe that it is true in some instances, generally with some of the larger tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.222" offset="2637636">But I would point out to the court that there are over 40 some odd tribes listed in the preambles to the governor, the five governor Isaac I. Stevens Treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.790" offset="2675879">And that some of these tribes were in reality small villages in 1855, and so some of the memberships and some of the groups that are claiming these rights within the State of Washington at this time are very small rather, if you will, fragmented organizations without any real cohesive, political or governmental authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.708" offset="2751530">So, when we say the word Indians, you still have to take it a step further in terms of your analysis it’s apples and oranges when you get down to the reality on the riverbank.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.471" offset="2794684">I do wanted to -- I did want to make a point very clear however for the record that we are not here discussing any attempted entrenchment if you will, of any self government or any on reservation activity on the part of any Indian tribe in the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.494" offset="5430753">I still maintain before the court that what should be relevant but what were the relative circumstances of the parties read the entire instrument as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.476" offset="5470668">Keeping in mind the exclusive nature of the rights, which were to be granted and confirmed to the Indian tribes in terms of their on reservation fishing, and hunting activities, and the contrast in that with the off reservation in common with language, keeping in mind the fact that Indians were not citizens at that time, and keeping in mind that this language does appear in another context in that Article III of the treaty with the Yakima and that should the court reach a result in interpreting in common with to mean exclusive paramount or prior in some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.279" offset="5597832">So that they have a right to catch these fish perhaps superior to all other citizens that they may be able to catch all the fish and the citizens not any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.475" offset="5630642">Then suppose at that point, Your Honor that then these considerations that you have mentioned of the extent of the contribution to the resource by public funds would become relevant and important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.513" offset="5682782">But unless, I believe that you have to first answer or reach the question of some sort of quantification and it is only at that point that you would then begin to judicially inquire into well, -- perhaps the native runs would not be as high with absent the contribution of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.577" offset="5787063">And I might add that the Federal Government for that matter to the resource in form of fish passage facilities at dams, stream plants, projects, hatchery programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.741" offset="5843696">I just mentioned the Washington Department of Game, our lowest study shows that on the Puyallup with the lowest contribution in a single year, I believe was 60% running as high as 80% of total catch developed from our hatching program, which for the most part is financed by the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.390" offset="5910256">Approximately 80% financed by the sale of fishing licenses of steelhead punch cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.445" offset="5930527">So, the sportsman himself are -- you might say paying for a large part of the resource, but I still maintain that we do not reach this question unless we first have reached the fundamental question of what is it that was secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.762" offset="5999804">It is my primary argument to you to that level rather than to the level that you have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.378" offset="6018299">Although in my brief, I will admit I do take an alternative position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.509" offset="6070753">There is a recent opinion post to Puyallup and post to Mescalero a copy of which I passed to be you at large with clerk of the court entitled Settler v. Yakima Tribal Council, or excuse me, Yakima Tribe Court was issued by the Federal District Court for the Federal District -- the Eastern District of Washington by the honorable George H. Powell on September 26, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.868" offset="6180258">This is the only decision that I am aware of on a federal level, which deals with Puyallup and Mescalero and the issue before the court, it is not obviously in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.938" offset="6232503">As I mentioned the copiously lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.300" offset="6237936">The issue before the court was whether or not the Yakimas passed a regulation pertaining to off reservation fishing by Yakima Indians on the Columbia River, and then went down on the river and arrested a couple of members of the tribe who were violating those regulations for about 60 miles off the reservation,got them back and try to convict them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.536" offset="6334903">The issue then was whether or not they had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.851" offset="6356114">The Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Washington relying on the Puyallup-Mescalero rationale held that the Yakimas do not have extra territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.598" offset="6403135">I know that white light is on and I would like to if I may reserve the two or three moments remaining to me for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.957" offset="6468545">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.270" offset="6501878">I want to start out by saying that I think the Department of Game's position is contrary to its own State Court's finding, contrary to its own Department Fisheries position, tries to take out nothing at all, just out of air on argument that would eradicate the Third Article of the treaty with the Puyallup’s and it would jeopardize almost every Indian treaty in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.841" offset="6632072">The idea when a state comes in to the state that it can then ignore whatever treaty had been made by the United States prior to the time that it came into the state because other states did not have treaties with Indians and this would have to be equal footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.631" offset="6703229">But before I get into that in much detail, I want to say I also think that it's based on total misunderstanding of this Court’s prior decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.581" offset="6755056">Mr. Coniff argues that this Court’s prior decision in this case because of the one phrase that in determining whether the regulation is necessary for conservation you should take into account the issue of equal protection, implicit in the phrase in common with means that whatever law is the state passes that labels as conservation laws apply equally to the Indians and non-Indians in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.428" offset="6878459">That is the exact position that this Court rejected when it affirmed the decision below in the prior Puyallup case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.898" offset="6912313">What had happened there, this was the position that Mr. Coniff had argued in the Lower Court in the State of Washington in 1963, I think it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.251" offset="6961737">The Supreme Court in the State of Washington in 1967 rejected that position and held that the essence of this opinion is and the decree as reframed just so reflect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.530" offset="7046896">One if a defendant proves that he is a member of the Puyallup tribe and two, he is fishing at one of the usual and accustomed fishing places of that tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.905" offset="7080333">Three, he cannot be restrained or enjoined from doing so unless he is in violation of a statute or regulation that the department has promulgated there under which has been established to be reasonable and necessary for the conservation of the fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.451" offset="7142504">And when this Court had the case, it made perfectly clear I think that the issue was, the issue was the following that in the treaty, the tribe reserved for itself the right to fishing off reservation, but it limited that right and that it is fishing in common with the people of this state and the court --</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.626" offset="8263262">Well let me say this, the record of this case doesn’t show that it was with a gill net.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.447" offset="8290534">Indians in that general area did fish with gill nets before the white man came and there is a statement to that effect in the book called the Kroever in the Indians of the Northwest Coast, which describes how they made the nets and how the big nets were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.925" offset="8364408">It is not the gill nets and not an invention of the white man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.206" offset="8393561">I think a good deal of what Mr. Coniff has argued were the same points that where argued in the Wyman’s case in 1905 and that where rejected in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.818" offset="8451971">I want to take a minute on that and then I want to get into the questions of this present regulations and what this has to do with the conservation of fish today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.408" offset="8494393">To start of with, when the treaty was made, this treaty like, treaty with Yakamas with all the treaties Northwest Coast did three things: they start with peaceful treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.882" offset="8548310">Governor Stevens was sent in to negotiate with the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.394" offset="8566282">In each treaty, there is a clause in which the Indians cede to the United States a very large section of land that they had occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.926" offset="8600451">There is a second clause in which the Indians reserve to themselves a very small piece of land on which they were to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.220" offset="8637649">And there is a third clause in which they reserve to themselves the right of fishing at all their usual and accustomed places in common with the people of the territory and the right, putting up houses and so forth to dry their fish at those places.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.639" offset="8703269">And it is quite clear that that third clause was considered necessary for them to be able to maintain themselves if the land they were giving up was large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.988" offset="8740676">The land they were keeping was too small for them to make a living on and the treaty was negotiated in a kind of jargon, it was called a Chinook jargon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.651" offset="8791353">There is also evidence in the first record here that the treaty was translated to the Indians in very simple terms and what it obviously meant to them was that they had to give up the big land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.855" offset="8852167">They had to live on the smaller land but they could continue to fish at the usual places that they could fish but that they were no longer have that exclusive right that the settlers would be able to fish there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.393" offset="8902322">It is just -- there is nothing in it that said they submitted to regulation by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.796" offset="8923951">There is noting in it that said we want to be sport fisherman and go out and angle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.049" offset="8940983">They were fishing to feed their families and to trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.438" offset="8954462">And since that time, they continued to fish that way except when the state has prohibited them from fishing that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.994" offset="8980689">Now, in United States versus Winans, 1905, Winans was a landowner who had set up a fish wheel to make a large commercial fishery on the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.073" offset="9033038">It was under license with, from the state and also under state law no one would have the right to come on his land anyway to fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.365" offset="9066162">Winans argued that all the treaty means is that Indians must obey all the fishing laws of the state and if they do, they can then continue to fish but they had no special treaty right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.903" offset="9120392">And Winans argued this case of Ward versus Racehorse that had been decided seven or eight years before that and that Mr. Coniff relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.158" offset="9149336">He said, the treaty may have been fine for the old days but when Washington came into this state, this Indians lost any special right that they had prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.198" offset="9193535">And this Court strongly rejected both of those arguments in the Winans case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.588" offset="9223105">The Court explained that the right to fish was part of the right and I quote here, “not much less necessary to the Indians than the atmosphere they breathe.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.200" offset="9273574">The Court said that in ceding most of their land, they did not cede their fishing rights, but only limited them to be no longer exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.375" offset="9306279">And that to interpret those rights retained as giving them nothing more than they would have without the treaty would be in the words of the Court an impotent outcome to negotiations and the convention that would seem to promise more and to give the word of the nation for more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.188" offset="9377541">The Court also said, the right was intended to be continuing against the United States and its grantees as well as against the state and its grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.307" offset="9426024">In Tully versus Washington in 1942, Justice Black for the Court in the same vain strongly supported the specialness of these Indian fishing rights and the right of their right to fish even without paying for a commercial fishing license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.642" offset="9499272">Still that was argued to the court as a conservation requirement, to have them pay the commercial fishing license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.321" offset="9529992">Justice Black said, even though this method maybe both convenient and its general impact fair, it acts upon the Indians as a charge for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.092" offset="9589133">It cannot be reconciled with a fair construction of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.794" offset="9603971">We therefore hold that the state and hold the state statute invalid as applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.547" offset="9630929">Now, Justice Douglas in the prior Puyallup case cited both those cases with approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.680" offset="9663425">He stated that the Court say that he would not say the fishing regulation had to be indispensable for conservation, but they would say it had to be necessary for conservation and they could not discriminate against the Indians and then remanded the case for trial on the issue of whether these regulations were --</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.239" offset="10021721">They said, we will prohibit the fishery at the mouth of the river where the fish mill over and over and over and we will prohibit the fishery 20 miles upstream where the fish are actually spawning and where people are walking around there with nets would be destructive to the fish.</text>
