            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">In number 72-1264, Mayor of Philadelphia against Education Equality League, we have a case that comes to us on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.393" offset="158302">In Philadelphia under a complicated provision of the City Charter, the Mayor appoints a school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.246" offset="197695">The charter provides, however, for a nominating panel which is required to submit to the Mayor, three nominees for every they can see on the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.134" offset="245238">The Mayor must make appointment to the board from among those nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.538" offset="270942">The nominating panel consists of 13 members, all appointed by the Mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.371" offset="298214">Four may be appointed from the citizen they oblige; each of the remaining members must be the highest ranking officer of designated categories of citywide organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.989" offset="360699">The respondents have said the Mayor violated the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against Negros in his appointment to the 1971 nominating panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.615" offset="415242">In that year, the panel was composed of 11 whites and 2 Negros.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.637" offset="439275">The school board itself, as to which no discrimination is alleged, was then composed of seven whites and two Negros.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.913" offset="484415">And when this case was argued there were six whites and three Negros on the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.226" offset="517642">Some 34% of the population of Philadelphia and 60% of the students in the public schools were Negros.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.784" offset="555886">Following a hearing, the District Court found no discrimination and dismissed the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.611" offset="583158">The Court of Appeals, however, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.985" offset="596637">We hold, based upon an examination of the record, that the findings and conclusions of the District Court were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.858" offset="636134">We conclude that the factors, relied upon by the Court of Appeals, were insufficient to support a conclusion of discrimination, especially with respect to the discretionary appointment by an elected official of a small body, such as a school board or a nominating panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.821" offset="732056">The evidence in this case is too fragmentary and speculative to support such a serious triage.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.527" offset="766851">Accordingly, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.414" offset="786390">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan and Marshall fully concurred and in part of which Mr. Justice Douglas concurred.</text>
