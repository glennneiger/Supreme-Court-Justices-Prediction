            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We'll hear arguments next in Number 72-1557, Speight against Slaton.</text>

            <text syncTime="15.725" offset="139598">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.615" offset="155167">This case originated prior to the decisions by this court in June of 1973, and so the District Court was not in the position to being guided by the wisdom of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.475" offset="210651">However, it does come from the same jurisdiction and is one of the cases, it was (Inaudible), it was argued by Mr. Moran and myself before this court, and which was decided in June of ’73.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.569" offset="263001">In this particular case, the State of Georgia proceeded under a civil type of proceeding to entirely close an adult bookstore on the concept that during a particular period of time, approximately one-year period before the action was brought, that certain publications were offered for sale which in the opinion of the solicitor were considered to be or should've been considered to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.232" offset="369685">During that entire time prior to the bringing of the civil action, only one case was in fact brought to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.761" offset="403749">That criminal case ended in a hung jury, I think it was 4-1 that are being a 5-man jury system, and ended in a hung jury, 4-1 and mistrial was declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.892" offset="452336">So we had the situation which none of the publications, by virtue of the criminal process, had been declared to be obscene by a jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="102.259" stopTime="107.918">

            <text syncTime="103.038" offset="488908">Did the jury announced their vote when they had a hung trial in Georgia?</text>

            <text syncTime="110.139" offset="517329">But in this case, they did indicate that they were hung and that it was 4-1.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.897" offset="560379">Oh! If it isn't in the record, we're not interested in it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="125.368" offset="578247">It was recognized or admitted by the States, Your Honor, at the time of the proceedings before the three-judge court and was noted specially in the opinion of Just -- Judge Morgan who dissented from the three-judge opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.125" offset="629238">So to that extent, it's in the record, whether it is stenographically recorded or not, I don't know.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="143.007" offset="648777">Is there anything involved, which do you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_smith" startTime="144.927" stopTime="284.146">
            <label>Mr. Robert Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="144.927" offset="656405">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.567" offset="659017">I would though -- think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.573" offset="667063">In this particular case, after not having succeeded in that particular action, they went about to bring an action to close the store in its entirety to stop the store from -- the people from operating the store from selling anything at all in that store.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.197" offset="729548">There was no concept that everything in the store was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.305" offset="749923">I think the allegations in the complaint originally filed by the State of Georgia was that a substantial part or a large part of the material offered for sale they felt could be or would be deemed to be obscene under the Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.403" offset="806348">Now, this was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.302" offset="817946">We sought the intervention of a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.207" offset="829544">And the opinion of the three-judge court was, in essence, opinions by each of the three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.439" offset="858488">The first was Judge Muys who, writing for the Court concurred in by a Judge, Circuit -- District Court Judge O’Kelley, thought that one of the issues why they should not seek to go forward in this case was because this was a new statute and the new statute had not been construed by a -- by the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.311" offset="941976">That's first, but second and more compelling was a decision of the Circuit Court in Peoli versus McKolf.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.336" offset="974054">In that case, the petition in the Fifth Circuit, this -- that case had not been appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.140" offset="1001326">In that case, the Fifth Circuit held that federal anticipatory relief would be inappropriate in that -- this case and we are to meet no view as to appellant’s challenges to the State Court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.147" offset="1053362">They did so under the concept of the fact that it was a quasi criminal proceeding that it was, in essence in aid of enforcement of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.638" offset="1095262">There, there was attempted seizure of films, specific films, main films, which were to be utilized in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.055" offset="1124937">And, a criminal proceeding was brought before the appeal was argued in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.284" offset="1149910">In to these circumstances what we had is that, at the time of the argument, the Fifth Circuit, the decision -- a criminal case had been brought, this was pending and, before the decision by the Fifth Circuit, the State Supreme Court ruled that the seizure had been proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.600" offset="1275193">And absent in that determination, as I said, they went ahead and filed the nuisance action.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.333" offset="1306122">Mr. Jonathan, the --  Judge Morgan has addressed himself to that in his dissenting opinion and points out the differences in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.403" offset="1346351">Now in the Peoli case which we indicated, that case related to a specific film.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.518" offset="1370802">Now in 80 Drive-in Inc. versus Baxley which was decided after the Peoli case the panel said that, unlike Peoli versus McKolf, this case presents squarely the question where the Younger v. Harris precludes federal intervention in purely civil proceedings as well as state criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.313" offset="1446034">But because we affirm the judgment of the District Court on other grounds, we intimate no resolution of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.693" offset="1467559">So, they did not -- they clearly indicated they did not resolve that question, of course --</text>

            <text syncTime="354.544" offset="1494936">It's a different panel and, as I said, they indicated that they had not resolved that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.228" offset="1521685">Now, after, as we said, we filed this matter, Judge Morgan, Judge O’Kelley, in a concurring opinion which was separate, indicated that there had been no allegations of bad faith enforcement of the law or harassment, and we say that the complaint does support such allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.539" offset="1606949">We did, in fact, make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.536" offset="1614890">We did, in fact, have an affidavit by counsel setting forth specific allegations to this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.798" offset="1639967">And so, we say Judge O’Kelley had overlooked that particular concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.400" offset="1654387">Now with regard to the specifics here, the -- since this Court has decided a -- decisions on June 21, 1973, nuisance actions had been brought and prosecuted in various other jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.217" offset="1721574">This court has before it now a case involving Pursue Limited -- Hawkman versus Pursue Limited involving the question of nuisance and whether or not the store can be entirely closed because it's operated and sells a single publication which might be deemed to be obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.783" offset="1803912">And, as Judge Morgan points out in his dissent that acting under this statute, agents of the State of Georgia which are not successful in criminal prosecution could aviate the criminal prosecution and go forth, and because one publication might be declared obscene in a civil proceeding by a single judge the entire store could be closed and nothing could be sold.</text>
