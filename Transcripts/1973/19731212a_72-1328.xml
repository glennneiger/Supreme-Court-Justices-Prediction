            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">Mr. Frey, I think you have about 15 minutes remaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="8.361" offset="110237">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.017" offset="128836">I think I was about to start yesterday with the discussion of Judge Campbell’s order authorizing the wire interception in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.431" offset="166452">The Court of Appeals read the order as though it was limited until the interception of conversations of Irving Kahn with persons unknown, that is, only conversations between Irving and persons unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.860" offset="228206">In fact, the order read conversations of Irving Kahn and others as yet unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.015" offset="256836">We submit that it’s clear as Judge Stevens indicated in his dissent that that would authorize the interception of all the conversations that are in issue in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="57.408" stopTime="76.953">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="57.408" offset="306364">I take it, you mean by that that if some sort of meeting were held in his home, in Kahn’s home, and other members of the organization handling it were present, their use of the phone would be covered by this authorization?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="76.953" stopTime="95.567">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="76.953" offset="384522">Yes, certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.635" offset="395285">Any conversations over those phones relating to the gambling offenses would be covered by the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.286" offset="417855">This is a standard form of language that wire interception orders almost routinely, contained where there’s not any special restriction that’s intended to be imposed on the scope of the reception.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="95.567" stopTime="121.639">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="95.567" offset="459024">Would you think the warrant where the authorization would be adequate if there were persons then known to the Government who were working as part of this group with Kahn and, yet, not identified in the warrant but if they came to his house and used his phone?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="121.639" stopTime="289.102">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="121.639" offset="563304">Well, let me begin by saying that, as a constitutional matter, I think there is no requirement of identifying the person so long as the conversation so identified was sufficient particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.005" offset="608758">Now, Justice White was touching on this question yesterday whether, as a statutory matter, Congress intended some sanction or suppression to result from such a laps on the Government’s part.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.443" offset="666540">Now, I think that the consequence of saying that after the interception has been completed and the prosecution is broad, and these are frequently, highly complex prosecutions with numerous defendants involving a far-reaching conspiracy, the Government should not be put to the proof of showing with respect to every conversation that it did in some way or somehow, have a probable cause that somebody could dredge up on the basis of which they might have anticipated intercepting the conversations of some individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.014" offset="796839">So, I think it would be our position that as long as you name the primary target of the investigation whose zone of privacy you’re expecting to intrude upon which, in this case, would be Irving Kahn and his household telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.323" offset="866011">That that should suffice and that, then all unlawful conversations over the phone can be intercepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.482" offset="898717">Now, the statute is quite clear and the Court of Appeals, in referring to the statute, did not fully quote it in discussing this “if known” problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.281" offset="953887">Section 2518 (1) provides that the order of the application for the wire interception order shall contain certain information.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.813" offset="999967">In Subsection (b) (iv), it requires -- the Government indicates “the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose conversations are to be intercepted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="243.940" offset="1052526">Now, two things emerge from this provision with, we submit, indisputable clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.953" offset="1076558">The first is that it concerns persons if known to be committing the offense, and not just persons who are known in some other broader or vaguer sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.834" offset="1120131">The second is that the statute contemplates circumstances in which no one may be known and, therefore, no one need be named yet, nevertheless, the Government may apply for and obtain from a judge an order authorizing a wire interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.862" offset="1180212">That might be the case, say, if you had a cigar store or a pool hall where you knew gambling or drug business was being conducted over telephone but you did not know the identities of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.525" offset="1302883">Well, we begin with there being no constitutional requirement for this identification and then we look to see whether the statute has imposed requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.248" offset="1769744">As they are now and there was an explanation which was the typical recitation of what they provide with, aside to a case called West against Cabell, which dealt with arrest warrants and not with search warrants and -- which is a little difficult to understand why it was even referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.429" offset="1850514">Now, there is a legitimate concern with the problem of intercepting innocent conversations and conversations of innocent persons who may be in the household or who otherwise may be calling in or out from the intercepted telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.627" offset="1911223">But I think it’s clear that Congress anticipated that this was inevitable and that indeed, any wire interception must necessarily entail some limited degree of interception of innocent persons or innocent conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.428" offset="1974439">I’d like to give some examples of some typical conversations which I think will make this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.856" offset="2000144">First of all, we have -- the phone rings and, let’s say, Mrs. Kahn picks up the phone and says “hello.”</text>
            <text syncTime="489.594" offset="2035148">Now, at this point, the question is should the people monitoring simply turn the recording off right away because it’s not Irving Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.136" offset="2069316">Well, I think the answer to that is quite clear because the next -- and the answer is, clearly, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.688" offset="2087497">They can’t turn it off at that point because the next words may be “Is Irving at home?”</text>
            <text syncTime="508.782" offset="2111843">“Yes, I’ll put him right on the phone.”</text>
            <text syncTime="511.733" offset="2123651">Now, if they can listen past the hello, past the time that Minnie Kahn gets on the phone, the next question may be or the next statement may be “I’d like to bet $500 on the Bears.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.354" offset="2174119">What’s the spread?” and she may say “Well, it’s 5 points, but you owe us $1,000 and we can’t take any more bets from you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="533.717" offset="2211631">Well, since they have to be allowed to hear this far into the conversation, once this has been monitored, lawfully monitored, there’s no policy either constitutional or statutory that could possibly be served by saying “well, they heard it but they can’t use it in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.295" offset="2285923">They can’t use it to prove the offense because they didn’t name Minnie in the order.”</text>

            <text syncTime="663.426" offset="2730423">They properly heard these conversations, and they had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.204" offset="2745574">As you can see from the examples that I’ve cited, I think there’s no basis than in a justification, no policy reasons for excluding them.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.557" offset="2782981">Now, I see my time is running short.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.841" offset="2796147">I think that I’d just like to make one or two more comments and then save the balance of my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.459" offset="2822583">The Court of Appeals suggested that somehow the Government should have conducted a further investigation of Mrs. Kahn which they thought might have disclosed her complicity in the illegal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.402" offset="2878380">We suggest, and we’ve argued this at some length in our brief, that this does not serve Mrs. Kahn’s privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.180" offset="2905443">It does not serve any privacy interest that the Fourth Amendment is designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.617" offset="2923207">Since whether or not the investigation disclosed her complicity, the interception of her conversations could still take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.257" offset="2961763">Finally, on the standing point which we also advert to in the last section of our brief, I’d simply like to cite Alderman, footnote 9, in Justice White’s opinion in Alderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.933" offset="3016516">There is a discussion of the standing problem and there is a reference to the legislative history which is at page 91 of the Senate Report 1097.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.766" offset="3063850">And it was quite clear there that the normal Fourth Amendment constitutional standing rule was intended to be adopted in these wire interception cases and, under that rule, we think it’s clear here that any defect that may have existed was purely personal to Minnie Kahn, and Irving Kahn should have no standing to raise the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.199" offset="3157577">If there are no questions at this time, I’d like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <label>Ms. Anna R. Lavin</label>
            <text syncTime="780.546" offset="3198955">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.331" offset="3222047">I don’t know that I entirely understood the latter part of counsel’s argument relative to standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.036" offset="3252872">The statute itself provides standing for any person aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.779" offset="3279830">And I think that is conclusive on who has standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.964" offset="3300624">Along with that, I would like to contest partly what the Government has stated that this Title III case does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.532" offset="3334896">It does here, contrary to what he said, have a minimization issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.939" offset="3356526">That was not ruled on in the court below as not necessary, perhaps it was somewhat ruled upon by virtue of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.565" offset="3399053">The sufficiency of the affidavit and the application are not finally settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.603" offset="3423190">It also has an issue of proper or improper authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.671" offset="3447432">In that regard, the Government indicated that we have all the normal papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.347" offset="3470106">We have got none of the affidavits to determine if this was one of the so-called now Lindenbaum cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.278" offset="3501871">This case was decided in the District Court in November of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.694" offset="3523500">The leading Robinson case referring to the Lindenbaum case affidavits was some six months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.214" offset="3561639">So, those are battles that we have yet to fight and I make reference to this only because the Government has indicated that we got all the customary papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.572" offset="3611063">Again, and this might have been a misstatement, he said that the indictment had been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.724" offset="3631647">On the contrary, that evidence has been suppressed but the indictment continues to be viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.832" offset="3672085">The trial court merely suppressed the evidence that Minnie Kahn had on her about March 21, 1970 and, particularly some conversations she had with Irving Kahn on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.266" offset="3725793">He was in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.368" offset="3730181">She was in Skokie, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.764" offset="3739794">This was at the trial court level, suppressed principally upon the husband and wife privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.135" offset="3769260">Secondly, it was suppressed on the ground that Minnie, though a known person, was not named in the authorization order.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.361" offset="3802175">Particularly, the trial court found, and this is at page 52 of the appendix in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.368" offset="3862256">Any conversations exclusively between the defendant Irving Kahn and his wife Minnie Kahn a privilege of communications and, thereby, suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.571" offset="3895066">The motion of the defendant Minnie Kahn to suppress her intercepted conversations is granted as they were not authorized by Judge Campbell’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.821" offset="3927980">The motion the defendant Irving Kahn to suppress intercepted conversations to or from his home is also granted to the extent that he did not personally participate in such conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.233" offset="3977718">Now, these three are the basis of the Government’s appeal from the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.627" offset="3999242">Now, we would refer the Court to the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.755" offset="4019722">There, we had three separate decisions. The majority holding that the non-Irving communications were not authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.317" offset="4050024">One judge agreed with the trial court that the Minnie-Irving conversations were privileged and recognized as such by the statute as privileged and should’ve been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.623" offset="4103210">Neither the tapes nor the report that was delivered to the trial court was any part of this record, I meant to the authorizing court, was any part of the record at the trial court level nor at the Court of Appeals level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.881" offset="4184294">Mr. Justice Stewart asked yesterday about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.087" offset="4205087">The answer to your question is the report about which you asked was filed in this Court for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.208" offset="4241554">There is nothing in the record to even suggest the content of the marital conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.897" offset="4272379">Now, in this posture and with due recognition that this is, I believe, the first Title III case before this Court, we have the further recognition that will be followed by more sophisticated arguments on Title III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.482" offset="4342700">We do see in this case a basic constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.418" offset="4362449">If, as the Government urges, we were to equate Title III conversations with the Fourteenth Amendment -- the Fourth Amendment, this Court has to decide whether a conversation is the equivalent of a place to be searched or whether those conversations are an incident or an element of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.229" offset="4457639">The Government’s argument tends to ask you to equate a telephone with the premises to be searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.619" offset="4491180">We submit, on the other hand, that a telephone conversation is the property of the person, not of the phone, of the person whose thoughts, whose ideas, whose reactions are reflected by that conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.994" offset="4548754">We submit that a telephone is not a premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.043" offset="4564950">It’s not an enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.902" offset="4572369">It’s not a cartilage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.258" offset="4581773">The phone retains no property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.449" offset="4590550">It’s only the wiretap that retains the personal utterances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.971" offset="4612598">In that respect, we think there’s also a quality of the Fifth Amendment in this case because the goal of the wiretap is the securing of incriminating statements of persons names in the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.707" offset="4671530">They don’t listen for innocent conversations and accidentally come across evidence or instrumentalities of crime.</text>

            <label>Ms. Anna R. Lavin</label>
            <text syncTime="1188.970" offset="4832653">Our position is that this would take us, of course, to the application and to the affidavit which we reach later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.957" offset="4872568">And that is that Mr. Kahn, at the time of this conversation, was off the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.855" offset="4912170">Now, let us assume he’s on the premises and someone else takes over the phone, and enough is heard accidentally in that case to determine that someone else is now involved with him in the gambling operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.307" offset="4974028">But under the circumstances in this case where he was not on the premises, then the information secured would not be admissible because it had not been pursuant to the order nor had it been -- nor had any order been obtained on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.726" offset="5047693">But we have to look at that in the posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.447" offset="5062531">The La Gorga case that the Government adverts to is, I think, fairly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.038" offset="5096908">In that case, two of the principals were known to visit a certain health club.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.537" offset="5126896">An order issued and it said you may listen in on the phone at the health club, but you may only listen when one or both of the known persons are on the premises and when one or the other of the known person is involved in the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.565" offset="5202965">In other words, I think the important distinction here is Mr. Kahn’s being off the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.577" offset="5251030">If I may just finish up the thought, I suggest that this is an invasion of the person, I would also suggest that Congress understood this to be an invasion of the person when it specifically excluded any privileged conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.510" offset="5326785">Now, of course, privileged conversations do not refer to premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.211" offset="5349564">They refer only to people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.226" offset="5373701">Now, I would like to go, if the Court please, to persons unknown and whether Minnie Kahn can be brought within the shelter of persons unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.805" offset="5455935">I want to refer you first, if I may, to the affidavit which is found at Page 9 of the Appendix before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.598" offset="5495118">At 3 (a), they state this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.060" offset="5509016">“There is probable cause for a belief that Irving Kahn and Jake Jacobs have been and are now committing an offense involving the use of telephone communication facilities in interstate commerce with intent to carry on the offensive waitering (ph) on sports events in violation of Illinois law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.829" offset="5588114">Then on the next page, the affidavit says, “There’s probable cause to believe the telephone numbers and the numbers at the Kahn residence and telephone numbers at the Jacob’s residence are being used and will be used in carrying out the offenses of paragraph 3 (a)", which I just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.563" offset="5682991">The affidavit continues, in effect, finding how this operation is run by Kahn and how it is run by Jacobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.432" offset="5738475">No one else is adverted to as being a part of this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.225" offset="5757597">The only persons who are referred to thereafter are bettors and linesman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.708" offset="5791556">I don’t mean linesman in the sense of football.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.343" offset="5810155">So eventually, without another word being said about parties unknown, we come to the last paragraph on Page 20 where the request is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.066" offset="5873058">It is requested, this intercept not terminate etcetera, to reveal the manner in which Irving Kahn, Jake Jacobs, and others yet unknown participate in the illegal use of interstate telephone facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.323" offset="7358067">They don’t say “the name of the person, if known, could be in the gambling business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.257" offset="7373740">They say “the name of the person, if known,” and I suggest that it’s a distortion of the plain words of the statute to amend it to say “you have to name the person if you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.660" offset="7419402">Only, you don’t have to name him if you don’t know if he’s in the business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.809" offset="7439987">The requirements of that statute, both the name of the person, if known, and the four other requirements are mandatory conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.294" offset="7481887">They are set forth in the statute, we think, to meet the precision and discrimination discussed by this Court in Katz, where this Court said that, under sufficiently precise and discriminate circumstances, a Federal Court may empower government agents to employ a concealed electronic device for the narrow and particularized purpose of ascertaining the truth of the allegations of a detailed factual affidavit alleging the commission of a particular offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.076" offset="7633084">If any of those requirements are omitted, the warrant itself loses, or rather the order itself loses precision and the discrimination that is required by this Court under Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.102" offset="7701107">Also, you don’t have the other requirement of Katz, the narrow and particularized purpose, nor are you looking here for the truth of the allegations as to whether or not Katz is running a betting operation on his premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.984" offset="7784699">This listening indiscriminately to the conversations of the children and of the wife would not lead to the end that is indicated as the purpose under the Katz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.903" offset="7904340">The Government, in its argument, in its brief -- both the brief and in its argument here, relies in great measure on the “plain view” doctrine that this Court discussed in the Coolidge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.759" offset="7975811">As that court found -- as this Court found in that case, it said that the doctrine was not applicable to a search of a particular Pontiac automobile which stood plainly in the driveway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.715" offset="8035579">We suggest that should also apply here where the search centered on Minnie Kahn, and Minnie Kahn and their two children were known occupants of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.932" offset="8096496">In Coolidge, you said the “plain view” doctrine may not be used to extend the general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emerges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.567" offset="8146965">Well, we submit to the Court that if you can’t extend from one object to another, then we don’t think you can extend from Irving Kahn to Minnie Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.300" offset="8209972">I also would take up with the Court the matter of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.739" offset="8243722">In our fourth point in our brief, we complained about the secrecy of these court-authorized interception proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.232" offset="8281652">Most particularly, we complained about having no access to files to determine in this case whether a notice in inventory was served on Minnie Kahn which we think would’ve been a recognition that Minnie Kahn was within the scope of the authorizing letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.126" offset="8349257">The Government says that Minnie wasn’t mentioned in the order and, therefore, notice in inventory need only be served upon her in the court’s discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.371" offset="8402233">We take that, of course, to admit that Minnie didn’t in fact get any notice even though it was her conversations principally, not Irving’s, on that phone that the Government intends to use to prove the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.618" offset="8467226">And even thought the Government ask this Court to unsuppress that evidence, it seems to us that this is kind of a “later day” explanation that a known person, though not known to be in a gambling business, was definitely to a person to whom this notice was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.774" offset="8575896">The Government excuses this in a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.416" offset="8590420">It says Minnie Kahn received a notice sent to Irving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.510" offset="8606824">Now, that’s a little off the record, but I’m willing to assume the validity of that representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.248" offset="8637753">All the cases of which we are aware indicate that this notice is made by a registered mail and, for the purpose of this we will assume that Minnie received the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.186" offset="8705463">But the Government asks the Court further to assume, first, that Minnie opened the mail or that Irving is presumed to have told Minnie what was in the letter from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.350" offset="8758126">I think that’s untenable that while wives do not invariably open husband’s mail and husbands do not tell wives they’re having trouble with the Government until they’re forced to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.486" offset="8814655">The Ianella case on which the Government relies has no force here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.338" offset="8834090">In that case, the other persons were actually unknown persons, unknown at the time they put in the wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.747" offset="8871706">This person using the phone to the exclusion of the named person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.758" offset="8895739">We would then refer the court to the Third Circuit Eastman case at 465 F. 2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.945" offset="8928549">There, a suppression order issued and it was affirmed for failure to give the statutory notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.335" offset="8962090">In that case, they relied principally in this Court’s decision in Berger which cast down a New York eavesdropping statute for failure to provide for the giving of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.404" offset="9018410">In this case, though the bulk of the conversations were Minnie’s, the Government would have us read this statute that notice need not be given to Minnie from whom the property was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.269" offset="9077864">We suggest to the Court that that does not equate with the Fourth Amendment even if it does equate with the literal reading of 2518 (8) (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.498" offset="9126766">If that Section can be so narrowly construed, like a person from whom the telephone calls were taken need not be given notice, then it doesn’t meet the requirements of this court’s decision in Berger and, under such a construction, we would submit that the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.874" offset="9232196">I see that my time is going and I would just like to refer the Court to the Government cited case, the United States versus La Gorga at 365 F. 2d or rather F. 7h.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.113" offset="9293218">It gives us a background against which the legislature intended Title III to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.664" offset="9323416">And in speaking of the privacy insured by the Fourth Amendment, it said that privacy can be breached by a search warrant under conditions set out in the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.703" offset="9367510">Factually, the wiretapping permitted by the Omnibus Crime Control Act is severely limited and the Act actually prohibits far more wiretapping than it permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.117" offset="9425189">I submit then to the Court, in closing, that wiretapping and any expansion on the order should be given a negative rather than a positive reception and should be countenanced only in circumstances that clearly warranted, and this is not such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.186" offset="9521528">We urge the Court to affirm the decision of the Seventh Circuit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="2368.403" offset="9550367">A few things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.409" offset="9566354">First of all, of course, I’d like to point out that there’s no Fifth Amendment problem in this case since there was no compelled statement or testimony of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.136" offset="9605329">Secondly, with respect to the La Gorga case, the Health Club case that counsel adverted to, public phones, phones in public places are different from phones in a private home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.331" offset="9658096">Katz case involved a public phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.113" offset="9665202">There was, indeed, an amendment proposed to Congress to this Bill and which was recommended by the Justice Department but which was never voted on or adopted which, in the case of public phones, would’ve permitted only the interception of conversations of the named party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.539" offset="9734896">For obvious reasons, you would have no basis for expecting to receive any information relating to your investigation from conversations on a public phone except by those of the named party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.370" offset="9778260">That is not at all true in this situation where you’re intercepting conversations over a private phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.751" offset="9807726">Frequently, in these cases, there are organized crime cases; you’re dealing with sophisticated conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.267" offset="9833848">It’s not uncommon particularly in narcotics cases to have two quite innocent people start a conversation and then, in the middle of the conversation, all of a sudden you have two completely different people who are on the phone talking in code about narcotics transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.725" offset="9891631">In this case, indeed, some of the conversations were in Yiddish between Irving and Minnie Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.692" offset="9927471">With respect to what’s in the record and what isn’t in the record that is a little confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.427" offset="9950459">The record in the wire interception authorization proceeding, which is technically a civil proceeding, was sealed and it did go up to the Court of Appeals, and technically, the tapes of the recordings were part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.346" offset="10018168">In fact, I think neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals listened to any of the conversations or relied upon the content of any of the conversations, the specific content, in reaching its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.142" offset="10073339">Now, the notice issue which counsel discussed is, of course, not before this Court or was not involved in the grant of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.428" offset="10122449">Moreover, it’s clear that the District Court has discretion to require notice, service of the inventory notice, except to the named party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.687" offset="10171455">Here, the named party was Irving Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.342" offset="10178142">He received service of the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.416" offset="10190367">There was no defect in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.250" offset="10205727">And finally, with respect to the standing point, it is true that the statute defines a person aggrieved quite broadly for standing purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.292" offset="10245956">But we’ve indicated in our brief our position, we think this is supported by the discussion in Alderman, that the target of the interception, the person whose phone is being intercepted is conferred broad standing for the purpose of challenging the legality of the entry onto his telephone line just as the home owner is conferred broad standing for the purpose of challenging the entry into his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.214" offset="10357656">If something illegal inside his house or on the line is found but only affects another person, he should not be granted standing to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.395" offset="10390361">Therefore, we submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
