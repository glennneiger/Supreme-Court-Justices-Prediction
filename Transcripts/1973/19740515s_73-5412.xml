            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">Dillard against the Industrial Commission of Virginia is an appeal from a three-judge court in the Eastern District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.729" offset="119641">The appellants there have been receiving workmen's compensation benefits as approved by the Industrial Commission of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.817" offset="156003">Their benefits were suspended pursuant to a rule of the commission upon a showing of probable cause that the disability had terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.284" offset="201874">Although, the suspension order was ex-parte and without notice, the rules of the commission assured a full administrative hearing on the merits prior to any final termination of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.521" offset="266867">Appellants claim a denial of procedural due process with respect to the interim suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.193" offset="301558">In our consideration of this case, it appeared to the Court that persons aggrieved by such a suspension, need not await the full administrative hearing, but may obtain prompt enforcement of the original award by going directly to the appropriate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.409" offset="382433">If this reading of the Virginia law is correct, it's unnecessary to address the Federal constitutional question presented to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.365" offset="422243">Accordingly, the judgment is vacated and the case remanded to the District Court for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.301" offset="453904">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
