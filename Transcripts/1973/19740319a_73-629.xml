            <label>Mr. Dwight C. Pettay, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="29.897" offset="196336">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.842" offset="212114">This case concerns the continuing conflict between the State’s power to tax and the prohibition from taxing exports contained in the Import-Export Clause, which is Article I, Section 10, Clause 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.481" offset="282645">This case originated by the Tax Commissioner of Ohio issuing a tangible personal property tax assessment against National Cash Register (NCR) and issuing it against their international inventories which were located and resting in Dayton, Ohio on a tax listing date which was December 31, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.680" offset="387448">The National Cash Register appealed this assessment to the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, which is an administrative body and it did affirm the Tax Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.314" offset="426005">Upon appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court by the NCR, the court in which we considered an unprecedented decision of 5:2 overturn 100 years, this Court has carefully developed the definition of export and held that the property in question was in fact an export.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.720" offset="511582">It is our contention that tangible personal property located in a state on tax listing date is subject to the State’s right to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.462" offset="550557">And that’s especially clear where in a situation like this the property has received something from the state for which the state can ask something in return and where no movement of any sort has occurred toward a stream of exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.093" offset="617117">The facts in this case basically are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.405" offset="630387">The National Cash Register Company has its world headquarters, main production facilities and warehouse in Dayton, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.449" offset="662570">It primarily manufactures cash registers, accounting machines and data processing machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.690" offset="691513">It markets these throughout the United States and in 124 foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.237" offset="717740">When a foreign order is placed with NCR, it is sent to the factory in Dayton where the product is manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.448" offset="742504">NCR maintains no inventory of machines, capable of meeting incoming orders from foreign customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.896" offset="780330">This is because many countries will not allow a partial shipment and because in some cases, the import licenses cannot be gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.889" offset="820349">After the machine is produced and inspected, it is packaged for export shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.202" offset="841561">The property involved in this case was specifically constructed for foreign customers, finished, crated and in storage and inventory in NCR’s warehouse awaiting foreign shipment on December 31, 1967 when Ohio personal property taxation was assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.368" offset="914181">So on tax listing date, which was December 31st, 1967, payment had not been made to NCR by the perspective purchasers, no export license had been issued, no letter of credit authorized, the machines were in complete control of NCR, and of most importance, no movement toward the foreign destination had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.589" offset="1003102">And according to NCR’s on witness, this means the items were in inventory and that is prior to when the items had been put on board, the commercial carrier had actually left the shipping dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.521" offset="1058795">Some machines have remained in storage in the warehouse awaiting shipment for up to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.233" offset="1081678">The record does show that no machines manufactured by NCR were ever diverted or are capable of being diverted to the domestic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.952" offset="1120549">Due to special construction, the machines could not economically be converted from domestic use and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.341" offset="1146149">The record shows that against NCR’s profit margin of about 5%, the conversion cost would be approximately 16% of the cost of the machine.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Dwight C. Pettay, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="279.542" offset="1194945">I would imagine they would show the -- the record does not show that but I’m sure they would.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.861" offset="1232144">It is our position that in interpreting the Import-Export Clause of the U.S. Constitution, this Court has had at least seven occasions in which to consider the question and this started in 1886 and the last one was in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.417" offset="1298390">And in each of these cases, the Court has taken a consistent position and that being is that there is not export until movement -- final movement does occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.914" offset="1348441">I would like very briefly to discuss three of these cases if I may, which we think represents this Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.562" offset="1378952">The first case of importance is Coe versus Errol and this was an 1886 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.688" offset="1399536">In that case, this Court dealt with a factual situation of spruce logs, which were cut in New Hampshire and placed in a stream to be floated down the river to Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.223" offset="1441646">They were detained in Errol, New Hampshire by little water and they were taxed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.198" offset="1461499">This Court struggled with the issue of whether the products of the state are liable to be taxed like other property in the state though intended for exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.968" offset="1500578">And the answer was yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.618" offset="1507265">This Court held that until there is actual or final movement that the goods apart from the general mass and property of the state and are subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.233" offset="1549688">The Court also stated that the owner’s state of mind, in other words, his intent did not cause the exemption from taxation to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.488" offset="1590648">The next important case we believe is A. G. Spalding, which this Court considered in 1923 and the reason that case was important was because Mr. Justice Holmes noted that a point must be fixed at which the export must be said to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.187" offset="1653447">He said, “It was important to note that because in some cases, there is a point very near on one side or the other and unless the point is fixed, any determination may seem arbitrary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="410.225" offset="1717603">The most recent decision of this Court and one in which the facts are most similar to this case is the Empresa case in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.084" offset="1753130">In that case, a cement plant in California was sold to a South American Corporation for export.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.312" offset="1777998">An export license was issued, title passed, and a common carrier was hired to dismantle and package the plant for shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.060" offset="1809032">The county levied a personal property tax on the parts of the plant, and it had not been shipped out of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.866" offset="1840170">Mr. Justice Douglas held that it was taxable stating that it is not enough -- intent to export is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.887" offset="1868278">It is in fact the entrance of the articles into the export’s steam that marks the start of the process of exportation and he stated that nothing less would suffice.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.415" offset="3250364">I think that we agree that there was a point in time where the immunity provided by the constitution will preclude a state or locality from the levying of tax upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.556" offset="3298952">The question is simply when that that time and if that time has arrived in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.401" offset="3326328">I will not dwell on the facts of this case because they're entirely not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.700" offset="3343569">There is no controversy or whatever I think between the state and the company over the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.749" offset="3363736">But I would like to spend a few moments in addressing myself to the question, why should physical motion be required to be shown before the immunity provided by the export clause attaches?</text>
            <text syncTime="836.562" offset="3422981">It’s our position that in this case, there is no need whatsoever for showing physical motion before immunity does attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.830" offset="3464046">Why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="847.992" offset="3468748">Simply because the physical character of the goods in question demonstrates conclusively that the goods can’t go any place else but overseas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.605" offset="7039164">I suppose that the State of Ohio was saying that this Court should in some way weigh the export immunity as it has in the Commerce Clause area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.554" offset="7790968">So in determining when the certainty of exportation of those goods was to be fixed, it was a very reasonable conclusion to say only upon delivery to a carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.343" offset="8058149">Mr. Chief Justice, we believe the issue in this case is the state’s right to tax tangible personal property located within that state and if that’s the primary issue, not whether there is -- whether the test is not certainty of export.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.974" offset="8128679">It’s the state’s right to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.750" offset="8139755">In that sense, I would like to quote from Joy Oil where this Court said that, “The Export-Import Clause was meant to confer immunity from local taxation upon property being exported, not to relieve property eventually to be exported from its share of the cost of local services."</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.843" offset="8208091">And there's nothing in the record to show that these specific machines have been taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.581" offset="8231079">They have not so that although National Cash Register is paying real property taxes and maybe paying other types of tangible personal property taxes on other things, it has not paid any taxes on the specific machines and issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.891" offset="8300356">Although some of them conceivably could’ve been in Ohio for several or at least for a period of time and derived services during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.706" offset="8339540">Secondly, there is no evidence in the record to show what effect if any Ohio tangible personal property taxation had upon these goods in question, whether they had any effect or whatsoever on their salability or NCR’s ability to compete in the foreign market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.007" offset="8408816">The amount of tax here in question today is slightly less than $50,000.00 although the actual assessment was $1 million when you reduce that by the applicable percentage, we are only talking about $50,000.00.</text>
