            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ll hear arguments next in 73-781, Scherk against Alberto-Culver Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.185" offset="217443">Mr. Hanley, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_f_hanley" startTime="38.019" stopTime="381.646">
            <label>Mr. Robert F. Hanley</label>
            <text syncTime="38.019" offset="228833">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.464" offset="242625">I represent the petitioner Fritz Scherk and this case involves the acquisition of petitioner’s three related European cosmetic businesses by respondent Alberto-Culver, an American Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.684" offset="311484">The issue that’s presented is the enforceability of arbitration clauses entered into as part of international agreements in the face of charges of violations of the Securities Exchange Act Section 10 (b) and Rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.781" offset="395912">The facts as reflected in the complaint and in the un-contradicted portions of the affidavits which were filed in the trial court and the district court are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.146" offset="457352">Alberto-Culver became interested in petitioner’s businesses back in June or July of 1967 and apparently became interested because they were having some problems getting their products, their hair products and so forth into the German market, accepted on the German market and Scherk apparently had a good name, established name in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.865" offset="576157">So in June or July steps were taken, contacts were made in Berlin, in West Berlin by Alberto-Culver.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.129" offset="613251">Your Honors, there’s some disagreement between the parties as to whether a meeting which was held in Melrose Park, Illinois in May of 1968 or meeting in West Berlin in March of 1968 was the most significant with respect to putting this transaction together.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.679" offset="695484">But there is no contradiction about the fact that these negotiations commenced in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.869" offset="732264">They were then negotiated and conducted in both Europe and the United States for a period of two years and they -- and finally came to conclusion at a closing in Geneva, Switzerland in June of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.371" offset="798198">Now, a battery of attorneys took months to put together these acquisition agreements which are spread over some 100 and 125 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.507" offset="838740">And they contained clear clauses by which the parties agreed to negotiate, to arbitrate all future disputes before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, France.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.814" offset="904046">The parties used both American and German attorneys in investigating and in negotiating and putting together this sale of these three foreign businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.382" offset="950230">They also used trademark experts, business consultants, and Alberto-Culver used its outside auditors Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.763" offset="983771">Part of the purchase price for the companies was paid in the form of promissory, four promissory notes which were delivered to the petitioner Mr. Scherk at the time of the closing in Geneva.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.362" offset="1042181">Now, in 1970 Alberto-Culver concluded that Petitioner Mr. Scherk had breached trademark warranties, having to do with trademarks that had been owned by the Scherk Enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.192" offset="1109473">And he charged -- they charged a violation -- they brought suit notwithstanding the arbitration clause, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois charging in June of 1971, charging violations of Section 10 (b), Rule 10b-5 charged common law, deceit, fraud, and charged a breach of warranty -- breach of trademark warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.755" offset="1223784">And Mr. Scherk had taken steps to arbitrate the controversy in Paris back in January of 1971. But he had not filed the necessary papers take on to formal steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.913" offset="1268402">Those steps were not taken until after the suit in this case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.499" offset="1286792">Those steps were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.338" offset="1290136">Arbitration was commenced officially or formally in November of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.724" offset="1315631">We filed motions to dismiss the complaint based upon contentions that the court was without jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.729" offset="1355651">The court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter and on the basis of forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.937" offset="1376444">In the alternative, we also applied for a stay pending arbitration, stay of the proceedings in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.469" offset="1406642">Our motions were all denied and the District Court granted an injunction enjoining the Petitioner Mr. Scherk from proceeding with arbitration in Paris.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.426" offset="1454498">The Seventh Circuit affirmed, analyzing and applying the court’s 1953 decision in Wilko versus Swan as invalidating arbitration clauses and of course on the Wilko against Swan, the invalidation was with respect to charges -- was in the face of charges under the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.812" offset="1551987">Here, we are talking about the -- and here is the Seventh Circuit applied Wilko v. Swan in the phase of charges of violations, the Exchange Act in 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.020" offset="1600784">Our position --</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert F. Hanley</label>
            <text syncTime="382.318" offset="1606008">Yes, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="382.978" offset="1608620">-- to what extent are you pursuing the suggestion of the Federal District Court in Illinois did not have jurisdiction of this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_f_hanley" startTime="392.283" stopTime="678.348">
            <label>Mr. Robert F. Hanley</label>
            <text syncTime="392.283" offset="1645923">Your Honor, we believe that the Federal District Court has now ruled and in the face of our motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds we believe and the Court of Appeals has -- if you are asking me as far as the preliminary injunction is concerned, the Court of Appeals has ruled that it had jurisdiction under 1292 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="418.088" offset="1749055">We certainly agree with that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.895" offset="1756369">This was the granting of an injunction, a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.486" offset="1774655">We have, as far as our motion to dismiss was not certified here and that issue I believe is just not the issue of whether or not this is a security of whether or not Mr. Scherk was properly before the Court, I don’t think is any longer subject to debate in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.544" offset="1882906">We have proceeded on the assumption that the court has jurisdiction over the parties -- over the subject matter and that this appeal was properly before this Court as a preliminary injunction under 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.388" offset="1946331">Our position here is that this Court upon a re-analysis of Wilko versus Swan in the light of the international context here and a strong federal policy favoring arbitration need not and should not apply Wilko versus Swan mechanically -- mechanistically and invalidate arbitration agreements where security violations are alleged in this international context.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.660" offset="2071406">There is no compelling reason to extend Wilko versus Swan.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.449" offset="2086557">And some very great good reasons we assert of why Wilko should not be applied in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.009" offset="2120829">Circuit Judge Stevens said in his dissenting opinion below, “The enforcement of these arbitration agreements in this case would not frustrate the policies of the Exchange Act whereas refusal to enforce them would certainly frustrate important policies which this Court is articulated as recently as 1972 in the Zapata case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="534.116" offset="2213198">It’s clear, I believe, it’s absolutely clear that without Wilko versus Swan, the arbitration provisions in these – in this acquisition – on these acquisition agreements would be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.071" offset="2265025">They be enforced under either Chapter one or Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act and we look in vain and have read the briefs in vain for any reason to support the mechanical application of Wilko versus Swan to the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.370" offset="2330227">The respondent is not going to lose his right to be heard on these trademark -- these breaches of trademark, the arbitration, the arbitral courts have and can arbitrate matters going to allegations of fraud and breaches of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.765" offset="2419775">The respondent says in effect, “I agree to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.048" offset="2436911">Now, I do not want to arbitrate anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.384" offset="2442240">And I look around and I found this Supreme Court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.080" offset="2453107">1953 cases says I don’t have to and it gives me an excuse so I am not going to live up to my bargain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="600.359" offset="2478184">And the respondent points to the language of Section 27 of the Exchange Act which says that District Courts shall have explosive jurisdiction of violations to the title or the rules and regulations there under and that all suits an equity in actions in law to enforce any liability or duly created under the title and so forth will be in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.411" offset="2562403">Now, he points to that – the respondent points the language and says that, “As I understand his argument that all securities disputes must be resolved in the United States District Courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="633.205" offset="2609528">That does not comport with reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.260" offset="2621753">The Securities Exchange Commission is resolving securities disputes everyday in arbitration proceedings where the matters are involved, existing disputes are being arbitrated everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.527" offset="2678805">We are having resolution of securities problems and arbitration proceedings between members of exchanges where they have rules requiring arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.519" offset="2718824">We are having arbitration in securities matters and proceedings between non-members and members of exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.454" offset="2746514">And we’re having arbitration proceedings where the broker opposes arbitration and the customer fixes it, and it just doesn’t follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.348" offset="2790191">It’s your admission I guess that that language means that if an action under the Exchange Act 34 comes to a Court it’s the Federal District Courts that have exclusive jurisdiction, exclusive of the state courts, is that your point?</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.523" offset="6530821">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.800" offset="6547958">The American Arbitration Association as amicus in this matter is terribly concerned not with the merits of this particular case, but the impact of international business contract drafting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.626" offset="6599262">We have at issue here, not the public policy attached to the issuance of an arbitration award because that has not yet occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.615" offset="6635207">We have a standard type of business transaction where two parties from different countries who cannot agree to the choice of law of a different foreign country or foreign court, who typically provide for a dispute settlement mechanism, usually arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.638" offset="6707304">In this instance, the tribunal is a worldwide well-known tribunal, the International Chamber of Commerce sitting at Paris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.423" offset="6738442">The arbitration clause provides for a neutral country between this American and this German.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.605" offset="6763207">Both of these countries have ratified a treaty, United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Awards, but that convention contains within it a specific provision of the enforcement of arbitration agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.742" offset="6827677">The convention also states the specific grounds upon which a court may refuse to honor that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.810" offset="6859964">I would call to your attention that public policy is not one of those listed grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.943" offset="6884519">I think it is very important to know that four major developments occurred in this country within the past few years, dealing with this convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.183" offset="6921509">The first is the fact that Congress amended Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.086" offset="6949094">This Court was only ruling upon Chapter 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act in 1953 in the Wilko case. Congress not only added a new chapter to that Act, but the Senate advised and consented on this International Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.283" offset="7009907">Only two years ago, the Government of the United States in a series of joint agreements with the Russians, the Polish and more agreements are forthcoming have provided for this mechanism, the use of voluntary arbitration in a neutral country to resolve all commercial, business disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.245" offset="7089737">Finally, only this year the American Bar Association and its House of Delegates wrote a letter to all of the other countries of the world through their BAR associations, advising and recommending that they pass this convention which has now been passed in 42 countries of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.507" offset="7166746">There is no other practical way to settle international business disputes and though the arbitration mechanism.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.545" offset="8722913">In fact, in Domestic law this Court has already ruled, that if you have a problem of fraud and the inducement or misrepresentation in Prima Paint then that is a matter for the arbitrator between Prima Paint and Zapata and moving very slightly to another rule in this case which would encourage the use of international commercial arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.663" offset="8823432">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.011" offset="8836807">Before turning to what I consider to be some inaccuracies in the statement of facts made by my brethren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.201" offset="8865541">I would like to make this observation after having heard the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.085" offset="8881110">The two concessions which have been made here by counsel which I thought were impliedly conceded in the briefs as well, namely that (1) personal jurisdiction exists and (2) subject matter jurisdiction exists that is the coverage of the Act, leaves the petitioner in logic to ask this Court to overrule Wilko versus Swan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.915" offset="8980376">That, I think is the necessary impact of their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.542" offset="8994900">Now, why were these concessions made?</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.052" offset="9012976">Two reasons, one factual the other legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.437" offset="9026456">First of all, the petitioner has consistently overlooked the fact that securities fraud was committed in this country within the territorial boundaries of United States to the injury of an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.332" offset="9082044">Recent decisions including the Leasco case in the Second Circuit and the Travis Case in the Eighth Circuit have applied the Act to this type of situation, whether negotiated or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.966" offset="9132617">So, if the Act applies, Section 29 (a) must apply as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.638" offset="9155291">Now, a suggestion has been made, the 29 (a) should not be the same as 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.278" offset="9185907">Since the language of the two statutes is the same we fail to see how that can occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.489" offset="9266678">It is that my client, an American company is not a person within the meaning of 29 (a) which bars any stipulation by any person to waive compliance with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.434" offset="9314534">That we submit is a matter of statutory logic, construction and policy and should not be followed by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.270" offset="9353822">In fact it expressly accommodates Wilko and 29 (a) in international transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.209" offset="9381616">Consider the effect, if the Court will, if you were to recognize an exception to this Act wherever the defendant is a foreigner, even though he has come into this country to fraud an American citizen he is concededly subject to the jurisdiction of the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.646" offset="9511288">The agreement is a stipulation Chief Justice Burger and Section 27 of the Act creating exclusive jurisdiction is a provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.624" offset="9543262">Now, if you can see as the petitioner has done here, that the Act applies, it must necessarily follow we submit that Section 29 (a) applies and Section 27 also applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.764" offset="9651827">I would like to address myself to that because I think this is the heart of Chief Judge Friendly's position in Leasco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.083" offset="9685055">There you had securities which were totally foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.662" offset="9699370">You had a negotiated transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.561" offset="9710968">You had foreign defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.692" offset="9723507">And nevertheless, the Court there held on traditional principles of international law, Foreign Relations Law of the United States that what was key was not whether if the securities were those of a foreign corporation, but whether or not that company through its representatives in the concededly negotiated transaction came to this country and here on our soil defrauded an American citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.514" offset="9894766">There is only one question presented in petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.666" offset="9907409">Leasco didn't involve arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.529" offset="9914828">It simply involved the applicability of the 34 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.698" offset="9927576">And that brings as I suppose to an analysis or proper analysis of both 29 (a) and Wilko because we concededly have power over this man, albeit he is a foreigner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.396" offset="9966341">Our courts have jurisdiction over him just as they had jurisdiction over the defendant in Wilko.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.482" offset="9986717">Now, we submit that the petitioner here has mis-characterized this Court’s holding in Wilko or misunderstood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.235" offset="10021721">It is true that that case involved a suit by a customer against the brokerage house, but what the Court had before it Section 14 of the 33 Act was again like 29 (a) of the 34 Act, a statute of general applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.908" offset="10080340">It purported to benefit or protect any person signing any stipulation agreement or a provision waiving compliance with any portion of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.363" offset="10118165">The majority opinion stated on its face, the opinion of Justice Reid, “that we recognize under the certain circumstances, buyers and sellers of securities may bargain at arm’s length, but we nevertheless hold that the intention of Congress is better carried out by finding void any agreement to arbitrate a future dispute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.464" offset="10210638">It was a statement of general applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.534" offset="10222864">In his dissenting opinion, Justice Frankfurter recognized this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.962" offset="10240627">He said, “We do not have before us here a case of overreaching, a case of coercion” and he nevertheless concluded in the last sentence, “I read the majority’s opinion to be a general limitation, a general limitation on the Federal Arbitration Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.645" offset="10303321">Now that was the law as it stood in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.033" offset="10320875">Petitioner would have the Court believe that it is we who are trying to expand the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.114" offset="10337176">Nothing could be farther from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.219" offset="10345639">The question is whether the convention repealed Section 29 (a) and Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.665" offset="10371448">And for the reasons which have been outlined already here in argument, we feel that an argument of repealer here was totally without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.789" offset="10399869">The State Department, when they prepared a memorandum for the President, pointed out that these provisions of public policy, incapable of being enforced are intended to take account of the laws which prohibit the submission of certain questions to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.189" offset="10465489">Wilko is such a holding Section 14 is such a law, Section 29 (a) is such a law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.137" offset="11589277">The transaction indeed may be international, but that fraud is domestic and it is that fraud, the domestic fraud which confers both personal subject matter jurisdiction and gives the plaintiff, the injured plaintiff the right to access in the United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.063" offset="11649045">Under the 33 Act it would be either state or federal as he chose and under the 34 Act it would be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the district courts, but you asked about the Illinois law provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.028" offset="11692826">This is again a factor which is probably not necessary to our position under this case, but certainly it reinforces it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.238" offset="11721665">As the amicus, the AAA points out in his brief when the party is selected Illinois law, they ipso facto by operation of law selected federal law to the extent that it’s applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.824" offset="12044016">Zapata has been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.668" offset="12055406">The Zapata is indeed an important case, but the Chief Justice’s opinion in Zapata clearly indicates room and in fact explicitly makes room for this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.619" offset="12103262">The opinion states that choice of forum provision should be declared void if it’s contravened statutory or judicially declared public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.003" offset="12140774">And in support of that proposition, the Chief Justice's opinion cited Boyd versus Grand Trunk Western Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.340" offset="12170136">Boyd was the first of the string of cases which this Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.754" offset="12187794">There, a railroad employee restricted his right of venue under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.324" offset="12206080">In fact it was after the dispute arose in Boyd, nevertheless, this Court held that agreement was void to the extent that it attempted to deprive this man of his right to sue wherever the statute provided the railroad could be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.178" offset="12265430">Boyd was relied on in Wilko.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.691" offset="12275461">Now the Court said in Wilko, “We notice in Boyd that we declared void a post dispute agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.956" offset="12300539">We do not have to go that far today and we are not doing so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.890" offset="12316317">And it was that I think that led to Justice Jackson’s concurring opinion, leaving open this question of a post dispute agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.189" offset="12349544">We do not have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.057" offset="12360934">If it comes before the Court, an agreement entered into after the dispute arises, different policy considerations are going to be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.732" offset="12391654">You have a question of whether or not this is akin or analogous to a settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.017" offset="12412865">In any event this Court has not faced or decided that issue and it does not involve in the case before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.088" offset="12441078">An argument could certainly be made as a matter of statutory construction that such an agreement should be void just as this Court held the Boyd agreement was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.455" offset="12486531">So summing up, neither of the two exceptions which have been urged here by the petitioner, namely the exception based upon some concept of disparity of bargaining power or sophisticated people, or the fact that he is a foreigner who chose to come to this country and subject himself to the Act, can hold substance either under the language of Section 29 (a) or under 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.488" offset="12586736">A suggestion has been made that there is nothing unusual about a 10b-5 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.300" offset="12609933">That this is something very simple to understand, but if this Court were to hold that an arbitration agreement requires a adjudication of this matter before a foreign tribunal or it’s a virtual certainty that there will be unfamiliarity with this Act, then as this Court noted in Bernhardt, the remission of this case, the change of this case from a court to arbitration would have a very definite potential for affecting the underlying substantive right to recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.762" offset="12727798">Arbitration is not simply in a formal matter, a procedural matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.390" offset="12746292">This Court held it in Bernhardt under the -- under an eerie question really, that arbitration versus the court is a matter of substance, and can affect and perhaps even destroy the plaintiff’s right to recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.014" offset="12796761">Under circumstances where the power of review, the development of the record, the lack of discovery, the lack of development of unknown body of doctrine for the guidance of the public and all the other infirmities of arbitration mentioned in Wilko are equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.353" offset="12862171">So, under the circumstances we ask this Court to follow its holding in Wilko not to overrule that case because neither the statute nor the convention or any other judicial authority requires or permits it, and to affirm the judgments of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and of the District Court.</text>
