            <text syncTime="8.369" offset="110237">This case involves questions under a village ordinance enacted in New York villages, Village of Belle Terre on Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.461" offset="178573">It is a small village of about 700 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.907" offset="196336">It has an ordinance that restricts an area to family resident roots.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.479" offset="254642">It includes in the definition of the word ‘family’, one or more persons related by blood, adoption or marriage, and also two unrelated persons living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.410" offset="358400">The owner of the house in question, leased it to six college students who were not related, and the proceeding is brought ahead for violation, starting the violation of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.386" offset="446276">Hence, this action was then brought to declare the ordinance unconstitutional if violative of the Equal Protection Clause and other constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.410" offset="506358">The District court held the ordinance unconstitutional and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.531" offset="542824">We have reversed the Court of Appeals holding that this zoning ordinance is lower than the limits of the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.077" offset="605100">It’s not countered upon the racial basis and not involving a discrimination in a constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.329" offset="646060">The views are expressed in an opinion filed with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.532" offset="666854">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a separated dissenting opinion.</text>
