            <text syncTime="18.530" offset="150883">It is a class action brought by Non-English speaking Chinese student in public schools of San Fransisco, the defendants being the officials who are responsible for the operation of the school system, and they seek relief against what they call the unequal educational opportunities which are alleged to violate the requirements of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.519" offset="282854">There is no specific remedy urged upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.886" offset="312320">Teaching English to the students of Chinese ancestry who do not speak the language is one possible choice, giving instruction to this group in Chinese is another.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.699" offset="479504">Our decision rests entirely upon the Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which excludes from participation in Federal financial assistance recipients of aid could discriminate against racial groups and as we analyze the regulations done with this act, such a showing has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.757" offset="591726">Accordingly we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
