            <label>Mr. Joseph C. Barton</label>
            <text syncTime="6.279" offset="101878">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.467" offset="114625">I believe at the conclusion of yesterday's session, the Court had addressed itself to the 6 (c) argument concerning the application of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.122" offset="157257">In that connection, I would like to point out to the Court that the Securities and Exchange Commission in their amicus brief files in the osmosis of the Solicitor General considered that very argument made by the petitioner, and stated on Page 9 of its brief that there is no basis for suggesting that Rule 347 (b) was required to implement the literal language of the act or any commission rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.379" offset="278256">It further concluded that the application of California law was proper in this case and urged affirmance of the California court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.854" offset="320157">I would like to point out regarding Section 6 (c) that it specifically provides that any rule enacted by any exchange must conform to the the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act as well as the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that this Court has held in Silver v. New York Stock Exchange that the rule of an exchange may be judicially invalidated as being beyond the great purposes of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.364" offset="478250">I submit that rule, that 28 (c) and Rule 347 (b) as adopted by the New York Stock Exchange is a stipulation, that's in the meaning of Section 78 CCA of the Act and is void by reason there of.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.274" offset="569887">Moreover, it is inconsistent with the grant of judicial authority that Congress gave the courts in Section 27 of the Act which would be 15 U.S.C. 78aa and that provides that the District Courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter with the rules and regulations they are under.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.285" offset="665913">In addition, Rule 347 (b) is inconsistent with the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, since admittedly, it is an agreement which concerns interstate commerce and which is a part of the employment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.730" offset="731638">As this Court noted in the Prima Paint decision, the Federal Arbitration Act was not meant to apply to contracts of employment between parties of an equal bargaining strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.950" offset="784509">Justice Black in his dissenting opinion in that case spelled out the legislative intent behind the Federal Arbitration Act, and that was that it was not meant to apply to contracts of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.749" offset="843755">Now both this Court and Silver and the Senate Subcommittee, the Securities -- the Subcommittee on Securities in its extensive analysis of the functioning of the New York Stock Exchange concluded that judicial review was necessary regarding the self regulatory powers of the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.144" offset="929332">I would like to observe at this point that it is not the New York Stock Exchange which is a party to this lawsuit but rather a private corporation that came into existence by virtue of state law and that Merrill Lynch, like being a member of the0 New York Stock Exchange is also a member of the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange which is physically located in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.004" offset="1052735">Now if Congress meant physical location in Section 6 c, it would lead to disunity in decision because there are many stock exchanges located throughout the country which are not in New York and that would give a stock exchange moreover, the opportunity to physically locate itself in a state whose laws are favorable to its policies and thereby effectively emasculate the laws of 49 other states.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="278.085" offset="1189094">You are suggesting then that if Pacific Coast Exchange had a rule like the New York Stock Exchange does, it could not enforce it under Merrill Lynch's theory because it is physically located in California?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph C. Barton</label>
            <text syncTime="290.795" offset="1239980">Yes, I submit that would be correct under one rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.889" offset="1256281">I believe that Congress intended, by location to mean the application of those laws of a state which have significant interest in the case, such as California in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.619" offset="1315213">The Pacific Stock Exchange had any rules touching this area of relationship between a termination of employment of a registered customers plan or employer?</text>

            <text syncTime="323.242" offset="1369757">Your Honor, the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange does have rules concerning arbitration which are very similar to Article 8, Section 1 of the New York Stock Exchange Constitution which provides in essence that a member, Merrill Lynch in this case cannot compel beyond member to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.221" offset="1453662">That choice is given to the non-member, if he willingly wishes to invoke arbitration and the rationale behind that distinction is that obviously Merrill Lynch has voice in the exchange rules which an employee does not have, so they do not have equal bargaining strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.457" offset="1522625">So they give the non-number the option to request arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.041" offset="2756963">However, in all fairness, I should note that if the court consider arbitration to be an outcome determinative, as was indicated in the Bernhard decision, then that part of the California decision would be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.271" offset="2821851">I should also like to know Your Honor that if I understood counsel's opening argument, he indicated that the profit-sharing plan by virtue of Article 18.1, which is noted at page 41 Appendix, specifically stated the profit-sharing plan was not to be construed as part of the employment contract, and I submit under that theory then Rule 347(b) would have no application in this case, because it specifically relates to employment disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.596" offset="2963122">And by the functioning of Article 18.1, it would be excluded from the application of Rule 347(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="743.674" offset="3051416">Now each and every respondent is a citizen or resident of the state of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.359" offset="3078165">All they have done is petitioned their own state courts or decision regarding this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.244" offset="3101675">They have not sought to go outside their home state, for example Nevada or Wyoming to forum shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.110" offset="3133231">This is not a case of forum shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.748" offset="3151726">Now the policy of California is spelled out in several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.727" offset="3175654">California courts deemed in a matter of important strong public policy considering the right of the wager into to all lawfully approved wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.379" offset="3214315">In this context, I would like to note that although technically Merrill Lynch made all contributions to the profit-sharing plans, those contributions evolved because of the work and labor of the employees, who contributed to the profit of Merrill Lynch, and it is no different than Merrill Lynch writing out a check to Mr, Ware or any other respondent for their weekly wages because profit-sharing even as interpreted by Federal Court, results because of a man's labor and is not construed as a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.835" offset="3372095">Now, the concern of the Courts to avoid forfeitures has manifested I think most recently by the action of the senate in adopting and passing HR4200, which is the private pension plan will, and that states no unequivocal terms that to qualify under the Internal Revenue Code, a pension may not contain a forfeiture provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.929" offset="3488496">It also provides that an individual works and is given retirement benefits can carry those benefits from employer to employee, excuse me to employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.592" offset="3539069">Now this is more or less a parallel to profit-sharing, it shows the great concern not only in the state courts but in Congress that may not be deprived of his lawfully approved benefits and that he be paid them.</text>
