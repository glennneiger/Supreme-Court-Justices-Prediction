            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ll resume arguments in number 72-1637.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.395" offset="118282">Mr. McPherson, I think you have about 22 minutes remaining.</text>

          <turn speaker="george_k_mcpherson_jr" startTime="15.798" stopTime="323.805">
            <label>Mr. George K. McPherson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="15.798" offset="139912">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.055" offset="152973">Yesterday, general counsel attempted to categorize or characterize the right to strike as being different from other Section 7 rights guaranteed under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.399" offset="202292">I frankly don’t think that Section 7 either graduates or categorizes any of the rights under Section 7 into separate categories or characterizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.806" offset="251925">I do know, however, that the right to strike is dealt with specifically by the National Labor Relations Act whereas the right to distribute literature is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.264" offset="293825">There is no provision in the Act that per se gives and fully leaves the right to distribute literature on company property.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.980" offset="320679">It is a right that has arisen inferentially as a means of communication to effectuate Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.000" offset="336771">As a means of communication, it is therefore, not so unique or not so fundamental that it cannot under certain circumstances be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.390" offset="406256">And as I mentioned yesterday on the point of fair representation, the Court’s holding in the Mastro case was based upon the premise of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.959" offset="456620">That fair representation theory, I think, should extend to the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.794" offset="479922">And in this case, particularly when you are looking at the fundamental purpose of the Act, being to foster collective bargaining or the principle of freedom of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.271" offset="525793">Where you have freedom of contract and collective bargaining being engaged in, that process should go without being interfered in, except where absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.551" offset="582949">I think the Court stated the concern that it would have with undue interference into the collective bargaining process when they talked about conflicting rights in Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.067" offset="632999">There, the Court was faced with distribution rights of non-employees as opposed to property rights of employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.088" offset="665078">In that particular case, this Court held that where there was no necessary conflict, there should not be an abridgment of either right.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.381" offset="702276">I think that is particularly true in the type of case we have here where we have freedom of contract on one hand versus a means of communication on the other which would lead me into this Court’s decision in Nutone, the steelworkers’ case.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.279" offset="765910">There, the Court was faced with whether or not employers could utilize a means of communication which they prohibited employees from using.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.767" offset="807811">And in that case, stated that unions and employees are not guaranteed every means of communication simply because the employer may utilize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.120" offset="849189">But that whether or not an unfair labor practice is committed, whether or not no distribution or no solicitation rules should be invalidated is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.333" offset="902060">The Court noted in Nutone that there was no showing just as in this instant case of any undue influence or interference with the employees’ ability to communicate with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.077" offset="957022">It also stated to the Board that alternate means of communication was highly relevant to a consideration as to whether distribution or solicitation rule should be invalidated, and stated that since that issue was not presented to the Board and no evidence taken on it, the employer’s conduct could not be found wanting.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.129" offset="1049287">That basically is what I think the respondent’s position is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.073" offset="1069035">We do not argue as the Supreme Court pointed out in the Nutone case that under every factual situation or under every circumstance it may arise there may not be an unfair labor practice committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.150" offset="1133296">What we do say is that the Board should not presume away the freedom of contract of the parties, but should rather look to see if there has in fact been an interference with the communication rights that employees may have under Section 7, and that was not done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.418" offset="1218456">No analysis was made whatsoever of the alternatives available to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.694" offset="1243533">Had there been, they would have seen that the evidence on the record clearly established the fact that for 16 years, the union and employees had effectively distributed literature at company gates, that the employees had the right of free discussion and free solicitation on company property which brings with it the right to sign union cards or to sign petitions, to decertify or to start to the decertification proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.471" offset="4414589">One other point, I think is of concern in this case is the Board in overruling its decision in Gale Products has gone farther in formulating its remedy than it has ever gone before in this area and much farther than it went in the Fifth Circuit or the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.421" offset="4506436">In those circuits which the Board relies on as supporting their proposition, the remedy there was limited to distribution or solicitation on behalf of any other labor organization other than the incumbent or distribution or solicitation against any labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.402" offset="4590341">Now, here, they have also gone that step, but they have added the additional step of throwing in all other Section 7 rights, regardless of whether you have the potential split between employee interest and the incumbent union’s interest as seems to be feared by the Fifth Circuit in Mid-States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.655" offset="4679367">In other words, under the Board’s remedy as they have fashioned it in this case, it would apply to a handout announcing a union meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.616" offset="4711236">It would apply to a reminder to pay union dues.</text>
