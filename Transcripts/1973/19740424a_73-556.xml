            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="24.028" offset="172826">Mr. Justice Douglas and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.853" offset="196127">These cases are hereon writs of certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit, which in a 5:4 en banc decision, denied enforcement of the Board’s orders directed against respondent unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.467" offset="274599">The basic question is whether a union violates Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the National Labor Relations Board Act which bars a union from restraining an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.326" offset="362057">By disciplining supervisors with such duties who are union members for crossing a picket line during an economic strike against the employer and performing work which would ordinarily have been done by the striking employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.504" offset="442723">There are two cases here which were consolidated in the Court of Appeals, Florida Power and Illinois Bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.872" offset="476264">The facts are essentially similar and I shall outline them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.111" offset="501238">Both Illinois Bell and Florida Power are utility companies which have collective bargaining contracts with locals of the IBEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.941" offset="548467">The bargaining unit covered by the contracts includes rank-and-file employees and some supervisory employees, both of whom are union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.344" offset="602175">In Florida Power union membership was voluntary, in Illinois Bell, the contract contained a Union Security Clause which required unit employees to become and remain members of the Union to the extent of paying dues and fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.957" offset="704575">The Board’s petition sought review of both, the decision in Florida Power and Illinois Bell.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="184.700" offset="815543">There was a grant of the Board’s petition which covered both Illinois Bell and Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.140" offset="841352">There was a grant of the company’s petition in Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.843" offset="876147">So both cases are up here on the Board’s petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.859" offset="896209">Other supervisors of a higher level, for example, District Supervisor, Plant Supervisor, were not covered by the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.936" offset="948454">The companies however permitted the supervisors to retain their Union membership and many of them did.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.900" offset="984398">Some of these were not active union members but held honorary withdrawal cards from their respective locals which entitle them to rejoin the locals at any time without paying an initiation fee, and to apply for pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.465" offset="1050645">In addition, they entitle them to union death benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.856" offset="1088157">Members with withdrawal cards however remain obligated to abide by the Union’s rules and are subjected to discipline if they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.579" offset="1143014">Both companies were struck of a new contract terms and picket lines were set up in front of the plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.532" offset="1190870">The company try to maintain operations with their supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.024" offset="1224829">The record does not show what directions Florida Power gave to its supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.425" offset="1254400">It does show that Illinois Bell informed its supervisors that it would like them to work but that the decision would be left to each supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.366" offset="1298181">The Union, in Illinois Bell, warned the supervisor members that they would be subject to discipline if they perform rank-and-file work during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.952" offset="1340604">Both supervisors, in the contract unit and those outside the unit, cross the picket line and performed work including work that would normally have been performed by the rank-and-file striking employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.880" offset="1416255">After the strike, the Union disciplined those supervisor members who would perform a rank-and-file work.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.873" offset="1444258">In Florida Power, they were fined in amounts of ranging from $100 to $6,000 and many of them were also expelled from membership in their respective locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.000" offset="1492741">And in Illinois Bell, the discipline consisted in most cases of $500 fines which were enforceable by court’s suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.665" offset="1535373">Charges were filed with the Board alleging that the discipline of the supervisor members violated Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.414" offset="1682390">I do not think it is a Party in Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.317" offset="1706005">The Board found that all of the supervisors, whose discipline was at issue, were not only Supervisors within the meaning of Section 2 (11) of the National Labor Relations Act, but were management representatives within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (B), i.e., they had grievance adjustment and/or collective bargaining functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.866" offset="1804225">The Board with one member dissenting held that the Unions violated Section 8 (b) (1) (B) by disciplining those supervisors for performing a rank-and-file work during the strike, and entered an appropriate remedial order.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.178" offset="1873502">The Court of Appeals, as I indicated at the outset, in a 5:4 decision, declined to enforce the Board’s orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.496" offset="1910700">Now, we start with Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act which, as I indicated, mixed at an unfair labor practice for a Union to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.798" offset="1983948">Now there’s no question that this clearly prescribes direct Union pressure of an employer, for example is strike threat, to force it to change the identity of its chosen collective bargaining or grievance adjustment representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.310" offset="2049985">Now in Oakland Mailers, decided in 1968, the Board, for the first time, was confronted with the problem of whether or not Section 8 (b) (1) (B) would also cover the indirect pressure that results from union discipline of a supervisor member who has collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions for the manner in which he performs those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.640" offset="2207347">And the Board concluded that it did on the theory that such discipline would tend to make the supervisor responsive or subservient to the Union’s will and thereby deprive the employer of his full allegiants.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.684" offset="2263458">So that as a practical matter, the employer would either after replace that supervisor or the call to board face the fact to all non-representation by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.145" offset="2309329">Now the court below agrees, although the Union does not, that Section 8 (b) (1) (B) may properly be construed to interdict such indirect pressure on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.045" offset="2364918">As the Court of Appeals pointed out although Section 8 (b) (1) (B) speaks literally in terms of coercing the selection of employer or representatives, it is clear that management’s right to a free selection would be hollow indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.956" offset="2436598">And I’m quoting for the Court “If the Union could dictate the matter in which the selected representative performed his collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="603.125" offset="2489260">Now, the court below, however, that is the majority of the court, concluded that this reasoning does not all true whereas here a supervisor is disciplined for performing rank-and-file work during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.240" offset="2565747">And the Court’s argument is that when a supervisor forsakes his supervisory role to do rank-and-file work, he is no longer acting as a management representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.302" offset="2625933">And that there’s a clear-cut dividing line between supervisory and non-supervisory work, and accordingly, there is no reason to believe that by being forced to take sides with the union, a supervisor will suffer from a change of attitude when after the strike he returns to his normal supervisory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.853" offset="2728124">Now, we submit, as the dissenting judges below correctly observed the position of the majority of the court below reflects on unrealistic view of the role of the strike in the collective bargaining process, because just as a union seeks to strengthen its hand at the bargaining table by bringing the company’s operations to a halt, so management in order to hold out for the terms it wants, seeks to counter this pressure by keeping operations going, and the performance of rank-and-file work during the strike by supervisors and other management representatives is a vital part of such a company effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.621" offset="2931252">So that insofar as the supervisor is called upon by the employer to assist him in keeping the plant running.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.803" offset="2979944">He is acting as a management representative and to discipline him for such activity, we submit, the Board could reasonably conclude, could have a lingering effect that would affect the future performance of his supervisory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.381" offset="3106273">Now, this reading of Section 8 (b) (1) (B), we submit, furthers Congress’s intention with respect to the status of the supervisory employees under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.286" offset="3161861">Only yesterday this Court in the Bell Aerospace decision noted the fact that in 1947, Congress sought to assure employers of the undivided loyalty of their supervisors which it believed had been jeopardized by this Court’s holding in Packard that foremen were employees under the Wagner Act and constituted an appropriate unit for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.926" offset="3284428">Congress believe that the inclusion of Supervisors into organization’s composed of or subservient to the man that they supervised tended to blur the line between management and laborer, and to upset the balance of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.488" offset="3378678">And Congress, the legislative history indicates, was concerned about this result during a strike no less than in other times, because there’s repeated reference in the legislative history to the fact that even when foremen organized in a union of their own, they were nonetheless in a strike situation subservient to the rank-and-file unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.232" offset="3493721">That the foremen’s association had indeed adopted a formal policy, forbidding its members when the rank-and-file union struck -- to enter to struck plants and protect and maintain them without the concurrence of the rank-and-file.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.388" offset="3558296">Now, Congress, in effort to restore this balance, excluded through supervisors from the definition of the employee enhanced from the protection of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.087" offset="3617123">And this relieve the employer of the obligation recognized in Packard to bargain collectively with the union representing its supervisors, and also to insist that the supervisors, under pain of discharge, leave the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.740" offset="3711687">Now, this insistence however, namely that the supervisors leave the union, is not practicable in many industries, such as the construction industry, the printing industry and the utility industry here where rank-and-file employees are highly organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.045" offset="3812937">Supervisors are picked from the rank-and-file and they’re unwilling to give up their union membership, because this could result in the forfeiture of substantial pension and other benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.964" offset="3868630">And moreover, they may return to rank-and-file status in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.815" offset="3887961">On some jobs, they may be supervisor in other jobs or rank-and-file worker.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.452" offset="6422570">Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.140" offset="6441273">I’m Ray Muller for petitioner Florida Power &amp; Light in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.727" offset="6471680">Mr. Come has reviewed the facts and reviewed the law. I’ll try to not recover the ground he has covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.672" offset="6511386">There is, however, an area of this problem that I would like to underline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.817" offset="6540016">Specifically, as a management representative, it’s difficult for me to accept a distinction made by the Court of Appeals and by the union and to some extent by the Board that there is a difference between so called rank-and-file work and management work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.122" offset="6653283">And that that distinction can be a predicate for finding unlawful fines or lawful fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.449" offset="6690586">As a little background, this case came before the Labor Board following a complaint by its Regional Director on a written stipulation of the parties as to issues and facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.598" offset="6751190">The stipulated issue before the Board was whether or not the union’s lawfully fined supervisors with cross picket lines and continued to work for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.840" offset="6808137">No distinction in the original stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.449" offset="6822557">Thereafter the Board in this decision obliquely inserted the rank-and-file versus management work issue by finding that the supervisory fines had been imposed for working, performing work behind the picket line and “including bargaining unit work” and that the fines were illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.631" offset="6931226">So the Board initially inserted that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.985" offset="6948676">Thereafter the Court of Appeals picked up that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.852" offset="6968111">Court of Appeals refined it further and said that if the individual supervisor was engaged in management work, he was immune from union discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.352" offset="7022132">If rank-and-file, he could be disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.483" offset="7034671">The unions apparently agree with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.781" offset="7059853">Our petition to this Court for certiorari also framed, the petitioner Florida Power &amp; Light, also framed the issue and confined it to work for the company behind the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.936" offset="7124532">We made no distinction between management work and so-called rank-and-file work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.383" offset="7158282">The union’s in their brief agree the Congressional policy -- pardon me -- agree the Congressional policy reflects an intent that employers be assured the undivided loyalty of their supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.569" offset="7227037">If that is true, what does undivided loyalty mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.652" offset="7251383">It must mean doing what is in the best interest of management, the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.309" offset="7285969">In a strike situation, as the course apparent that undivided loyalty requires a supervisor to do whatever work is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.096" offset="7333094">He is management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.181" offset="7345424">Realistically, from the strike situation, no distinction is made between rank-and-file work, supervisory work, and management work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.181" offset="7381473">There is work there and it must be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.379" offset="7398296">To include that lawfulness or unlawfulness of a supervisory fine shall be controlled by the type of work the supervisor may be performing behind the picket line would create an entirely unrealistic situation, an unworkable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.094" offset="7481156">Consider, this Florida Power -- well I’m sorry, the current -- the Florida Power &amp; Light strike that we were talking about lasted in excess of 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.634" offset="7519295">Currently, we went through another strike that lasted in excess of 60 days. Consider, the supervisor, if we’re to use the distinction management work versus rank-and-file work, we have the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.375" offset="7594214">During a 60 days strike, did he spend one day doing management work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.816" offset="7616052">Five days doing rank-and-file work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.885" offset="7628278">Was it an hour?</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.494" offset="8718733">Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.027" offset="8732839">Mr. Come has spoken of the practicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.588" offset="8747050">He has said the effects of these cases as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.782" offset="8767843">We submit that what these cases involve is not a practical matter but a statutory matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.905" offset="8792398">We view the controlling question here as one of Congressional intentions specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.511" offset="8814759">Is there anything in either the language of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) or its legislative history that shows that Congress ever contemplated that it would be a violation of that section, for a union to fine its members who are supervisors with the consent of the employer, for engaging in strike bridging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.779" offset="8895843">The language of the section as Mr. Justice Brennan has pointed out is quite clear, it’s unambiguous, it’s narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.105" offset="8925205">The Senate report which we have sited at Page 15 of our brief, the blue brief, also shows that Congress intended no greater reach for that section in its words canoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.258" offset="8981734">It speaks of forcing employers in or out of employer associations and it says also, this section would not permit a union to dictate who shall represent an employer in the settlement of employee grievances or to compel an employer -- to compel the removal of a personnel director or supervisor who has been delegated the function of settling grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.701" offset="9079536">The remarks of Senators Taft and Ellender which we’ve sited in the Page 16 of our brief, again show that that is all the Congress had in mind in Section 8 (b) (1) (B) and in fact, in professing his description of 8 (b) (1) (B), Senator Taft said that the section was not “perhaps of tremendous importance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.998" offset="9156754">There is simply nothing that the Board can point to, to show that Congress was thinking of the discipline of supervisors who are permitted to remain union members when it enacted 8 (b) (1) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.677" offset="9211507">Nor is there anything in the legislative history of that section which deals with this divided loyalty’s question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.792" offset="9235958">It was obviously very much in the mind of the Congress at that time and Congress spoke through Sections 2 (3), 2 (11), and 14 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.779" offset="9271902">But we think the significant point is what they did. Congress did not create an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.199" offset="9301577">Rather there were two what we might call extreme positions advanced at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.240" offset="9321744">One group said, the foreman supervisor should have a chance to remain in their own unions, perhaps not in employee unions but in their own unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.531" offset="9354867">Another group said it should be outlawed completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.190" offset="9365525">And they compromise that was struck said, it’s up to the employer to decide what he wants to let them do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.828" offset="9396036">They were removed form the definition of employee in section 2 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.460" offset="9414635">They were stripped of their rights under the Act and they were allowed to remain union members only of the sufferings of their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.814" offset="9456013">But there is absolutely nothing to which the other side can point which shows that Congress intended to make it an unfair labor practice if the supervisors were to remain in the union, or once they were allowed to remain and were subject to the same union rules as other members, that it would be a violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (B).</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.015" offset="9632810">Now, we are confronted with that argument when we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.262" offset="9645767">Well what about the effect of this so-called evolution of cases since Oakland Mailers in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.474" offset="9670635">Of course, we know as this Court observed yesterday in its Bell Aerospace decision once again that it’s always significant to look at what the Board has done for 20 or 25 years in assessing the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.873" offset="9728209">However, we also recognize that no Court of Appeals has accepted the argument today, that even the Oakland Mailers doctrine steps beyond 8 (b) (1) (B), because it affects more than the selection, the identity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.294" offset="9785887">But as the court below held, even if 8 (b) (1) (B) is read more broadly as the Board has read it in Oakland Mailers, it still has to have some relationship to the performance of an 8 (b) (1) (B) function, which is either collective bargaining or grievance adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.876" offset="9856209">Or at the very least, what the Board has second step stretched it to, to include the performance of some supervisory duty as they are defined in Section 2 (11).</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.022" offset="10000823">We do believe that the Oakland Mailers doctrine actually step beyond the intention of Congress and if that is so and if the Court should so decide, then yes even that would be outside of the reach of 8 (b) (1) (B), but we take a narrower position here as did the court below that even if Oakland Mailers is correct in saying that anytime the employer is engaged in 8 (b) (1) (B) function, collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, or a supervisory duty then the union may not touch him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.601" offset="10131122">We are willing to go that far even though we think that’s beyond the intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.806" offset="10171977">We believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist that Congress intended to read the Board completely out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.452" offset="10198518">Now, let me explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.140" offset="10213355">Congress deprived the supervisor both of his status as an employee and of any rights under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.900" offset="10244389">In the words of Senator Taft, they were “generally restored to the basis which they enjoyed before the passage of the Wagner Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.154" offset="10281378">It was clear from the debates that Congress was concerned that the Board was lending its processes to the organization of supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.118" offset="10321189">And it not only read that the supervisor out of the protection of the Act, but it read the Board out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.067" offset="10345012">It said we are going to leave this to the employer, he can strike an agreement with the union at the bargaining table if he wants to permit them to retain union membership but he doesn’t have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.262" offset="10385763">And in that sense, the only thing that Congress did was to give the employer the leeway to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.604" offset="10419200">And we believe it intended to keep the Board out of the business of regulating supervisory activities or the relationship of the union to its supervisors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence J. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="2820.916" offset="11360444">To use the Board’s word would be interfering with the right of the employer to have this loyalty which we do not believe fits within 8 (b) (1) (B) at all, but if it does, it certainly fits no further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.888" offset="11432333">Basically what the Board and Florida Power argue here, we submit, is a policy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.978" offset="11464620">And we submit in return that what is involved here is not whether the policy which underlies these decisions is a good one or a bad one or what the law should be, but whether it was in fact what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.933" offset="11524493">We submit that both the language of 8 (b) (1) (B), its legislative history, and even the legislative history of 2 (3), 2 (11), and 14 (a) show no support for the Board’s position that Congress made this specific Act an unfair labor practice under 8 (b) (1) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.440" offset="11594501">And we think on that basis alone the court below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.714" offset="11615608">But there is an additional reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.520" offset="11626789">The effect of the Board’s expansive reading of 8 (b) (1) (B) here is to intrude directly into the area of regulation of economic weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.701" offset="11663569">That flies in the phase of Section 13 of the Act, it is contrary to what this Court has told the Board on past occasions, particularly in Insurance Agents and in the Curtis Brothers case, Drivers Local Union, 639, where the Board similarly tried to expand 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.999" offset="11744758">And the Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan, said “You may not do that, we have to stick with what Congress enacted even if the Board thinks it’s a better system.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.163" offset="11785404">It relied on Section 13, it relied on Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s admonition which is certainly pertinent here that the Act was very much the result of conflicting pressures and of compromise, and that expansive readings are not to be given to sections even if their language is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.471" offset="11874638">We submit, 8 (b) (1) (B) does not have ambiguous language to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.438" offset="11894491">Now, the economic weapon, of course, that would be diminished here is the same weapon that was involved in Allis-Chalmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.253" offset="11929809">As this Court said in Allis-Chalmers, at Pages 181, 182, “The economic strike against the employer is the ultimate weapon in labor’s arsenal for achieving agreement upon its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.415" offset="11974426">And the power to fine or expel strike breakers is essential if the union is to be an effective bargaining agent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.648" offset="12003370">And of course those principles were re-affirmed last term in the Boeing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.155" offset="12025417">And as the Court below concluded in all relevant respects, the Allis-Chalmers decision is indistinguishable from the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.480" offset="12070661">The union’s interest is just as valid, it is just as great.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.541" offset="12090932">The employer has the economic weapon of trying to use his supervisors as strike breakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.664" offset="12111412">The union has its right if they are members to discipline them for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.982" offset="12152686">Finally, I would like to say this that the employer in this case says -- first of all, you know we are caught in the middle, and we say to that, you are not at all caught in the middle; you have an absolute right under the Act to say to your supervisors, get out of the union; you may not stay in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.204" offset="12241607">And to say to the union, these supervisors are now beyond your control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.583" offset="12259056">And it’s interesting to note, although it is not in the record and occurred since the record in this case that during the last Florida Power &amp; Light strike, this past winter, the company directed all of its supervisors to resign from the union and in fact, they did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.810" offset="12323944">So the employer has so to speak the ultimate weapon in that respect simply by exercising the option open to it which was the precise remedy which Congress gave it in 14 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.207" offset="12373577">And I think it is also instructed to note what happened in the Illinois Bell case following the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.707" offset="12407536">At Footnote 31 of our brief which is at Page 61, we point out that in 1971, the strike was in 1968, the parties again sat down at the bargaining table, and the employer specifically waived its right to make any effort whatever to force the supervisors out of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.033" offset="12508891">And it did so for a very practical reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.836" offset="12516101">It got a very substantive and substantial concession from the union concerning the jurisdictional claims of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.809" offset="12556016">That, we submit, was the process which Congress intended that the Parties would work out with the employer having the ultimate say “what the status of his supervisors would be.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.882" offset="12608261">In these cases for varying reasons, the employers decided to let their supervisors remain in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.524" offset="12638877">In the Illinois Bell case, I know we can point to something specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.352" offset="12650162">They’ve got benefit in exchange for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.833" offset="12656118">They bargained it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.545" offset="12666880">But it is an impermissible jump to go from there to say that when the employer and nevertheless says they can stay in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.166" offset="12705437">And of course, as members are subject to union control that it suddenly becomes a violation of this narrowly drawn section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.035" offset="12736888">If the union follows its traditional practice which this Court noted in Allis-Chalmers existed along before Taft of disciplining them for the basic violation of strike breaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.084" offset="12781087">If the Court has no question, Mr. Gold will precede with the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.828" offset="12812016">Thank you Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.880" offset="12828317">Obviously, this case has a substantial importance of its own in light of the added strength that will either give to the employer or will not, but our interest -- my interest on behalf of the AFL-CIO is both that and another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.493" offset="12914730">And that is that in this case, the Board is operating on the premise, that where there is a policy which has been embodied in the Act in some respect, the Board can create an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.761" offset="12979827">Here, the policy that the Board finds in the Act in which we don’t dispute and of course which this Court discourse that on length in yesterday’s opinion on Bell Aerospace is the policy in favor of undivided loyalty of supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.331" offset="13042103">And from -- in order to effectuate that policy, the Board would read 8 (b) (1) (B) in an extremely expansive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.979" offset="13080660">Now, this is not the first time that the Board has made this type of leap from policy to the expansion of an unfair labor practice section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.722" offset="13143667">I think its worth noting that at the time the 1947 Amendments were being debated, the House came in with what was in essence a laundry list of union unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.654" offset="13215347">The Senate are, in the words of the Senate Report, reduced those to five defined unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.501" offset="13246798">And the reason that the evolution was as it was, was the fact that the case bill, which was a predecessor of the 47 Amendments had been vetoed and Senator Taft was very conscious to the fact that he face to another veto and had to get out a bill which would have a broad enough constituency to get 2/3 plus 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.664" offset="13347422">All these points have been made and most forcefully in our judgment in insurance agents and again in the Drivers Local case in 362 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.471" offset="13402593">In Insurance Agents, the union tactic there at issue was the slow down strike and there can be no doubt after this Court’s reaction to tactics like the sit down strike or other such tactics, that the policy of the Act does not favor that type of union economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.127" offset="13509277">The Board responded by reading into 8 (b) (3), which requires that there be a bargaining in good faith an unfair labor practice reaching of that tactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.103" offset="13565179">And this Court has responded by reversing the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.626" offset="13579285">I think its very much in point to note one facet of that opinion which is quoted on pages 15 and 16 of our brief which is the rest colored brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.172" offset="13633411">Mr. Justice Brennan thereby was responding to the argument that since the activity was unprotected, it was proper to make it an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.751" offset="13679804">And he said, “There was a little logic in assuming that because Congress was willing to allow employers to use self help against union tactics if they were willing to face the economic consequences of its use; it also impliedly declared these tactics unlawful as a matter of federal law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.011" offset="13760784">Our problem remains that of construing Section 8 (b) (3)’s terms and we do not see how the availability of self help to the employer has anything to do with the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.920" offset="13804460">And I think when we turn to the policy of undivided loyalty of supervisors, we find that once again, Congress met the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.906" offset="13844376">The issue posed by the Packard case by giving the employer a right of self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.902" offset="13872379">Sections 2 (3) to 2 (11) and 14 (a), where this matter was discussed and debated, do not create any employer rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.772" offset="13907801">As Mr. Cohen has indicated what they do is create a privilege in the employer that he doesn’t have to deal with unions as to a supervisors and that he does not have to bargain collectively with supervisors as to their terms and conditions of employment, and that the Board cannot make his refusal to treat supervisors as employees as an unfair labor practice and all of these to restore the situation before the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.280" offset="14057848">And we agree that the employer thereby was given a privilege to require supervisors not to join Unions, to require them to resign their membership without being subject to any unfair labor practice charges himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.195" offset="14129528">But it also, in the first portion of Section 14 recognized that employers had a right -- I don’t want to use that word here -- a privilege to allow their supervisors to remain in the Union or to deal with a Union about supervisory employees and that was the solution to the conflict of interest problem that Congress envisioned, envisaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.082" offset="14269127">Then let’s turn to 8 (b) (1) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.018" offset="14284800">In one respect, Congress was willing to go further than giving employers self-help, said that in selecting his representatives for collective bargaining and grievance handling functions, he could not be subjected to strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.614" offset="14351256">First of all, the main function of that provision was to deal with multi-employer bargaining and even there it was a compromise because the House had barred multi-employer bargaining, and again, the Senate’s solution was to accord both the -- in this case, both the employers and the Unions of privilege of continuing, but to say that neither could force the other into that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.553" offset="14466926">And the secondary purpose of this was to prevent Unions from exerting pressure on employers to select their representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.834" offset="14508095">Mr. Cohen has talked about the importance of the word “select”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.627" offset="14519275">I’d like to talk about the added importance of the word “representative.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.096" offset="14545084">If Congress had really been focusing on the conflict of interest problem that it focused on in 2 (3), 2 (11) and 14 (a), one would have thought that it would have used the same term in Section 8 (b) (1) (B) rather than pick out two specific subject matter areas, because as the Court of Appeals pointed out, the Board’s interpretation means that some supervisors that the employers assured through the Board’s processes, the loyalty of some supervisors but not as to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.659" offset="14699416">It seems to us in light of that, it’s more logical to assume that what Congress was intending was to assure that the employer would be able to speak through someone who is really his own choice just as the Union in Section 7 and 9 is assured that it will speak through a representative of its own -- of its own choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.240" offset="14781753">But to move that over into a completely different are, namely, whether the employer can act through certain agents in getting work done, rank-and-file work, as opposed to supervisory work or having grievances settled or collective bargaining done through his own people, is quite a leap, a leap which is extremely difficult, we think, to secure from the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.090" offset="14893140">When I perform a service in fixing a machine for an employer, it’s very difficult to say that I’m acting as its representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.741" offset="14935667">I am maybe part of management or whatever but I’m not acting as its representative for collective bargaining or the settlement of grievances; I’m acting as its agent in performing that type of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.311" offset="14986031">If that isn’t true, it would mean that any employee who comes back and does the rank-and-file work during the strike, thereby, ipso facto becomes a management representative under the Board’s theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3754.953" offset="15096581">Insofar as we are talking about the meaning of the word “representative,” representative for collective bargaining in grievance settling, it leaves open the question of whether the Board could say that it was empowered to prevent unions from disciplining individuals because they had interpreted the agreement in a way which was inconsistent with the members’ interest or had bargained in a particularly hard way or it pressed a grievance in a particularly hard way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.306" offset="15230015">We are not here asking that Oakland Mailers be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.565" offset="15258958">It may be that -- it should be reversed but that isn’t the issue here as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.884" offset="15284245">In the opening of our brief, we quoted the Chief Justice’s remarks in one of the obscenity cases last year that the fact that there has been an evolution doesn’t mean that the final step is right if it is one that never would have been contemplated in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.619" offset="15359269">We are at the far end of the spectrum here and we are simply asking this Court at this time to hold that the Board has made a mistake at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.112" offset="15397198">Now, obviously the reasoning that’s employed will have an effect on the earlier steps in the evolution but the reasoning that I’m arguing for now would not require an overruling of Oakland Mailers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3842.860" offset="15448189">Of course, it strikes me that that one possible difficulty with your position is if you read the language very narrowly and say that the Board has virtually no power to expand on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.503" offset="15506808">That leaves you way back before Oakland Mailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.954" offset="15516526">That may be a perfectly tenable position, but if you say the Board has some power to expand on it and can go as far as Oakland Mailers, it seems to me, if it’s rather hard to say why they shouldn’t go the last step.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="3871.656" offset="15563337">Well, I think the reason they can’t go the last step is the argument that I started off with and that is that whatever power the Board may have to interpret and expand a provision, it can't interpret or expand provisions into an interdiction or prohibition of the use of a lawful economic weapon during the strike unless there is a specific warrant in the legislative history, because this was the most sensitive area of the whole statute and the very point of Insurance Agents and Curtis Brothers is the point I’m just making, the point that’s embodied in Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.035" offset="15728849">And therefore, we need not take the position that there is no room for expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.910" offset="15752359">We simply take the position here that there is no room for an expansion whereby the Board would interfere with the use of this economic weapon when there is no indication that Congress intended to create a right in the employer to use anyone whether they’re labeled supervisory employees or representatives or anyone else to break a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.694" offset="15859566">Now, that doesn’t mean that the Board can’t go from the word “select” to a broader term in order to safeguard the employer’s interest in being able to speak through a representative of his own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.850" offset="15924140">That simply leaves that open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.556" offset="15930932">What we’re -- what I’m concentrating on here is the use of the word “representative” and the use or the misuse in our judgment of the word “representative” and the misuse in a way which strikes from the union’s hands and otherwise permissible economic weapon in support of a lawful economic strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="4651.523" offset="18682880">And it seems to me that really this part of your argument is almost a question begging.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.343" offset="18702106">That’s the issue here, isn’t it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="4657.822" offset="18708062">Well, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.528" offset="18710883">We don’t think it’s question begging because there’s nothing that we are arguing for that deprives the employer of any power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.841" offset="18748082">He has the power to order the supervisors to work, to order them to quit the union in order to -- so that, he will be sure that they are not subject to any countervailing pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.355" offset="18798132">The union has the attractiveness of keeping union membership in whatever discipline, and there is a tug-of-war and it’s no different than the tug-of-war that goes on as to the employee during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.904" offset="18844317">In many ways, this is a harsh process, but this is what Congress decreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.533" offset="18858841">An employee can be disciplined if he crosses a picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.509" offset="18874828">He can be permanently replaced if he does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.445" offset="18894576">Both sides have economic weapons but what the Board is trying to do is enhance the employer’s economic weapon by depriving the union of this, rather than according with what Congress would have seem to have done, which is to give both sides certain powers and privileges but not to create any federal rights or any federal prohibitions in this area when we are dealing with supervisors working during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.117" offset="18997185">And I -- with all deference, I don’t think it’s question begging.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.784" offset="19011918">I think that what we have in this area is the whole sensitive subject of the extent to which these five carefully limited at that time, five carefully limited union unfair labor practices, can be expanded, so that an economic weapon which Congress seems to have understood is there, namely, the right to discipline supervisor members is taken from the union in favor of a policy which was effectuated in other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.206" offset="19133544">Not effectuated by creating a federal right not created, not effectuated so far as we believe from anything in the language or legislative history by creating a federal prohibition in 8 (b) (1) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.152" offset="19193313">We do not argue with the fact that the employer has privileges here and that he can do what he can given the practical situation to keep his business running.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.080" offset="19233019">That is one of the things that’s allowed under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.515" offset="19242841">But the union can do what it can except insofar as Congress specifically said no to make its strike effective.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="4798.066" offset="19268963">And what this case is about is what can the union do!</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="4800.900" offset="19280353">That’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.269" offset="19281816">And we’re saying that there is nothing specific here that you have to take the word “select” and take the word “representative” and take all that -- the silence which we think here is -- would mean and take it into and turn all that into a section which says that a union cannot discipline a supervisor member who acts as an employer’s agent, and not as its representative and goes in and does track work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.530" offset="19402919">And we think that that is stretching the language in ignoring the legislative history to a point which cannot be done given the background of this Act and given the admonitions -- what the admonition contained in Section 13 which has been given flesh and force in cases such as Insurance Agents, the Drivers case and in American Ship and in H.K. Porter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.419" offset="19514410">This is not a principle which cuts just one way.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence J. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="4878.148" offset="19589329">Yes, that’s what I intended to address myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.318" offset="19626005">We believe that there is no impairment of the right to strike in the impermissible sense or to use Mr. Justice Stewart’s point, that is the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.914" offset="19736451">In Allis-Chalmers, what you had was the right of the union to discipline the employee members for breaking the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.659" offset="19783367">There is an old question that the right to maintain the solidarity of employee members is very vital to the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.285" offset="19829864">However, what you have here is the discipline of supervisor members and supervisory personnel have not traditionally been picket line allies of the rank-and-file, rather as the dissent in Packard noted, in industrial conflicts they’re allied with management.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.250" offset="19933727">So, therefore, in reading 8 (b) (1) (B) to the way the Board has in this case, you are not impairing the union’s interest to the same extent as you would, had you read Allis to 8 (b) (1) (a) to prohibit them from finding or disciplining employee strike breakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.209" offset="20041561">On the other hand, to fail to read 8 (b) (1) (B) as the Board has done here, would substantially impair the employer’s interest, which Congress clearly intended to protect, namely, of ensuring the undivided loyalty of its supervisors during a strike no less than at any other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.915" offset="20140408">Now, I think that the union’s concession that 8 (b) (1) (B) can be read to encompass the Oakland Mailers situation. Carry this a long way, along the road to sustaining the Board’s position, because it shows that Congress did not, as the Union argues in much of its brief and as the court below, the majority argued in much of its opinion, intend to leave the employer only with the option of insisting that his supervisors get out of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.747" offset="20319713">If they didn’t get out of the union, he then have to accept divided loyalty because the -- if Oakland Mailers is correct, the employer is protected against union discipline which interferes with the performance of that supervisor’s management functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.865" offset="20412186">And the question that we then come down to is whether or not the Board is reasonable in concluding that the performance of rank-and-file work during a strike is a proper function that management can require of its supervisors and whether to discipline them for that -- performance of that function is likely to have a spillover effect that is going to impair of that supervisor’s performance of grievance adjustment and other duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.907" offset="20564428">We submit that the Board was reasonable in so concluding, even though, another conclusion might have been equally reasonable, and therefore, the Board should be sustained in these cases.</text>
