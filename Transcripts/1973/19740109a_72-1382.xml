            <text syncTime="236.677" offset="1023478">I apologize for the oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.856" offset="1056183">The plaintiff below, the contract involved here, was Cerpac and Industrial, and Cerpac and Rich.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.152" offset="1089306">Rich being the general contractor, Cerpac being the supplier, and Industrial being supplier, was for standard manufactured plywood and a simple contract for the furnishing of that plywood was given from Rich to Cerpac, and in turn from Cerpac to Industrial, and Industrial caused the material, plywood, to be shipped directly to Rich’s job at the Beale Air Force Base in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.010" offset="1228800">What happened was that during the course of the job, that’s toward the end of it, Cerpac became in financial trouble went bankrupt despite the payments from Rich to with, and Industrial is now sought to bring a Miller Act suit seeking to collect for the plywood.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.549" offset="1342903">Now, the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit has adverted to the fact that Cerpac was an important member and subcontractor of the Rich Co., relying on the fact that not only that Cerpac have a contract to supply plywood, but it also had a separate contract to supply millwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.736" offset="1439660">The millwork issue was not at all in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.515" offset="1454811">In this case, it was only introduced and used in this case to point out that Cerpac was an important supplier and/or “subcontractor of the F.D. Rich Co.”</text>
            <text syncTime="357.109" offset="1505176">The fact is, however, that in this particular case, Industrial supplied plywood to Cerpac who in turn supplied the same plywood to Rich.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.808" offset="1555958">It would seem to be that at least since the MacEvoy decision in 322 U.S., that relationship can give rise to nothing but a materialman, and a supplier of a materialman under the Miller Act has long been understood to be too far to receive any relief under the Miller Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="396.151" stopTime="400.386">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="396.151" offset="1661388">A materialman can get a relief, but the supplier to the materialman cannot.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_gochberg" startTime="400.386" stopTime="833.979">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence Gochberg</label>
            <text syncTime="400.386" offset="1678315">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.918" offset="1680405">Anyone having a direct contract with the general contractor under 270b (a), a direct contract does not have to give notice and after 90 days of not being paid may bring a suit against the principal, which is the general contractor and at surety here, Transamerica.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.435" offset="1770475">And that’s whether he be a materialman or a subcontractor and it is unimportant, which he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.415" offset="1794403">However, if you do not have a direct contract with the general contractor, you can still get relief under the Miller Act bond if you have a contract with the subcontractor, and that goes from the language as interpreted by this Court in MacEvoy against United States, 322 U.S. 102, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.817" offset="1916029">And it really talks about the language in the case, which states that in the proviso that any person having a direct contractual relationship with the subcontractor but no contractual relationship express or implied with the contractor, that is the general contractor, furnishing said payment bond shall give notice and then goes on to say he has a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.495" offset="2022713">Now, the Court of Appeals in bringing in what was a really of strenuous matter is the fact that, there was a contract between Rich and Cerpac, under which Cerpac supplied no work.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.414" offset="2090423">By the way, the Court and it’s not borne out by anything in the findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.331" offset="2110067">The Court held that Cerpac installed the millwork, but that is completely untrue and it is not adverted to in the brief for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.863" offset="2152176">Well, be that as it may, we suggest to you that the proper test on the question of whether or not the Cerpac was a materialman or a subcontractor, is the test set forth by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Aetna Casualty Co. against Gibson Steel Co., 382 F.2d 615, in that case the supplier or the middle man was a metal supplied steel and iron products, and if fact customized some of the products.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.052" offset="2344960">He made ladders and deck plates, and switch plates, and various steel and iron products costumed for the particular government contract and supplied them, and the Court of Appeals held there that he was a materialman.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.905" offset="2408385">The virtue of adopting the Gibson Steel approach is that we don’t have to get into this almost future interest type of discussion of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.355" offset="2466168">A man is either a subcontractor or a materialman, and in the MacEvoy case, this Court held that if he takes over and is important and does a lot of the work, he may become a subcontractor, but if he is one that merely supplies material, he is a materialman.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.055" offset="2532937">The respondent has ceased in his brief on the fact that during a deposition, one of the officers of the F.D. Rich Co. stated that Cerpac was a subcontractor for the plywood.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.450" offset="2594586">I only point out to you that this Court in 322 U.S. in the MacEvoy case in Footnote 4 also stated that any use by the Court previous to that time of the loose use of the word “subcontractor materialman” by the Supreme Court would not be binding on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.339" offset="2674103">I ask the Court to view this in the -- that it is unimportant as to what Mr. Rich who was giving the deposition happened to call Cerpac.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.608" offset="2727184">What is important is an examination of what the function he did, and not what his relationship was but the function that he performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.787" offset="2767935">And his function was to supply plywood which he bought from Industrial, so, therefore as a materialman of the materialman, and clearly interdicted by the MacEvoy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.013" offset="2808790">Now, another question of that venue and then I want to come to the attorney’s fees question, which is of great interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.487" offset="2846720">On the question of venue, the statute very clearly says 270 -- 40 U.S.C. 270b (b), every suit instituted under this Section shall be brought in the name of the United States etcetera, in the Unites States District Court for any district in which the court was to be performed and executed, and not elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.316" offset="2954031">Now, starting with the language in Justice Brandeis' language in Illinois Surety Co. against the John Davis Co. which this Court then in a dictum used in the MacEvoy case at 322 U.S. in which you said that this Miller Act is a remedial statute and you ought to liberally construe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.839" offset="3052147">The lower courts have absolutely gone wild and they’ve liberally construed it so that they forgotten the language of the statute, and they have forgotten the ratio decidendi of the MacEvoy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.215" offset="3101571">The MacEvoy case, you clearly stated that even though it has to be liberally construed, there is no way to impose liability on a materialman or a materialman claim words of the statute may not be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.172" offset="3165414">Well, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit does not believe the ratio decidendi of the MacEvoy case and it has stated that even though two of the shipments involved here were sent by Industrial to South Carolina for a different contract, different federal contract on which there was a different surety that venue could be had in the District Court for California for recovery of those two shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.287" offset="3297907">The Court however realized that it was kind of embarrassing since Transamerica Insurance Co. was not the surety for the South Carolina job. [Laughter Attempt]</text>
            <text syncTime="814.817" offset="3336046">So it said “Alright, we’re holding that the principle under the Beale bond, i.e. the general contractor F.D. Rich Co. is liable, but we’re excusing Transamerica.”</text>
            <text syncTime="827.174" offset="3385469">Well, you know the bond is only one instrument where either you can’t be a little bit pregnant about this whether liable or were not liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.440" offset="3542518">Judge Wollenberg in the Roscoe case -- Judge Wollenberg in U.S. against Roscoe Ajax in 246 F. Supp. 439 has set down a splendid exposition of the venue statute, and he has said that the venue statute is jurisdictional and cannot be disregarded by the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.400" offset="3762364">The Congress of the United States said that anybody who wants to sue under the Miller Act must sue in the United States District Court for any district in which the contract was to be performed and executed and not elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.004" offset="3812728">We, lawyers and we lower courts, and hopefully not the Supreme Court, have introduced concepts of venue and jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.300" offset="3853897">I agree with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.655" offset="3859331">Judge Wollenberg agrees with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.071" offset="3865078">He says that it is not a venue problem; it's a jurisdictional problem and cannot be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.354" offset="3894126">In that case, he refused to allow two parties to change the venue that they had in a private contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.251" offset="3917740">You considered this question in passing in the Moseley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.346" offset="3946162">In Moseley, you considered it on the question where the contract had an arbitration clause and you considered the effect of arbitration, United States Arbitration Statute, on the Miller Act and on this jurisdictional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.648" offset="4007288">And there you send it back and it was inconclusive and never decided because there was a question of fraud and you held that it should go back to the District Court, but in a concurring opinion, I think it was concurring, the Chief Justice Warren pointed out that there were problems and Judge Wollenberg has dealt with that issue in the Roscoe Ajax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.264" offset="4129855">The most fascinating part of the Court of Appeals’ decision, aside from this venue question on which I submit they are clearly wrong, and on the question of the materialman, is the court’s action on attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.463" offset="4186593">The attorney fee question has been plaguing the lower courts and lawyers who represent surety companies as well as contractors for the last 10 or 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.049" offset="4256914">For a time there, nobody even thought that to ask for attorney’s fees, and then suddenly lawyers are starting to ask and, lo and behold, federal courts are beginning to grant attorney’s fees, this Court held in the Fleischmann case, Fleischmann against Maier involving the Lanham Act that only Congress, at least in our courts, gives attorney’s fees, and it’s pointed out that this has been that in American jurisprudence, attorney’s fees are not granted absent a specific statute or a contract which provides for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.694" offset="4427546">In that case the Lanham Act, you held that the Lanham Act set forth the remedies, and therefore that was the end of it and attorney’s fees could not be granted regardless of the public policy to encourage actions under Lanham Act or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.495" offset="4506749">In the Miller Act, in this case, the Court of Appeals has held relying on the Red Top Metal, Inc. case, the Fifth Circuit case and relying on the broad language of Mr. Justice Brandeis’ decision in the Illinois Surety Co. case that attorney’s fees should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.440" offset="4594521">And this is a curious situation, a curious result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.822" offset="4612075">The appellate, Intermediate Appellate Court in California in the Richter case quoted in the opinion of the Appellate Court has held that -- had held in another type of bond, not a Miller Act bond that the California Law had no application to a private construction projects or to projects of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.660" offset="4723357">The lower court followed that case, and the Appellate Court reversed and approved Judge MacBride, the Chief Judge of the Eastern District of California’s decision, which is cited in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.102" offset="4781140">The court approved this language and it held that federal law and hedl that under the policy of California Law, not its letter, attorney’s fees were recoverable and Miller Act cases to be taxed as costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.659" offset="4835370">Now, this situation was foresaw by the Red Top Metal’s case in which Judge Wisdom in a very well written decision with an erroneous result in the Fifth Circuit has reasoned through this whole question of the attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.905" offset="4916349">He reasoned and he said “Well no, you can’t look to state statute law, because the states aren’t legislating for Congress, and it really is a federal question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.767" offset="4955847">But he found that the Miller Act had a hiatus and we look to the state law to fill in the hiati, if that is the plural or the hiatuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.403" offset="5006315">He really did something that this Court seems to have done in the Electric Auto-Lite case involving the Section 14 (a) of the Security Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.961" offset="5060545">In that case if you recall, in finding that there was a private remedy under Section 14 (a), this Court also held that you could award attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.263" offset="5117806">And it held that it had a right to do so because Congress had left to you the question of interpretation of whether there is a private remedy under Section 14 (a) and therefore, you could write the entire remedy including the attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.629" offset="5175275">And you distinguished the Fleischmann case in which would clearly lay down a very clear line of law saying that where there’s a federal statute involved and the statute doesn’t involve attorney’s fees, the lower courts are not to grant them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.959" offset="6340545">I should like to pick up where counsel left off, namely with the attorney fee question and first apologize for an oversight in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.028" offset="6388820">I think I should have updated the California Code for the benefit of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.898" offset="6416300">The Government Code Section on attorney’s fees that has been referred to as this case has come forward is the Government Code Section 4207 by the 1970 statutes of California effective January 1, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.945" offset="6484532">In that code section you will find today is Civil Code Section 3250.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.358" offset="6510132">It was at this point that the California legislature brought together its government and civil code as it pertained to mechanics liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.226" offset="6565616">And I think at this point, it would be appropriate to hearken back to the type of question that Justice Rehnquist raised and that is, in California or perhaps it was Justice Blackmun and that is in California “Do you not get attorney’s fees because the Appellate Court of California says you do not get them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.579" offset="6659030">And our answer to that of course is, “No, the Intermediate Appellate Court in California in dicta made the comment that attorney’s fees under their Civil Code statute do not apply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.628" offset="6715246">That statute does not apply to a project of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.036" offset="6732904">That type of contention was first overcome in our view in Chevron Asphalt, the decision by Judge MacBride cited in our brief, when he points out that certainly that this Court could not be expected to look to a California statute to determine what the remedy is that’s afforded by Congress in a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.354" offset="6834155">What is the remedy that’s afforded a claimant on the Miller Act bond under the federal statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.072" offset="6897058">No, Your Honor, I think all that we’re saying and all that the Chevron Asphalt case has said, and all that the Ninth Circuit in our case has said is that case did not make such a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.276" offset="6945855">It has not for Miller Act purposes determined what “state law” is particularly when state law states at this Section 3250, the current point, that in any action the Court shall award to the prevailing party of reasonable attorney’s fee to be taxed as cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.696" offset="7027566">The troublesome angle in Chevron Asphalt was that the California legislature had seemed fit to make a distinction in its statutory scheme between a state government and a private state project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.077" offset="7085035">Therefore, in both Chevron Asphalt and the Ninth Circuit decision in our case they said “Look, we have a government project, California on a government project awards attorney’s fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.140" offset="7145326">And that’s kind of a way to back in to the point I want to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.493" offset="7166746">This Court is not being asked to affirm a judgment which says “you are entitled to attorney’s fees in a Miller Act case” that isn’t the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.177" offset="7217424">The point is, this Court is being asked to affirm a judgment which says “look to state law to make that determination”, why is that type of judgment necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.092" offset="7269146">Because the Miller Act does not provide the remedy, as my learned opponent has set forth, he would believe that the Miller Act somehow tells you what the nature of the recovery should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.591" offset="7323063">We submit that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.578" offset="7331109">It says “you shall receive the sums justly do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.128" offset="7349290">Contrast that with Maier-Fleischmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.604" offset="7367158">Under the Lanham Act, you’re entitled to all sorts of a detailed remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.429" offset="7382413">You get the defendant’s profits for example, plus your damages, plus there’s an elaborate provision whereby discretion in the district judge can increase or decrease the amount of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.436" offset="7430478">It’s a very detailed remedy and as pointed out by the Ninth Circuit in this decision, in that instance when Congress has taken the pains to detail exactly what’s going to happen, you should not imply another remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.862" offset="7488157">I think there’s another reason for it, and that in a sense is a pure federal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.298" offset="7521907">Its trademark law and what is the consequence of a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.074" offset="7544999">That isn’t our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.864" offset="7552209">If this Court or any court were to say “you get attorney’s fees” well, I guess this Court is the only one who could to do, we’re to say you get attorney’s fees in the Miller Act case that would be unfair in states that don’t award Miller Act cases on state projects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.183" offset="8045505">And I think I should mention is that the legislative note to 3250 points out that it is the intent of the legislature by this Act to change the basis for a decision of law denying attorney’s fees on appeal, so as to permit prevailing party to recover such fees on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.169" offset="8121469">It is that type of statute, that type of statutory determination by the legislature of the form of state that clearly expresses the policy of that state that the businessman in that state expect to do business under within the boundaries of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.335" offset="8198060">And the only thing that we’re suggesting is that the Miller Act was intended to replace that not to unfairly benefit federal government projects.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2045.834" offset="8260127">But, that isn’t the ground that Court of Appeals told you, is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.965" offset="8276637">It is, as I read, the Court of Appeals' opinion, it relied on the fact that under California Law, under California’s equivalent of the Miller Act where you’re working on a state project, you get attorney’s fees?</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.101" offset="8325120">As I read that opinion, they didn’t rely on the Section that you cite that you say now provides for attorney’s fees even in a private action.</text>

          <turn speaker="dennis_s_harlowe" startTime="2069.719" stopTime="2342.079">
            <label>Mr. Dennis S. Harlowe</label>
            <text syncTime="2069.719" offset="8355631">Yes, Your Honor the one point that we made there that did not prevail in the Court of Appeals, perhaps I shouldn’t say not prevail, you notice on a footnote in their decision they say that we urged at that time that it should be made retroactive if that’s necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.009" offset="8420833">And the Ninth Circuit in this case said “No, we’re not even going to enter into a retroactivity type of question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.282" offset="8449881">Because they felt that was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.777" offset="8459807">They took the same position that Judge MacBride took in Chevron Asphalt, namely if you get it on a state government project, you get it on a federal government project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.681" offset="8507455">And we’re not going to concern ourselves and as Judge MacBride points out he says “I don’t know why California wants to make a distinction like that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.146" offset="8537339">And as it turned the state legislature of California subsequently agreed with him, so even prior to the time of the judgment on remand in this case, we have that combination where attorney’s fees are available in both sides of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.216" offset="8617587">Without cutting this too short, I would like to make an observation on the argument urged by my opponent in connection with the status of Cerpac as a contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.748" offset="8675788">I think the facts are exhaustively presented in the findings and conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.658" offset="8699402">The reason for that was this case was tried as a companion to a prior case with similar parties involved and it was possible to do it largely by stipulation in the record, and we wanted to set out at that point what it was that the documentation showed, and a few of the factors that should be rehearsed are the very ones that counsel has emphasized in the Aetna case is showing the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.540" offset="8798877">And that is in this case, we’ve got a contractor who worked under a contract agreement, received progress payments for specific and substantial sections of the work at a fixed price with progress payments in a continuing relationship and guaranteed against defects and workmanship in material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.887" offset="8884245">All of which, in addition to a vast number of other details of the relationship that are set forth in our brief, without question, show that Cerpac is a contract -- subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.495" offset="8950700">Going behind that however, is the finding of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.273" offset="8969822">Again, one that was not necessary to the decision at the Ninth Circuit, and that finding was that there was a direct implied relationship between Rich and Industrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.584" offset="9035128">And that relationship had its germination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.318" offset="9045995">You can go back to the findings of the trial judge as early as May, and during the course of their relationship in 1966, it was perfectly clear to the parties at that time what it was they wanted the contract for, what each party was expecting to have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.146" offset="9121332">Unfortunately, our client fulfilled his half of it and did not get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.936" offset="9144529">That was the implied contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.768" offset="9151843">That was the meeting of the minds that the district judge found that the Ninth Circuit courts did not rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.274" offset="9185802">It could not say those findings were clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.201" offset="9197505">It simply found that it had another issue to meet, and that is the one of the subcontractor status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.143" offset="9221329">And the reason that question came up was principally so our opponents at that time could argue they had not have timely notice of our claim, when the essence of it was they had had notice far prior to the time they get into conceding to us that they owe us for the last two shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.918" offset="9296457">As far as the venue question is concerned urged here as being jurisdictional, I think the authority set forth in our brief adequately handle that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.406" offset="9338358">I would like to emphasize that the bonding company with Miller Act coverage on this project correctly we believe by the Ninth Circuit, was not subjected to liability for the shipments to South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.198" offset="9393528">The prime contractor was we feel that was correctly done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.976" offset="9428637">And I think that would be adequate for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.560" offset="9438981">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.063" offset="9549009">The defendant is a Connecticut Corporation and the work that was performed was not performed under any contract or direct relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.008" offset="9608777">Had they had a direct contract, and had we under the conflicts of law look to that contract, we might be applying the law which we usually write into our direct contracts that this shall be governed by Connecticut Law, or Washington Law, or Texas Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.783" offset="9691847">Yes, I understand that, but I am not -- but I am pointing out to you that there is a vice in my opinion in allowing the various state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.251" offset="9733747">In Texas, you get attorney’s fee -- you don’t get attorney’s fees, in California, in Alaska that you do, Louisiana you don’t in Florida, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.873" offset="9760287">The other point on attorney’s fees and the spirit of the law, I would like to -- there is a Trade Secrets case that I saw though this morning, very interesting one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.310" offset="9798008">But the Ninth Circuit has considered this question in the Trade Secret case in the Midwest Co. against Kaiser Aluminum 407 F.2d 288, it is not in my brief, a 1969 case where the Court of Appeals held against granting attorney’s fees in a Trade Secret case, finding there was no compelling public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.674" offset="9891422">Why there’s a compelling public interest in Miller Act cases escapes me, I’ve never understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.882" offset="9924232">I do think it is Mr. Justice Brandeis’ words as re-promulgated by this Court in MacEvoy, which has given a false direction to the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.606" offset="9971148">I want to bring out the Monroe Port case on the question of the subcontractor and the relationship of Cerpac.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.971" offset="10004584">There is nothing that was said by my learned brother as to Cerpac’s status which applies to the plywood which is here under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.185" offset="10053486">It was a separate contract for the plywood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.044" offset="10064875">It was simply invoiced separately and shipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.927" offset="10080444">In the Monroe Port case and decided in the First Circuit, you will recall that the First Circuit upheld in the necessity for giving a 90-day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.701" offset="10123598">Even though the Miller Act claimant was a direct subcontractor of the plaintiff, but there he had done some work for another subcontractor and thus he had, for that portion of work, been a subcontractor of the subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.053" offset="10196950">He was also a direct subcontractor of the general contractor, and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Monroe Port held that he had to give the 90-day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.774" offset="10243866">And I hold that whatever Cerpac may have been in relationship to Rich insofar as the millwork, although I think he’s still a materialman there too, but those facts are not before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.999" offset="10292767">He certainly cannot be considered to be a subcontractor for plywood.</text>
