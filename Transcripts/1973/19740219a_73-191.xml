            <text syncTime="238.014" offset="1028807">I would begin by stating what I would like to think of as a starting point for analysis of the issues here that laid down in Euclid v. Ambler, that a state may legitimately have a one-family zone as sep -- community, may legitimately have a one-family zone as distinguished from a two-family detached, as distinguished from apartments, commercial, light industrial and so on down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.829" offset="1128072">If that is true, and if the one-family zone which this town has a right to enact, if the one-family zone is to have any meaning, you have the problem of an unlimited number of persons assembling under the roof in the one-family house.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.892" offset="1204349">I suppose the village has a couple of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.660" offset="1219396">It could just forget about its one-family zone and have no limit on the number of people of any type that could live in a building.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.229" offset="1257639">I don't think it's required to throw out its one-family zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.593" offset="1275089">Or as plaintiffs suggest in their brief, they could have an across the broad limit, a maximum number of people can live in the house according to the number of bedrooms or some other formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.393" offset="1326289">Across the board!</text>
            <text syncTime="314.907" offset="1336424">The consequences of this suggestion would be to penalize larger families, families with children for example in excess of the number of bedrooms in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.510" offset="1382818">Whether it would be constitutional for a village to do this, I don't even discuss. Certainly, a village as at liberty not to make that policy judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.536" offset="1418867">At this point, I think we come to the crux issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.122" offset="1433287">Are there any circumstances in which the village can treat the family because of what it is, because of the value it has for our society, can it treat the family different from the unrelated group.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.038" offset="1476859">And the third alternative is the one the village adapted here, to have a numerical limitation on the number of unrelated people, but no numerical limitation on families counting on the normal expectancy that families tend to remain within a certain range, whereas there is no such expectancy or predictable size of group in the case of unrelated individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.999" offset="2040790">700 people, Your Honor and approximately 220 homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.685" offset="2063464">The consequences of the plaintiffs' argument on this branch of the case apparently would be and I can’t see anyway around it that they would say, it's unconstitutional to have a governmental entity endowed with zoning power unless that governmental body itself could accommodate the full range of zoning uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.836" offset="2148101">This -- just the argument is that since Belle Terre consists solely of one-family residences.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.761" offset="2175791">It shouldn't be able to zone unless it can accommodate other users.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.643" offset="2195331">This is a -- an astonishing proposition that would render innumerable zoning ordinances all across the country unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.807" offset="2235977">It would negate the value of local economy which this Court so recently emphasized in the San Antonio School District case.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.245" offset="2277773">Why this astonishing conclusion is pressed on this Court apparently is that the plaintiff's belief that if Belle Terre is allowed to have its one family zone, then other communities will zone them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.466" offset="2346632">Mind you, the argument is not that this is the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.353" offset="2362201">On the contrary, Judge Dooling made his finding of fact down below, that Belle Terre is a tiny unit within a large area of permissibly zoned area.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.756" offset="2419775">He made the finding that the town of Brook Haven within which the university is and within which the village is, that the town of Brook Haven, even its highest zoning district would accommodate the residential use engaged in by the plaintiff students.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.311" offset="2493962">So the argument is not that under the present existing circumstances, the students have been deprived of a meaningful and appropriate place to reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.813" offset="2528026">The argument is that it might become so in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.228" offset="2545685">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals accepted this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.507" offset="2566792">I think this turns upside down, the presumption of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.515" offset="2590824">We have a tradition that if any state of facts might be conceived, that would make the operation of a law reasonable then the law is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.345" offset="2630113">The Court of Appeals reversed this upside down that if any state of facts might be conceived in future by which the operation of a law become unreasonable, then the law must be held valid, void, presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.588" offset="2699076">Now of course, the Village of Belle Terre excludes two-family houses, but no one is in a panic thinking that Havens, if Belle Terre excludes two-family houses, there'll be no place for two-family houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.611" offset="2751216">The plaintiff group consisting of unrelated people is not the kind of suspect minority which this Court contemplated in the Old Caroline Products case, Footnote 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.528" offset="2802834">They are numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.410" offset="2806387">They are articulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.244" offset="2809731">They are educated.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.476" offset="2814642">They are mobile in the sense that members of this group become members of families and back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.905" offset="2836376">So, they are the very opposite of the kind of helpless minority in whose behalf, strict or special judicial scrutiny is invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.970" offset="2876604">The plaintiffs on -- at a couple of points in their brief try to impute to the village some sort of judgment that individuals living in group are per se socially undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.445" offset="2934491">I suppose, they are trying to come close to the Marino case recently decided by this Court which said that the State has no legitimate interest in punishing politically unpopular groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.773" offset="2983811">Well of course, that would be the antithesis of a bill of attainder and no one would assert that as a constitutionally permissible purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.339" offset="3026129">But this kind of division that they try to impute to the village, that we in the village, the families are the good guys and groups are somehow the bad guys, the social undesirables that are excluded, that are out.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.400" offset="3098331">This distorts totally the kind of fine-tuned judgments that are made in zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.384" offset="3134276">If you have a zone for one-family residential community, that does not express a judgment that people living in two-family houses are undesirables.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.368" offset="3186207">It excludes a monastery, 50 monks living in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.315" offset="3201985">There's no judgment that the 50 monks are undesirables.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.259" offset="3217763">It's a rather fine-tuned judgment that certain users are more appropriately put off into one zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.169" offset="3269381">The plaintiffs use the epithet separate but equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.622" offset="3287249">Well an epithet has an odium connected with it because of its legal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.621" offset="3307207">But logically, the concept separate but equal, I must admit, is the concept of zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.485" offset="3338658">I think in this case that of all of the opinions written below, the most acute statement was that of Judge Dooling in the District Court, in the jurisdictional statement, page 88, in which he said, "The essence of zoning is that its selection is not regarded as invidiously discriminatory against users not selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.020" offset="3456836">Zoning presupposes that convenient and fitting locations can be found for every legitimate land use so that no pursuit of any use is denied of disparaged."</text>
            <text syncTime="857.657" offset="3507409">Now, you can call that separate, but equal if you will, but that's what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.449" offset="3530501">The exclusion of one land use from Zone X is not the kind of invidious judgment that excluding unrelated groups from food stamp programs is.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.133" offset="3597270">To exclude unrelated groups from food stamp programs does not put any bread and nourishment in the stomachs of families.</text>
