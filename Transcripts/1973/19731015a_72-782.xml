            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments next in 72-782 Gateway Coal Company against the United Mine Workers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard L. Scheinholtz</label>
            <text syncTime="62.959" offset="328620">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.712" offset="343562">The primary issue in this case is whether a Federal Court acting under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 as amended, has the authority to order arbitration of an alleged safety dispute, and to enjoin a work stoppage which gave rise to that dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.439" offset="450456">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in a 2:1 decision, vacated a preliminary injunction issued by the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.713" offset="495595">The District Court acting on the complaint of Gateway Coal Company had issued an order directing arbitration of a dispute as to whether the Gateway Mine was rendered unsafe by reason of the presence of two foremen in the mine, had directed that the foreman be suspended pending arbitration, and had issued an injunction preventing the Gateway employees from continuing a work stoppage and furtherance of that dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.710" offset="623595">The sequence of events leading to the District Court's order began on April 15th of 1971, when shortly before daylight, it was reported and discovered that in one working area of the Mine there was a reduction in airflow.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.483" offset="694648">There was still an adequate supply of air substantially above the Federal and State minimum requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.300" offset="725995">No one had noticed any difference in the methane level in the mine which was normally two tenths of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.714" offset="759641">Substantially below the minimum requirements of Federal law of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.650" offset="783360">Methane is detected every 20 minutes, there is a requirement of Federal law that the operators check for methane.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.351" offset="822126">No one had noticed any diminution or rather, any increase in the methane level.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.532" offset="842919">There are also methane monitors on the cutting machines which are to detect changes of methane, and no one had noticed any change in the methane level.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.422" offset="886387">The problem was traced to a partial blockage of an intake airway, which is believed to have occurred at 4:30 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.146" offset="917316">This resulted in a slight short circuiting of the airflow in this working area of the Mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.686" offset="943543">Repairs were made immediately and the normal airflow was restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.427" offset="962456">The miners who had reported to work on the first shift which begins at 8 a.m. were held on the surface until the repairs were completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.747" offset="1003729">They were told to standby however, a number of them, approximately half of the workforce left.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.970" offset="1028598">The remainder of the workforce went in at about 10:30 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.471" offset="1046674">And the mine worked without incident until the following morning when the first shift employees reported again.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.603" offset="1075200">At that time, when those who had left the mine, contrary to instructions, found out that they were not to receive reporting pay, they struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.940" offset="1112503">They refuse to arbitrate, they struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.642" offset="1123265">Subsequently, the union requested that the Federal and Safety Inspectors, come in to inspect concerning the adequacy of the repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.465" offset="1162658">This was done on Saturday April the 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.795" offset="1179899">In the course of that inspection, the inspectors discovered that the three third shift foreman had failed to notice and detect the reduction in airflow which was caused by the fall of an overcast, which is believed to have occur at 4:30 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.005" offset="1264744">The pre-shift examination should have taken place between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.073" offset="1297032">The following day on April the 18th, the union had a special meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.188" offset="1317512">And at that meeting the union attended by approximately 200 of the 550 miners of the Gateway Mine, the men voted not to work with the foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.544" offset="1370906">By this time the company Gateway had suspended two of the foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.766" offset="1391804">However the third foreman had to determine not to suspend pending further investigation, because he was the one that had reported the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.316" offset="1425972">They felt that he was in a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.846" offset="1436108">However, the Company reluctantly agreed to the union's demand that it suspend all three foremen, but the company president advised the district president of the UMW that when there was any basis for him to put the three foremen back to work, when the State clarified their certification status that he intended to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.129" offset="1529313">At that time he believed that action would be taken to determine their certification status and under Pennsylvania law, a foreman cannot work without being certified, and there's a procedure for revocation of certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.706" offset="1587618">There was also a possibility, and it turned out to be an actuality that the men would be subject to criminal misdemeanor charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.419" offset="1630459">The men returned to work on April the 19th and worked without incident until June the 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.630" offset="1659298">In the meantime, the criminal misdemeanor charge was filed against the foreman, and on April 29th or rather on May 29th the company received a letter from the Department of Environmental Resources advising the company that it did not intend to revoke the certifications status of the miners or rather the three foremen, and at the company was at liberty to return the foreman to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.268" offset="1785835">Acting on this letter, which as I indicated went to the union with the copy to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.509" offset="1810808">The company reinstated the two foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.823" offset="1824078">One had retired in the meantime on June the 1st, and upon the Act of the company in returning the foreman to work, the union struck, took unilateral action and struck.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.632" offset="1899311">About six weeks later, the two or the three foremen pleaded nolo contender, and they were fined I believe $200 a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.433" offset="1938495">Nothing was ever done with respect to the certification status of the active foreman, because the Department of Environmental Resources decided that the criminal processes were inadequate method of resolving the problem.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="482.422" offset="2006413">Well now, what is the company's position with respect to the strike?</text>
            <text syncTime="486.080" offset="2021042">That is the reason for it, was it the reinstatement of the foreman, or was it the earlier company position not to allow pay?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_l_scheinholtz" startTime="496.832" stopTime="572.149">
            <label>Mr. Leonard L. Scheinholtz</label>
            <text syncTime="496.832" offset="2064091">The dispute had its origins in the reporting pay issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.608" offset="2083213">The strike that started on April the 17th started before there was any or rather on April the 16th, started before there was any knowledge of any problem with respect to foreman's logs.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.817" offset="2132010">However, after the strike started initially over this reporting pay dispute, it was converted into a safety dispute or an alleged safety dispute by the union. Our position is that the dispute as to whether the mine was rendered unsafe by the foreman, is clearly one which is subject to resolution under the collective bargaining agreement between Gateway and the UMW.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.421" offset="2238380">This collective bargaining agreement contains a very broad grievance arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.348" offset="2262100">It would be difficult to write a broader grievance arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.884" offset="2288327">The contract states that the parties will submit to the settlement of local and district disputes procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.339" offset="2322077">All disputes between them as to the meaning and application of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.081" offset="2341094">All other local matters and any local trouble of any kind arising at the mine.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.983" offset="2536699">There is a specific period of experience he must have in the mine.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.989" offset="2584660">There is also a procedure under Pennsylvania Law for revocation of that status, and if his license to practice as a supervisor in the mine is revoked, then it's a little bit like a driver's license he can't drive.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.895" offset="2784340">The District Court in enjoining the work stoppage, as I say, directed arbitration of this dispute, which was whether the mine was rendered unsafe by reason of the presence of the foreman in the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.663" offset="2835435">And he directed that the foreman be suspended until the arbitration was held, and that if the arbitrator sustained the company's position that the foreman be returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.485" offset="2886740">If the arbitrator found against the company, then they wouldn't be returned to work, which I think was a very sensible solution under the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="715.660" offset="2939402">He found in agreement with the District Court that the dispute was arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.979" offset="2956643">That was the first issue that the union presented to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.366" offset="2966256">They challenged the arbitrability, he found that it was arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.945" offset="2980571">Secondly, he found that the decision of the Gateway Miners to refuse to work with the foreman was unfounded, and he also found that the mine was not rendered unsafe by reason of the presence a foreman in the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.352" offset="3046191">However, when the case got to the Court of Appeals which was after the arbitrator's decision, the majority of the Court ruled that the dispute was not arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.087" offset="3093107">The conclusion of the Court was the safety disputes are sui generis, and by virtue of their being sui generis that the ordinary presumption of arbitrability of disputes set forth in 203 (d) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, and as stated in Warrior and Gulf and the other cases in the Steelworker trilogy, did not apply to a dispute regarding safety.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.523" offset="6630818">I'm somewhat appalled that counsel has indicated to this Court precisely what he thinks about Norris LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.413" offset="6678361">Throughout 25 minutes of argument, counsel has failed to even mention the words "The Norris LaGuardia Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.864" offset="6716186">This Court -- the question before this Court is whether your decision in Boys Markets should be extended to cover a safety disputed coal mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.056" offset="6776999">This Court carved out in the words of Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.093" offset="6797166">Very limited exception the Norris LaGuardia Act, counsel has failed to even mention the words of Norris LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.942" offset="6836558">The basic charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.517" offset="6842828">The Magna Carta of American Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.606" offset="6855158">What we have in this case is the coal industry and particularly the Gateway Mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.489" offset="6886713">Not once in counsel's argument has he mentioned the fact the Gateway Mine is classified by the United States Bureau of Mines as an especially hazardous coal mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.621" offset="6939272">Not once has he mentioned the fact that at that mine, there is liberated daily 4 million cubic feet of deadly methane gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.998" offset="6996741">Nor does counsel mention that at the Gateway Mine, it's one of the largest underground mining complexes in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.304" offset="7033940">That the failure of these foreman interrupted the airflow to the five phase area of that mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.309" offset="7069989">Now, counsel has said here that their regular requirements in the five phase area, the regular ventilation requirements were 28,000 cubic feet per minute at the last open crosscut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.028" offset="7128816">The federal minimum ventilation standard is 9,000 cubic feet per minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.480" offset="7154625">The State minimum standard is 6,000 cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.740" offset="7171657">It gives Your Honor, some idea of the gassy nature of this mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.624" offset="7191197">The Federal Bureau of Mines was requiring them to pump three times the minimum amount of air into that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.961" offset="7232575">The law requires the 1969 Coal Mining Health and Safety Act, requires foreman that are working on the shift, to protect the safety of the men coming into the mine, to make a pre-shift examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.801" offset="7299971">That inspection must be carried out within three hours prior to the commencement of that shift.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.161" offset="7381368">These foreman purportedly made that test and they logged into their logbooks 28,000 cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.480" offset="7426717">The record in this case conclusively demonstrates that this overcast fell around 4 a.m. in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.891" offset="7464333">Counsel would now seem to be arguing here contesting that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.110" offset="7485231">He didn't argue it in the District Court, because there was a water gauge on the main fan of that mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.737" offset="7511667">And when that resistance was created when that overcast fell, it showed up on that water gauge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.444" offset="7538521">This conclusively established in this record that that overcast fell, and that it fell before the foreman were required to make their pre-shift examination including the testing for ventilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.471" offset="7598602">Now, counsel has not said that the Boys Markets case decided by this Court, involved in economic dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.183" offset="7633502">The question before this Court as you recall, was whether or not supervisors were performing bargaining unit work by stocking shelves in the supermarket in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.293" offset="7697972">The case here involves coal miners and the words of Justice Hastie, "Men in an industry which is dangerous at best."</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.783" offset="7743843">This mine classified by the Federal Bureau of Mines as especially hazardous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.017" offset="7768816">Counsel does not say that in the Boys Markets case, it was admitted before this Court that the grievance could be submitted -- should have been submitted to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.244" offset="7817718">Here there is a very serious dispute that has started in the District Court and still exists here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.263" offset="13837793">First, his reference to the fact that Mr. Kegel, the President of Gateway, testified that there had never been or he did not recall any arbitration over safety with respect to Gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.517" offset="13890769">That in itself is meaningless, because Mr. Kegel also testified that he believed that there had been safety disputes arbitrated under this agreement with other companies, and in fact the brief submitted amicus curiae by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association at Pages 15 to 16 states that at least 40 cases have been submitted to arbitration under the 1968 agreement in the three years preceding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.352" offset="14014171">Secondly, I do not even read the respondent's brief is saying that safety disputes are not arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.549" offset="14042906">What they say is, in their brief that they have the choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.352" offset="14058162">That they have the right to either submit them to arbitration, or elect to strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="3541.771" offset="14243840">Thier argument, as Mr. Yablonski states, is he says that by virtue of the fact that the Mine Safety Programs states that the removal of the Mine Safety committee can be subject to arbitration that this impliedly excludes all other types of safety disputes.</text>
