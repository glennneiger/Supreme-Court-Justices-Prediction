            <text syncTime="29.741" offset="195709">In 73-556, 73-795, these cases are both here on writs of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.455" offset="254537">Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act, makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.301" offset="333949">The respondent unions in these consolidated cases called economic strikes against the employer companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.286" offset="365923">During the strikes, supervisory employees of the companies, some of whom were members of bargaining units and some of whom were not, but all of whom were union members, crossed the picket lines and performed rank and file struck work, that is work normally performed by the non-supervisory employees then on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.581" offset="455053">The unions later disciplined these supervisory members for so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.996" offset="476682">The question to be decided as whether the unions committed unfair labor practices under Section 8 (b) (1) (B) when they disciplined their supervisor members for crossing the picket lines and performing rank and file struck work, during lawful economic strikes against the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.572" offset="555050">We granted certiorari because this is a novel and an important question under federal labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.559" offset="587024">For the reasons set out at some length in the written opinion filed today, we agree with the Court of Appeals that these actions of the unions did not violate that provision of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.684" offset="631536">Accordingly the judgments before us are affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.450" offset="646583">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion which has been subscribed to by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
