            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="18.772" offset="151824">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.645" offset="167288">This is a direct appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington dismissing after trial a government civil anti-trust suit challenging a bank merger under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.137" offset="237296">The acquiring bank, the National Bank of Commerce at Seattle is both the second largest bank in the State of Washington and the second largest bank in the City of Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.869" offset="288183">The acquired bank, the Washington Trust Bank, is the third largest bank in the City of Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.131" offset="317231">It is conceded that the two banks are not in competition with each other because the National Bank of Commerce does not operate in the City of Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.565" offset="359027">That is in the metropolitan area of Spokane, which the District Court held to be the relevant geographic market in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.787" offset="391941">The theory upon which the Government challenged this merger was that the National Bank of Commerce was a significant potential entrant into the City of Spokane and that by going in for through a major firm in Spokane, the effect of this maybe substantially to lessen competition by eliminating an important potential competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.677" offset="495491">The Court had a similar question before it last term in the Greeley Bank case of Colorado in which by an equally divided Court, it affirmed the District Court’s judgment in that case dismissing the Government’s complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.922" offset="552438">And the United States has brought this case here and brought the question back to the Court because a major effort of the Department of Justice in recent years has been attempting to stop what we consider a very serious trend in the banking industry under which large banks headquartered in the major cities of the state are acquiring market leaders in local and regional markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.735" offset="663719">This is a relatively new phenomenon in banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.649" offset="679393">In the 1950’s, we had a great wave of bank mergers in which bank in the same city who are competitors would combine.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.902" offset="712307">That trend basically stopped after this Court’s decision of Philadelphia Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.527" offset="734877">And what is been happening in recent years is that more and more throughout the country, banks, the major banks have been around the state acquiring a large number of significant banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.822" offset="788062">And the effect of this trend is to bring more and more of a state’s banking resources under the control of a small number of banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.608" offset="827141">In the State of Washington itself, for example, 75% of all the deposits are now controlled by five banking organizations, even though there are some 90 different banking organizations in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.088" offset="885133">In some states, it’s even more concentrated, a smaller number of banking organizations hold a larger percentage of the shares of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.981" offset="928705">And the government believes that if this trend is permitted to continue, the inevitable result will be a significant and serious diminution of competition in the banking industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.697" offset="987533">Since 1968, the Government has brought 20 cases in which it has challenged bank acquisitions on the theory that it eliminated the potential competition which the acquired bank was likely to supply in our view in the market where it made the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.928" offset="1072483">Now, let me just briefly refer to --</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="253.841" offset="1092127">That the acquiring bank is the substantial competitor and it eliminates potential competition which it would supply in the market into which it goes through the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.229" offset="1137685">Now let me just briefly refer to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.468" offset="1146671">The National Bank of Commerce is a very large bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.912" offset="1160359">As I have indicated, it is the second largest bank in both the State of Washington and in the City of Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.143" offset="1185332">It has net assets of $1.8 billion and its deposits are more than $1.6 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.498" offset="1214694">It has approximately 22% of all the bank deposits in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.089" offset="1237055">It operates a 107 branch offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.708" offset="1251579">The acquired bank, the Washington Trust Bank, is the third largest in the City of Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.712" offset="1279582">It has total assets of $112 million, deposits of $95 million and has eight offices in the City of Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.312" offset="1322005">So, it itself is a very substantial bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.427" offset="1338410">It is a prosperous bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.851" offset="1348127">In the five-year period from 1966 to 1971, its totaled deposits increased 60%; its total loans increased 70%.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.028" offset="1388878">It’s considerably a well-managed bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.148" offset="1397342">It pays very high salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.436" offset="1410508">The Spokane area in which the bank operates is itself a prosperous and growing area although admittedly not growing as fast other areas of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.690" offset="1463484">The District Court found in the parties who are in agreement that commercial banking is the relevant product market in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.399" offset="1498384">Commercial banking in the State of Washington is extremely concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.043" offset="1516878">As I’d indicated, the five largest banks have 75% of all the deposits and additionally have 60% of the banking offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.876" offset="1556271">The two largest banks, one of which is the National Bank of Commerce and the other is the Seattle First National Bank together, have approximately half of all deposits and more than one-third of all the banking offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.505" offset="1614785">This pattern of concentration is repeated throughout the state but not surprisingly when you get into smaller cities, it becomes even more concentrated, and in Spokane, the three leading banks have 92% of all the deposits and loans, and there’s almost as higher concentration in the Eastern part of the State of Washington which is geographically separated from the Western part of the State by a very high mountain range.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.112" offset="1729202">Now, in 1971, the two banks submitted to the comptroller an application to merge the Washington Trust Bank, the Bank in Spokane, into National Bank of Commerce, the Seattle Bank and the second largest bank in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.357" offset="1794194">In accordance with the requirements of the statute, the view’s resort of the two other bank regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice, all three of these groups advised the comptroller that in their view the merger would substantially lessen competition primarily because of its tendency to increase concentration in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.499" offset="1886772">The comptroller, however, approved the merger and the Government filed this suit, which had the effect of staying the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.861" offset="1916238">After a lengthy trial, the District Court from the bench gave a brief opinion in which he announced that he was holding against the Government on all of its claims and would dismiss the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.871" offset="1968274">Following this in accordances with his request, the defendants submitted detailed proposed findings which the District Court adopted without any change.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.185" offset="2013518">The theory of the Government’s case was that the National Bank of Commerce could end the Spokane by alternative means, specifically either by making a so-called toehold entry of a smaller bank or by, in effect, opening a branch through a procedure that I will discuss shortly known as sponsoring a bank and subsequently then acquiring it.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.804" offset="2123964">The District Court made the following rulings in rejecting our case: First, the District Court held that although there is a high level of concentration in Spokane, nevertheless the market is competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.345" offset="2178090">This is on the basis of expert testimony that in fact there’s a great deal of competition in the market because of the large number of sub sizable banking organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.690" offset="2219468">Then the District Court held that there was no reasonable likelihood that the National Bank of Commerce would end the Spokane either by sponsoring the bank or by making a toehold acquisition and that this merger was the only way the bank could get in.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.322" offset="2286028">Then the Court held that there was no reasonable likelihood that the Washington Trust Bank itself might expand outside of the Spokane region.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.377" offset="2326256">This was another theory on which we urged that the merger would substantially lessen competition by eliminating potential competition or that the bank would join other banks in forming a new holding company, a smaller holding company that might compete against the large banks in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.204" offset="2397518">And finally, the Court held that even if this merger had, as he discussed, the Court describe that some oral of the anticompetitive effects which the Government alleged nevertheless those effects would clearly outweigh by the effect of the merger in meeting the convenience and needs of the Spokane community.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.361" offset="2482155">I will discuss these four grounds in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.206" offset="2501590">Now, last term in the Falstaff case, this Court left open the question as it phrased it, whether a merger would violate Section 7 on the ground that the acquiring company and I now quote “could but did not entered de novo or through toehold acquisition and that there is less competition, then there would have been had entry been in such a manner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="634.822" offset="2616007">We think this case presents that question and we urge that the Court should answer it affirmatively, and then, on the principle, it should hold that this merger does violate Section 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.763" offset="2667833">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.506" offset="2670759">At some point, I take it, you will discuss the relationship between this transaction in the Falstaff case an unregulated business and a banking, the National Bank, which is regulated.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="664.070" offset="2733035">Let me deal with that right now Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.365" offset="2750171">It is true there is regulation of banking, but this Court in the Philadelphia Bank case has indicated its view that it thinks that the basic principles, the governing Section 7, particularly the stress on market structure and concentration, are equally applicable to banking, even thought it is a regulated industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.975" offset="2836689">The fact that there is regulation means there is not quite the same ease of entry into the market as in an unregulated industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.913" offset="2868349">But nevertheless, we still think it is important to preserve -- to preserve these alternative sources of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.797" offset="2911922">And, we don’t think that the fact that the comptroller has indicated that he doesn’t think he would approve a merger on the basis on what he now knows without any application or in this case that he’s assistant, the Regional Administrator testified that he didn’t think there was any reasonable likelihood that a new charter would be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.785" offset="2991856">We don’t think that that is enough to overcome the significant effects upon concentration in banking that exist, and that for which we think this kind of entry poses the only possibility of some help.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.319" offset="3078060">The same argument, of course, was equally applicable in the Philadelphia Bank case, in the Phillipsburg case where, again, you had to have regulatory approval before the merger would take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.558" offset="3135007">Now --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="768.942" offset="3152562">There was a legislative change Mr. Justice to this extent that after the Philadelphia Bank case, Congress, in the 1966 Bank Merger Act, added the convenience and needs defunct.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.477" offset="3202612">But at the same time, at the same time, Congress indicated that it wished bank mergers to be tested under the standards that had adhibit to been applied under the antitrust laws under Section 7, and we think that what Congress did in the 1966 amendments was to say that you continue to evaluate competitive effect the same as it’s always been evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.457" offset="3306580">And I will mention in a minute, this Court has always stressed the structure of the market based on concentration ratios.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.397" offset="3334374">But then said, if it turns out that a merger has the prohibited anticompetitive effect, then and only then, it’s the court to consider whether this otherwise a illegal merger is saved.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="878.137" offset="3589329">And the question which is left open in Falstaff was the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.789" offset="3599882">But we do not concede that if the Court would reject that theory that we lose this case because we’ve indicated in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.852" offset="3624124">We do think there was evidence showing that this bank was to perceive the entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.859" offset="3640216">And we also have the other point which I’ll just mention, I’m alluded to previously that if this -- the effect of this merger by making Washington Trust a part of the National Bank of Commerce would be to eliminate whatever potential Washington Trust has as a large significant independent bank and the Spokane market of expanding beyond that area and perhaps combining.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.737" offset="3735719">Now, the reason we think that the question left open in the Falstaff case should be resolved in favor of the United States position is the whole intent of Congress when it amended Section 7 in 1950 to strengthen, and what Congress was concerned about was what it viewed as the rising increase in concentration in the American economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.523" offset="3842821">Congress recognized that more and more proportions of the economy were being brought under the control of a small number of large firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.611" offset="3879184">And Congress, when it strengthened the statute in 1950, was concern about the long-range prospects of the American economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.010" offset="3920771">It was not looking unlike the Sherman Act to the immediate effect whether a particular transaction restrain commerce; it was looking to the long-range effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.131" offset="3957238">It wanted to basically to channel business growth into procompetitive channels to stop the practices by which American business was gradually taking more, bringing more and more of the economy under control.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.591" offset="4031112">As this Court stated in the Philadelphia Bank case that one premise of Section 7 was that corporate growth by internal expansion is socially preferable to growth by acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.264" offset="4081789">Now, when a market becomes concentrated, what happens according to the economists is that the vigor of competition tends to diminish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.636" offset="4119301">You have a small number of firms in the market; you have accommodation, parallel practices begin to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.199" offset="4149499">And the only real hope, frequently, for even deconcentrating the market or shaking it up, so that there will be more competition in the market, is if someone new comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.704" offset="4203520">And someone new comes in, in a way that is going to force this new firm to compete vigorously by what, an antitrust jargon is called de novo entry, that is they come in anew either by themselves starting the branch of the business or alternatively by making a toehold acquisition, getting a small segment of the market which enables them to get into the market and from that base by vigorous competition growing and expanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.677" offset="4319504">But it is essential to stress that in that situation, you have a new firm, a new firm, coming in to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.412" offset="4354403">And when a firm that is on the outside and is a likely entrant by one of these two methods, comes in by applying a large share of the market, 22% in this case you’ve not only eliminated the potential for bringing some competition and hopefully eventual deconcentration into this market, but all you have done is substitute one for the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.489" offset="4446668">So, you’ve not only lost an additional competitor in this process, but you’ve eliminated the potential for improving the competitive situation in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.807" offset="4492016">Now, as I have indicated in my response to the Chief Justice, we think that these principles are equally applicable --</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.857" offset="4860134">We think if it all the claim that the new bank will be a more effective competitor in the market is what Congress intended to be studied under the convenience and needs defense, but that that is, we think is a relevant factor in determining the initial threshold question whether there has been anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.041" offset="4948950">And as we develop in our brief and I hope to get to, we think in this case that the so-called benefits, so-called benefits, which the District Court found this merger would bring to the City of Spokane, those benefits we do not think constitute the kind of benefits that Congress intended to recognize.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.428" offset="5142465">Initially, it may well be that a bank coming in substituting itself for a somewhat weaker back, may produce an immediate floury of competition, a little more competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.024" offset="5188859">But in the long run, in the long run we think, it’s anticompetitive because it stills a concentrated market and you’ve lost one of the significant potentials for deconcentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.675" offset="5235461">I may add in this case, this is not a case of the acquiring bank coming in because the acquired bank is weak or floundering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.612" offset="5275167">This is a successful, very prosperous, good bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.196" offset="5429499">The whole purpose of Section 7 is to try to stop the increases in concentration, to try stop these what Congress believed to be deleterious friends in the economy, and banking itself unfortunately tends to be concentrated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.429" offset="5606504">We think that’s the whole purpose that Congress had when it amended Section 7 in 1950 in order to strengthen it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.422" offset="6026449">One of the banks in Washington, the fifth largest bank, the Old National Bank, itself has assisted in the organization of five banks, which it subsequently acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.827" offset="6076082">And according to the deposition of a Mr. Witherspoon, who is the Chairman of the Board of the Old National Bank, they assisted and sponsored these banks and I would quote “with the hope and belief that we would be able to acquire them in the future and make branches of the Old National there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.882" offset="6156225">And that’s at page 608 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.326" offset="6166047">He also stated in his deposition that they had informed the comptroller of what they intended to do, the way he described it as the informer comptroller of their efforts to establish branches by this means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.137" offset="6221322">That’s at page 610.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.960" offset="6228637">And when he was asked to the comptroller object to this, he said on the contrary, in one instance it was the comptroller, that is, rather the assistance comptroller in the presence of the comptroller who suggested that they follow this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.063" offset="6280986">And in subsequently approving merges of banks in the State of Washington between the sponsoring bank and the sponsored bank the comptroller has recognized that the bank did play this role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.680" offset="6335425">Now, the acquiring bank in this case, the National Bank of Commerce, itself on one occasion sponsored a bank in the so-called Columbia Shopping Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.551" offset="6382968">Now, the claim is that they had no intention of ever acquiring it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.611" offset="6403239">Well, this record shows that from months on end, a number of important officials of the National Bank of Commerce were concerned with all the details of this bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.132" offset="6457260">They aided and they found help find the manager for the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.203" offset="6473561">On one occasion, the Board of Directors of the National Bank of Commerce personally selected a man who subsequently declined the post to be the president of this new bank, and, as they say, they say “Well, we hope to be able to acquire the bank”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.585" offset="6535105">And it seems to us in the light of this, it’s much more than they hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.787" offset="6551928">They obviously anticipated that they would be able to do that. On another occasion, there’s an internal memorandum in which, in 1971, the Director of Marketing Research for the National Bank of Commerce suggested to an Assistant Vice President of the bank that perhaps I might spoke the word he used was “sponsor” a bank in another smaller city in Oregon, Pullman and that’s shown in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.112" offset="8277159">Now, the reason that the District Court held on the defendant’s contend, this would not be a suitable candidate for acquisition is that under the ten-year limitation on State Law, and this, of course, is the state organized bank, this bank would not be available for acquisition until 1975.</text>

            <text syncTime="2206.255" offset="8901799">They’re going to compete as vigorously as possible and attempt to get into that market and to expend their share of the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.707" offset="8987585">What you have is you have the same basic structure inside the market and you don’t have the same kind of incentive to compete to be -- to bring and inject some new vigor into the market to possibly deconcentrate the market that you would have if they came in by acquiring a small bank, a bank with a very small share which would be the basis for growing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.992" offset="9112764">I think it’s important to find out is that the sort of thing they would likely to do, that they want to get in to Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.184" offset="9141499">How important was it to this bank to get into Spokane, so that if they were unable, if they were unable to get in by making this large acquisition, they do everything they could to get in by some on to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.375" offset="9186220">We think there is no question about that, that this is one of the things that the National Bank of Commerce has wanted to do for a long, long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.758" offset="9219762">To begin with, although the National Bank of Commerce is the second largest bank in the state, it’s the only one bank that is represented in only one of the four largest cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.785" offset="9267931">It is represented only in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.276" offset="9277858">It is not represented in Spokane, the second largest Tacoma or Everett, the next three largest cities in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.816" offset="9312026">The parties to this case stipulated that representation in Spokane has been a long sort goal of NBC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.504" offset="9342746">That’s at 367 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.171" offset="9353404">The Former President of the National Bank of Commerce who is now the President of Marine Bancorporation, which is the bank holding company that has all of the stock of the bank, stated that his bank has been interested in  getting into Spokane for a long, long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.123" offset="9413277">He said since prior to 1933, roughly more than 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.499" offset="9434697">He explained in the deposition that it was important for the National Bank of Spokane to get in there because all of the other major banks are represented there, and he said we feel there’s business available to us in Spokane if we are represented there, that’s at Page 139 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.522" offset="9502824">And similarly in the -- its 1970 report to stockholders, the holding company in commenting on this merger said that this finally brought the National Bank of Commerce “within sight of one of its long sort goals representation in the City of Spokane.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.085" offset="9577117">That’s at Page 1270 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.519" offset="9586834">And indeed in a brief filed with the comptroller in support of this merger, a so-called economic brief, discussing the economics of the area and probably the economics of the merger itself, what the bank said was and I quote again from Page 1743 that “If Commerce is to maintain its present relative position with its competitors and maintain the business of its major national customers, Commerce must have representation in Spokane.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.269" offset="9717864">“Must” was the words they used, not that they like to, not they thought it was so, they must have representation in Spokane.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.992" offset="10040738">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.033" offset="10056829">There has been a question about the desire of the National Bank of Commerce to get into the Spokane market, but if the question is whether or not they would be willing to go into any manner other than this one of this particular merger, there are four principle banking markets in the State of Washington: Seattle, Everett, Tacoma and Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.578" offset="10151079">At the present time, the National Bank of Commerce has all of its officers in the Seattle market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.199" offset="10173544">It does not have any representation in any of the other three markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.111" offset="10189218">But of course if they, at some acceptable means of entry, were to be developed, they would be very happy to go into that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.700" offset="10231536">Mr. Friedman referred to the trends and although there is no specific finding on the subject, the evidence in this case shows that there is no discernible trend in the State of Washington towards concentrating -- concentration of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.607" offset="10283154">As a matter of fact, the number of banks have increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.403" offset="10294335">In 1960, there were 87 banks; today, there are 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.184" offset="10313456">In 1960, there were 378 banking offices in Washington; today, there are 681.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.969" offset="10340624">If you want to look at the share of the market during the past 10 years, the share of the market which Commerce has picked up has increased from 18.9 in 1960 to 19.1 today, so that the share of the market is practically constant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.085" offset="10417110">So whether you look at the number of banks or you look at the number of branches or whether you look at the share of the market, there is no discernible trend in the State of Washington towards concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.041" offset="10460891">Now, justice is really asserting three ways in this merger in which it consummated lessen competition so as to violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.320" offset="10502060">First, they contend that but for this merger, these two banks will someday be in direct competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.276" offset="10529855">Of course, this can happen only in the event that the two banks get offices in the same market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.586" offset="10551066">Either Commerce will have to move into the Spokane market or spoke or the Washington Trust Bank is going to have to move out and into some market where Commerce is doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.497" offset="10598713">They make a second contention as to the violation of the act and that they argue that Commerce is now on the fringe of the market and exert some competitive influence on the competitors that are in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.751" offset="10667781">The argument upon which they lay the greatest stress is that -- but this merger, these two banks will become direct competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.885" offset="10700278">And if the merger is enjoined, Commerce will enter Spokane by establishing a branch of its bank de novo or what they call tantamount to de novo, that’s the sponsored bank procedure, or by foothold entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.933" offset="10756493">Now, the Court is asking questions with respect to foothold entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.296" offset="10781884">The Trial Court made a finding that there is no bank in Spokane today, which could serve as a foothold entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.137" offset="10809260">There are only two banks in the City of Spokane, which are smaller than Washington Trust Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.848" offset="10828173">One is the American Commercial Bank, the state bank to which Mr. Friedman alluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.378" offset="10862237">That bank was formed in 1965, but it has, in its charter, a prohibition against its merger or its sale or combination of any other bank for a period of ten years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.424" offset="11826469">And the Trial Court rejected all three of the arguments of Justice Department and assigned a factual basis for all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.528" offset="11862831">The Trial Court found that even the absence of these statutes the bank, the National Bank of Commerce would not go into Downtown Spokane if they had to go in by de novo entry or by the acquisition of a small toehold bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.435" offset="11974531">The Court found that it wouldn’t be compatible with prudent business practice in commercial banking for a major or full service bank such as Commerce to enter a major metropolitan area such as Spokane with a limited service bank or a small bank which would be compatible with the amount of deposits that they might reasonably expect to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.586" offset="12083096">As we’ve just mentioned if they did go in and they couldn’t branch and that branching in Washington is almost essential to affect the competition in the metropolitan areas, such as Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.132" offset="12125309">There happens to be a very good example in the City of Spokane of the imprudence of attempting to go in with a small branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.393" offset="12166269">The Pacific National Bank is a subsidiary of Western Bancorporation, the largest bank holding company within Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.138" offset="12213290">It’s the third largest bank in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.004" offset="12224784">Now, ten years ago in 1964 it did, in fact, go into the city of Spokane by toehold entry, by acquiring a small branch or a small bank which had two branches; one in downtown Spokane and one out on the Whitworth College campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.297" offset="12301897">Since that time in ten years, they have not been able to increase their share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.260" offset="12325825">But today, they are the smallest bank in Spokane measured by Spokane deposits and there is really no reason to believe that if Commerce attempted to go in by foothold that they could do any better than Pacific Nationals Bank has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.995" offset="12396774">The growth in Spokane during the last ten years has been slow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.306" offset="12409940">The lower court found that there has been some growth in the last ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.940" offset="12428539">I think the town has in fact lost 10,000 population and county has grown about 3%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.114" offset="12461244">Now this compares with other markets where Commerce isn’t now located such as Everett which is increased 10,000 during the period the Spokane has lost 10,000 and the county in which Everett is located has increased in population almost 35%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.644" offset="12523311">The City of Tacoma, which is another market in which Commerce isn’t -- doesn’t presently have offices has actually increased about 15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.853" offset="12564167">Now, the importance of this is simply that if Commerce did decide that they want to go into one of these other markets and wanted to spend their capital for that purpose, the chances are that they would go into Everett or Tacoma much sooner than they would go into Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.122" offset="12617247">And this was just another reason if the Court assigned as to his finding as to why it was not likely that Commerce would go into Spokane if they had to go in by de novo entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.891" offset="12676284">The Regional Administrator of National Banks in Washington took the stand and testified that in his opinion it was not likely that there would be any future charters for banks granted in Spokane in the reasonably foreseeable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.562" offset="12731037">He based this on the population growth of the city and such other factors as the comptroller considers in passing on new bank applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.663" offset="12791432">Now, as I said we have these factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.278" offset="12805851">What the Court really found was that there just wasn’t sufficient economic incentive to put Commerce into Spokane if they had to go in on a de novo basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.916" offset="12840438">And of course in addition to that, we have the statutory barriers that Mr. Friedman alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.471" offset="12874606">The statute which prohibits branching in Washington is found in Remington’s Code of Washington, 30.40.029.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.928" offset="12936464">It’s reproduced at Pages 4 and 5 of our Brief, and I would like to call the Court’s particular attention to the last paragraph of the statute which appears on Page 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.938" offset="12992470">Now, this statute provides, this is plainly as it can provide insofar as it’s pertinent to this case that Commerce cannot go into Spokane with a de novo branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.488" offset="13050671">Justice argues that the statute maybe evaded or circumvented an entry tantamount, a de novo entry maybe achieved by their so-called sponsored bank procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.891" offset="13104274">I’d also like to tell the Court this that this word “sponsor” has been a very misleading word in this case, because practically, all new banks in Washington are sponsored in one way or another when they are formed, and the comptroller, of course, encourages this because it’s been official, both to the sponsoring bank as well as to the sponsored bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.537" offset="13198942">But that does not mean that they have control over the bank or that they can branch when they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.594" offset="13219109">For example, Commerce which has 107 branches, testified that they don’t have one single branch that was ever sponsored bank, I mean the bank that they sponsored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.337" offset="13266129">It’s true that they assist these banks in various ways, but Columbia Center was brought up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.640" offset="13303327">There is both the Chairman of Columbia Center testified that they’re not obligated to sell their bank to Commerce at any time either the assets of the bank or the stock, and the officers of Marine Bancorporation testified that they have no agreement either oral or written to acquire the bank at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.359" offset="13406145">Now it’s true that they --</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.945" offset="13840509">Now it’s true that in that bank, in that particular case, in order to bring banking service into the community, Commerce did, I would say, sponsor a bank in the sense that they went out and help them get management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.572" offset="13891082">They furnish them with about three directors out of seven, but the important thing to me is the purpose for which this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.509" offset="13942805">This is not a case for Commerce deciding they wanted to get into bank and sent out people or stockholders to organize a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.333" offset="13986064">What really happened was that the business people of the city applied for a bank and they were turned down by the Regional Administrator for the reason that they did not have anyone in the organization that had any particular knowledge of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.791" offset="14043951">And so, they came to the National Bank of Commerce and sought that assistance and they obtained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.901" offset="14064327">But here again as I say that that doesn’t give Commerce any assurance that they are ever going to acquire that bank, and the only thing that’s important with respect to this procedure is whether or not it affords to Commerce some method of getting into the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.568" offset="14127020">What we are talking about here is means of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.875" offset="14136216">We contend we don’t have any means of entry in the Spokane that regard by our statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.891" offset="14160353">They come back and say we can get into Spokane and they can get in this particular manner, which they call the sponsored bank method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.478" offset="14194625">And we deny that and what I’m saying that so far as Columbia Center is concerned that that does not afford to us in means of entry into Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.425" offset="14234436">Now, let me mention these five branches with Mr. Whiterspoon contented that the Old National Bank picked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.277" offset="14269858">They apparently did, on two occasions, they actually sent someone out to attempt to organize the bank and obviously, or Mr. Whiterspoon said, for the purpose of actually acquiring the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.946" offset="14308519">Now, the record here isn’t entirely clear as to this is what they did, but what I contend is that it really doesn’t make much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.889" offset="14356271">One of these arrangements was made in 1959, two of them were made in 1962, and two of them made in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.564" offset="14395037">And since that time, so far as this record shows, there hasn’t been any such acquisitions or any such means of entry by any other bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.389" offset="14478315">Well, my co-counsel here has given me a note to make it clear that Columbia Center is not in Spokane, but I think I answered that question that it’s down in Central Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="3611.198" offset="14521574">It’s down in Kennewick or in the Richmond area which is near the Columbia River area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.746" offset="14559713">Now, as I’ve said that this statute which prevents us form branching in Washington as one statute, which we are concerned with, there is a second statute, the Holding Company Statute, which prohibits any bank holding company in Washington from owning or controlling more than 25% of the capital stock of another bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.575" offset="14643096">Now, I point that out to show that we are not only stopped from branching, but we are only stopped from holding company expansion, because the holding company can’t possibly own more than 25% of the stock of the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.167" offset="14697430">And of course, you cannot control either the seller of the bank or the purchaser of the bank if you only have a 25% control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.356" offset="14730136">In Washington, you have to have 67% of the stock of the bank; you have to have a consent of 67% of the shareholders before you can sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.638" offset="14767334">So that on this withholding company, this holding company statute, we have new -- we don’t have the power or the authority to expand in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.916" offset="14812369">The penalty provided in the statute is forfeiture of the holding company charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.306" offset="14837969">So, no prudent person is going to attempt to expand in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.664" offset="14891363">Now with respect to this so-called Wings Theory, justice is also contending that Commerce, by reason of its positions of the Wings, exerts a beneficial pro-competitive influence on the competitors in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.297" offset="14957923">Justice concedes on Page 27 of their brief that this was not the primary basis upon which they tried the case, but it is in the pleadings and always mentioned by two or three witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.529" offset="15010900">But I like to point out that in this respect, all they showed was the proximity to the market and there is utterly no evidence in the record to show that they had any effect upon the competitors in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.269" offset="15061786">So that the mere physical proximity, of course, without any showing of, in effect, on a better consumer market, doesn’t show or can’t develop into any blasting of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.693" offset="15135556">There were four witnesses for the bank, two bank officers and two economists who testified that Commerce, prior to the announcement of the merger, exerted no influence at all on the Spokane market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.820" offset="15200026">With respect to the Washington State Bank moving out into other areas, I just want to point out that justice did not try the crew what banking markets or what sections they might move out into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.675" offset="15255406">They simply argue that the bank has the capability of expanding and, therefore, its elimination would be a lessening the competition under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.254" offset="15301799">Now, in conclusion, I would want to point out that both parties in the case are urging what they considered to be pro-competitive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.725" offset="15335654">What the Justice Department’s case really boils down to simply that they’re saying that it’s pro-competitive to save Commerce for some future entrant into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.971" offset="15372643">We contend that if we move into the market right now, a bigger bank, a much stronger bank that that is also pro-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.603" offset="15411200">It’s -- the Trial Court found that the Spokane Banking market actually needs another competitor of the size of Seattle First.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.305" offset="15445995">And what I think that the real issue for this Court is to which is the more pro-competitive, is it to say this to the bank that they might enter the Spokane market ten years from now, and then maybe spend another ten years in attempting to build their deposits to a point where they can actually compete or wouldn’t it be more pro-competitive for them to go in immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="3980.960" offset="16000627">First, the plaintiff’s argument is basically circular in question begging, because it assumes that Section 7 requires the banking agencies to permit de novo entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.087" offset="16041064">Second, Section 7 does not supersede the federal banking statutes as plaintiff somewhat explicitly and certainly implicitly contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.650" offset="16075337">Third, potential competition does not have the same application to banking as to one regulated industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.838" offset="16100101">Fourth, the plaintiff’s sponsorship scheme does not only illegal dubious means of -- legally dubious means of circumventing state law, but is actually anticompetitive in its effect, as I shall demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.516" offset="16146808">Five, Section 7 does not forbid a merger, which lessens potential competition, but it increases actual competition in the relevant market, which is somewhat different in the question left open in Falstaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.099" offset="16193097">And finally, the plaintiff would rewrite Section 7 so that potentiality attenuates substantiality to triviality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.209" offset="16225593">Now first, the plaintiff’s argument is basically circular in question begging, because although plaintiff has the burden of proving the violation of Section 7, not depends upon proving that the merger would probably lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.515" offset="16274808">Plaintiff admits there is no actual competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.510" offset="16282749">Therefore, the theory of plaintiff entirely is that absent a merger, the acquiring bank here would enter the market de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.667" offset="16323396">This however requires the permission of the banking authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.229" offset="16337711">There is objective evidence that this permission would not be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.178" offset="16353489">Plaintiff attempts to surmount this barrier by assuming that administrative permission is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.212" offset="16377626">Thus, in the brief in this case at Page 51, plaintiff says, “It must be assumed that the regulatory decision will reflect the national policy in favor of market extensions by internal expansion rather than not by acquisition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.593" offset="16431125">There is a similar statement in plaintiff’s Connecticut brief at Page 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.609" offset="16447216">Thus, plaintiff’s entire argument is based upon the assumption that Section 7 requires the permission of the administrative authorities for de novo entry and once you eliminate that assumption, plaintiff does not have an argument on potential competition, but that assumption is the very matter to be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.850" offset="16512104">It’s the very question and issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.188" offset="16521509">Therefore, it’s an entirely circular and question of begging argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.069" offset="16536973">Second, plaintiff in effect asserts that Section 7 supersede the federal banking statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.578" offset="16563096">Plaintiff clearly argues that in a bank merger case involving potential competition that Section 7 standards must be applied at Page 52 of the brief in this case, plaintiff asserts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4515.956" offset="18140578">However, in banking if one of those standing on the fringes wants to enter the market, he must make application to an administrative agency without exceptions state or national and the banks in the market have an opportunity to go in and to be heard and to oppose the entry of the new entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.984" offset="18204735">Consequently, there is no unperceived entry; there is no unperceived potential entrant in banking as there may be in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.338" offset="18246113">Furthermore, the determination of the propriety of the organization of a new bank and its entry into the market, this Court has said is specifically a matter for determination by the banking agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.601" offset="18299193">And therefore, I submit, it is not appropriate for determination in the case such as the present one and what the National Bank versus New Orleans case which is a very complicated case explained at Page 55 of the Marine Bank brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.158" offset="18357394">Basically in order to avoid the restrictions of state laws to branching, to form the bank holding company as the department would have the defendant banks do hear and it organize a new bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.504" offset="18406713">There was a litigation below, which resulted in an injunction against the bank charter being issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.094" offset="18433149">When the case came to this Court, this Court held that the lower courts have no jurisdiction to pass upon that question and remanded the matter to the federal reserve or the banking agency in that case saying, we have concluded that District Court that it is the exclusive function of the Federal Reserve Board to act in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.367" offset="18506188">In cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for regulating subject matter should not be passed over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.777" offset="18559896">Therefore, we submit that this Court should not, by and grafting the potential competition theory of the Section 7 and then applying that to banking, pass over the expertise of the banking agencies as to who and when there should be entry into the banking field, which is what potential competition means, potential entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.713" offset="18647562">Now let me say a word about the sponsorship scheme proposed by the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.377" offset="18666266">It is true as my colleague Mr. Moen has said that there is a good deal of ambiguity about the use of this term sponsorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.460" offset="18694583">In fact, there is evidence that banking executives like others in other businesses, sometimes help new institutions that they give advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.332" offset="18746096">Old lawyers do this to young lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.985" offset="18752679">This is not an unknown procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.722" offset="18759680">However, sponsorship as used in this case by the Department of Justice means and I think must mean if it is to have significance that contribution of capital and the holding of some sort of a significant legal entrance in the bank, but it doesn’t mean that it means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.363" offset="18818194">Anybody can go and get fringe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.057" offset="18824986">I suppose I could go down and ask my friendly banker how I go about organizing a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.551" offset="18842958">However, in the first place this method, if approved by this Court, would be available only to national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.167" offset="18869394">There is no contention that Mr. Friedman has conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.395" offset="18878380">It wouldn’t be available state banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.540" offset="18886949">This immediately would destroy the competitive equality between national and state banks which Congress clearly intended, as this Court has often said in cases cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.791" offset="18923938">Second place, this would undermine the dual banking system and handicap the state banks by giving the federal banks a technique not available to state banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.811" offset="18959987">2/3 of all the commercial banks in the country today are state banks, only1/3 are national.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.946" offset="18980571">They happen to be the larger banks but this would give the advantage to the national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.874" offset="19000216">Further, at best, this scheme is expensive, difficult, and risky unless available not only -- not to all banks but only to the larger banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.413" offset="19030413">It is clear from the records here that the cost of forming a holding company and organizing a bank is upwards of $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.460" offset="19058625">The statutory minimum is a-million-and-a-half dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.579" offset="19071060">However, of all the commercial banks in the United States, 25% are under 5 million in deposits; 48% under 10 million; and 78% under 25 million, both state and federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.292" offset="19117871">And I submit that as a practical matter, this is a method that would be available really only to the top 5% of the banks in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.417" offset="19154442">Furthermore, this scheme would endanger new and small banks by offering and threatening undue competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.780" offset="19187879">This appears in the record in the present case at Page 1034.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.715" offset="19203657">The Court asked the Department of Justice counsel and I quote, “Your theory is that if a new bank went in there, Spokane, they would take some deposits from the other banks and therefore the other banks wouldn’t make as much money and therefore would increase competition, is that your theory?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.663" offset="19263425">And the department counsel said “Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.320" offset="19273979">In other words, new and small banks are likely to be the victim of this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.340" offset="19294145">These are the ones that are owned and by small business and by the minority groups that are struggling for recognition today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.978" offset="19316611">These are the ones that are protected by the bank regulatory agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.498" offset="19330717">Under plaintiff’s theory there would be no protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.675" offset="19343464">Consequently, if the plaintiff’s sponsorship scheme were approved by this Court, this would insure growth by the largest banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.350" offset="19374184">It would insure the foreclosure of markets to small and medium size banks and it would probably lead to the failure of small banks and thus ultimately to the much greater concentration of banking business in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.558" offset="19426952">Now fifth, Section 7 does not forbid a merger, which lessens potential competition but increases actual competition in the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.840" offset="19460075">I trust I need not point out that the Court did in Falstaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.005" offset="19472718">That the Courts opinion said that the question left open was whether a new entry that neither help nor hurt competition was illegal merely because the acquiring company could but did not entered de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.639" offset="19535308">That question is not reached here because in both cases, there is evidence that here the entry will make the market more competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.035" offset="19568849">The Court found in this case, this merger will make the Spokane market even more competitive as it will replace a bank with a limited competitive ability with one with greater capacity to provide loans and it will remove its competitive disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.138" offset="19633319">Now, plaintiff, in effect, answers this by saying that to the extent the Court relied on the theory the merger would replace Washington Trust with the bank able to compete more effectively that these are factors to be considered on the community needs and convenience defense and not in asserting the competitive impact of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.600" offset="19707193">If I may be disrespectful, I say nonsense, to say that an increase in competition cannot be considered in appraising the competitive impact simply doesn’t make sense under the antitrust laws or under any other laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.428" offset="19762469">In fact, Justice Marshall in concurring in Falstaff said that if a company would have remained outside the market but to the possibility of entry by acquisition and if it is exerting no influence as a perceived potential entrant, then there will normally be no competitive loss when it enters by acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.469" offset="19830596">Indeed, there may even be a competitive gain to the extent that it strengthens the market position of the acquired firm, which is exactly the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.247" offset="19869780">Furthermore, in Brown Shoe, this Court said, Congress recognized the stimulation to competition that might flow from particular mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.546" offset="19902903">When concerned as to the act’s breadth was expressed supporters the amendment indicated, it would not impede, for example, a merger between two small companies to enable the competition to compete more effectively with larger corporations dominating the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.326" offset="19962044">Here admittedly, there is no change in market structure or concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.854" offset="19976150">There is only a strengthening of one competitor, which has already stimulated new competition in Spokane as we point out at Page 53 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.708" offset="20007602">And this does not lessen competition but increases competition which is the purpose of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.945" offset="20032575">Finally, let me come to my last point, last former point and then I will now or later answer some points of the department that the plaintiff would rewrite Section 7 so that potentiality really reduces substantiality to triviality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.416" offset="20086387">There has been some talk as to what potentiality means, and Mr. Friedman has candidly said, they’re looking at very long range effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.777" offset="20123899">As a matter of fact, this was confirmed by a speech by the acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General the Antitrust Division made the day after we filed our brief and published an ATRR April 16, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.692" offset="20171546">It is number 699 at Pages (d) 1 to 5 in which he said the departments concern for preserving competition is premised upon the belief that existing market structures are not immutable over time. Changes in law, technology, business philosophy and imperatives of the market place may result in future market entry with attended increased competition in a manner, which would not have been predicted at an earlier time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.445" offset="20278544">The department’s efforts, he candidly states, are aimed that these market extension cases, which involves theories of potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.415" offset="20306442">Now I submit that to say that potential competition, which the Department of Justice is now protecting, is the possibility of future market entry in some presently unpredictable or unforeseeable manner, is to say that we are dealing with something that is improbable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.557" offset="20371017">The law simply cannot deal with the unpredictable or the unforeseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.552" offset="20387004">The essence of legal probability is foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.176" offset="20405499">Thus, plaintiff is seeking to have the standard of proof in Section 7 cases, reduced from probability and substantiality to possibility and triviality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.061" offset="20448967">Plaintiff asked the Court to forbid any merger, which might foreclose any unforeseeable future possibility of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.573" offset="20483030">But this is impossible to do because the unforeseeable we simply cannot deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.548" offset="20502988">This is unreasonable, unworkable, unprecedented, and I submit a formula for stagnation not competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.824" offset="20532036">Furthermore, in my brief I have submitted to the Court that I believe that this standard, if it becomes established in the law, is a formula that will threaten civil liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.806" offset="20567980">The brief was filed April 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.107" offset="20581146">I suggested that the potential enemies in authoritarian countries are prosecuted as the department would go after potential competitors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.021" offset="20620852">On April 15, the week after we filed our brief, the Washington Star News published a little item saying that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the well known Russian author, had been exiled because, it was said by a leading Russian spokesman, as he was guilty of making “potentially dangerous proposals”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.615" offset="20711236">They said that he was accused of writing Utopian and potentially dangerous ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.512" offset="20734746">Now this is the language of authoritarianism.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.180" offset="20745509">This is the doctrine which the Department of Justice would have this Court accept in which I submit if accepted in these cases cannot be confined of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.077" offset="20785006">If we -- if potentiality in the sense of unforeseeability, unpredictability that which cannot be really met by present proof, cannot be dealt with on the basis of the contemporary record, then there are simply no standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.716" offset="20839654">There is no way that we can deal with the data presented with the evidence if the Court is going to permit this kind of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.106" offset="20897123">My time is up.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="5210.754" offset="20919798">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.295" offset="20933904">There has been some reference by Mr. Moen to the testimony of the President of the Columbia Bank, the bank that was sponsored in, and we referred to the Columbia bank not that that’s a way of getting into Spokane, but to show, to show that this is a method by which banks do enter markets where they are not permitted directly to branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.104" offset="21021153">I would like to invite the Court’s attention to two documents in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.725" offset="21039647">The first is at Page 1514 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.472" offset="21054589">It’s a letter from Mr. Buck, who was the Senior Vice President of the National Bank of Commerce to a Mr. Looney.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.285" offset="21085936">Mr. Looney was an attorney in the area where the Columbia Bank was being formed who became -- he had done some work for the branch of the National Bank of Commerce in this area and he ultimately became the Chairman of the Board of the new bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.405" offset="21146331">So, he was the man who was intimately concerned in the formation of the bank and understanding what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.202" offset="21169528">Now, two paragraphs I’d like to refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.655" offset="21183321">The first is in the middle of that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.389" offset="21190322">At 1514 he said that there’s been no --Mr. Bulk said, there has been no written or oral agreement or understanding with respect to acquisition of the proposed bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.235" offset="21237656">On advice of counsel, we have been extremely perhaps excessively cautious to avoid this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.054" offset="21260957">It is true nevertheless that our bank has inspired submission of the application and is hopeful that in appropriate future time, it will possible to acquire the bank for incorporation within its present system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.395" offset="21314351">At the bottom of the page, I pointed out that the way the bank was being arranged, the majority stock will be in hands friendly to the National Bank of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.450" offset="21350504">In order to insure as much as possible its future as a branch of that bank, it avoids certain legal problems, which could arise if we were to agree or contract with respect to its acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.693" offset="21403481">Then at Page 1573 is a letter from Mr. Looney back to Mr. Buck written a few months later and these letters were all contemporaneously written at the time the Columbia Bank was being organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.395" offset="21462309">And what Mr. Looney said to Mr. Buck at the bottom of page 1513 is “We need a clear definition in understanding of the management responsibilities as between the directors of the unit bank and the management of the National Bank of Commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.448" offset="21530540">That’s between the bank that was sponsoring and the bank that was sponsored.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.283" offset="21545900">For example, many of the steps taken initially will have a barring on the long range operation of the bank many years after it has changed from a unit bank to a branch bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.887" offset="21604310">Now, this seems to us to indicate very clearly that the whole purpose of this arrangement was ultimately to permit the National Bank of Commerce to acquire it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.051" offset="21640986">Now Mr. Loevinger has suggested that because the authorization of the regulatory authorities is needed before a bank can enter the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.267" offset="21693858">If the regulatory authorities suggest, they would not charter a new bank, that’s kind of the end of a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.200" offset="21721548">Well, to begin with, I just point out that that argument of course has no application to the possibility of entry by making a foothold acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.039" offset="21748924">But more fundamentally, it seems to us this is basically not the scheme of Section 7, this is not what Congress did not intend to give the Comptroller of the Currency the authority to veto, the authority to veto that the enforcement of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.546" offset="21830949">When the Comptroller says that he does not think it’s likely that he would charter a new bank, to begin with of course, his testimony is given in defense of a merger that he is already approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.369" offset="21882253">But more importantly, of course, the regional comptroller only makes a recommendation, but a regional official may think today he is not going to charter tomorrow or next week changes may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.873" offset="21932199">And we do believe that in this situation, the Comptroller’s view that he would not permit a new bank to be charted cannot be this positive on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.014" offset="21972846">Thank you.</text>
