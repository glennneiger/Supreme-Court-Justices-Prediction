            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Cheavens</label>
            <text syncTime="16.071" offset="141061">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.348" offset="146181">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.149" offset="161332">Yesterday, when the argument was interrupted, we were discussing the specific District Court findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.603" offset="195187">It will be recalled that the District Court found that the vessel was on sea, and vessel owner negligent in three respects: in failing to secure the cargo in Mobile, in failing to dunnage off the cargo in Mobile, and because of the presence of the piece of the paper covering the crack which was the immediate cause of the plaintiff's injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.278" offset="289855">The District Court also found that Cooper was negligent in two respects with respect to the failure to secure and with respect to the failure to dunnage off in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.984" offset="340637">Now, the precise legal significance of these findings has to be rather carefully scrutinized.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.528" offset="378880">First of all, it's to be noted that there is no finding of joint liability of the ship and Cooper to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.867" offset="424229">There is no finding of joint liability because the plaintiff, if it will be recalled, did not sue Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.419" offset="462472">Now, the significance of this is that since the plaintiff did not sue Cooper, there is thus no and I am quoting here from respondent's brief, “No common liability for concurrent fault” which is,' and again I am to use the words of the respondent's brief at page 25 which is the 'sine qua non of contribution'.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.886" offset="560274">That is, there is no joint liability because the plaintiff didn't sue Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.317" offset="594024">The second significance of the District Court's findings is that Cooper negligence was found to be negligence vis-à-vis the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.550" offset="642926">That is the acts which Cooper did.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.689" offset="655464">The failing to secure and the failing to done a job were found on a careful examination of the District Court's findings at a 163 and 164 of the appendix are found to be negligence because of -- this created a risk of harm to the plaintiff and subsequent longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.949" offset="736549">But these findings are legally immaterial because again the plaintiff for tactical considerations did not sue Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.185" offset="777509">The third legal significance to these findings is that under these findings and under the undisputed fact, there is not found to be any breach of duty by Cooper to the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.535" offset="842919">Because the two things Cooper was faulted for, failing to secure and failing to dunnage as between the ship and Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.767" offset="875833">The ultimate decision there was made by the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.528" offset="890880">It was the ship that decided whether or not to dunnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.851" offset="904150">If the ship wanted it dunnaged, the evidence shows Cooper would have dunnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.818" offset="920033">If the ship wanted the cargo secure, Cooper would have been happy to secure the cargo for of course an additional price.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.355" offset="946155">But those decisions were decisions of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.528" offset="966844">Thus, regardless of this Court's treatment of the more general problem before the Court, namely the right of contribution between joint tortfeasors in admiralty, there are two very specific reasons in this specific case, why this is an improper case for contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.782" offset="1047928">First of all, because as we have seen that the party which has been granted contribution, the Vessel has already been fully indemnified.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.704" offset="1087530">It was fully indemnified by Mid-Gulf Stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.156" offset="1113339">So that if we view the case as one where it is the Vessel which is suing Cooper for contribution, the Vessel's cause of action is extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.133" offset="1161300">The Court might feel but why it isn't the real party at interest here Mid-Gulf, because Mid-Gulf has stepped into the shoes of the Vessel and it has taken over the Vessel's defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.722" offset="1207589">But if that's the situation, then contribution is doubly unfair because if the plaintiff -- let us change this situations like, had the plaintiff sued Cooper alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.095" offset="1265162">Let's assume for instance the ship was not -- could not get jurisdiction over the ship but the vessel owner was in souvenir something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.119" offset="1297241">So, the plaintiff sues only Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.596" offset="1307167">Cooper even under the rule urged by the respondent would not be able to get contribution from Mid-Gulf because Mid-Gulf is statutorily immune from direct action by the plaintiff.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="320.411" stopTime="328.092">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="320.411" offset="1358367">But if Mid-Gulf indemnified the ship, it would it indemnify only for its actual lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.092" offset="1389087">Its actual loss is measured by the liability of the Vessel to the plaintiff which is the amount of the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.492" offset="1418762">Isn't indemnity for out of pocket loss and if the ship doesn't -- ultimately is liable for only half let's say, it's only out of pocket for half the liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="760.889" offset="3120274">First and I submit that the existing rule is that the law draws a distinction between collision cases on the one hand and non-collision cases on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.472" offset="3166668">In collision cases, there is a right of contribution, in non-collision cases, there is no right of contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.392" offset="3194358">This is what the Halcyon decision says.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.932" offset="3204493">This was expressly reaffirmed by the Court two years ago in the Atlantic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.068" offset="3229048">That's the current law.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.162" offset="3241378">The law is urged by the respondents is the opposite into the spectrum as embodied by the Fifth Circuit decision in this case and in its earlier decision in Watz against Zapata which is that there is a right of contribution, except generally, except where the party against whom contribution is sought is statutorily immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.116" offset="3341166">I would suggest that there may well be middle grounds between these two polar positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.196" offset="3373558">The middle grounds being that a right of contribution could be granted in all instances saved where the parties, the relationship was governed by the Ryan indemnity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.920" offset="3424444">Alternatively, a right of contribution could be granted either in all non-personal injury cases or in all non-harbor workers compensation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.587" offset="3479092">If I have time, I would like to discuss possible rationales for those approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.021" offset="3500826">The first approach, that is the existing law, the Halcyon Atlantic Approach may appear at first blush to be artificial why a distinction between collision and non-collision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.652" offset="3559340">The distinction is a sound one and that is that collision cases which are perhaps the oldest form of maritime litigation had well developed rules governing these situations long in advance of any legislative activity in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.095" offset="3633110">These rules even predate the 19th century activity of this Court in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.215" offset="3661636">On the other hand, in non-collision cases as Justice Black's opinion points out so clearly in the Halcyon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.761" offset="3691833">There is substantial legislative activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.258" offset="3709806">That legislative -- this is most pervasive in personal injury is somewhat less pervasive elsewhere but is notable for instance in cargo damage cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.074" offset="3753064">But all legislative activity in the field has always stop short of creating a right of contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.005" offset="3784725">Traditionally, contribution can only be created by the legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.792" offset="3807922">Indeed, in the states which have adopted contribution, it has almost been invariably done by legislation as opposed to judicial enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.343" offset="3970090">In most recently, of course, the rules were substantially changed in 1972 Amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.958" offset="5316545">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.374" offset="5334204">First, I want to address myself to the confusion that Mr. Cheavens has created about this full indemnity point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.590" offset="5383105">First of all, after the plaintiff sued Steamship Company, the Steamship Company sued the Houston Stevedores Mid-Gulf Stevedoring Company on the Ryan theory of indemnity and they also sued Cooper Stevedoring Company and Mobile on a similar type case but for two separate breaches of what the ship felt like was a breach of the implied Ryan warranty running to the Vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.896" offset="5484356">One, the negligence in the way the vessel was loaded and Mobile which is an entirely separate cause of action that the ship had against the Mobile Stevedore and they also had a separate cause of action against the Houston Stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.754" offset="5543811">My firm represented the Houston Mid-Gulf Stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.072" offset="5557081">Prior to trial, we negotiated out of settlement with our differences with the Vessel and as part of the settlement agreement of that cause of action, we assume that the defense of the Vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.063" offset="5596996">There has been nothing in the evidence ever about what the real exact terms of the settlement were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.833" offset="5620088">The first time this ever came up, Cooper filed no cross actions against us although they were free to do so, they're not statutorily immune or we're not statutorily immune from being sued by another Stevedoring and this has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.205" offset="5673587">But they didn't sue us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.886" offset="5684245">During the trial, Mr. Harm, one of trial attorney for Cooper put me on a stand quite by a surprise and asked me about the terms of the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.848" offset="5720189">Well, I didn't even make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.274" offset="5729802">The attorney that was handling the case before I got it is one that worked out the settlement with the ship and I just went in to trial the case and I am handling it since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.170" offset="5761463">But at that time I didn't know exactly what term where I had general idea, but the part of the terms of the agreement were that we would indemnify -- we took over the defense of the Vessel as the Vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.020" offset="5808797">So, we stepped in the shoes of the Vessel and then dismissed ourselves out of this case and proceeded on and just the plaintiff against the ship, against the Mobile Stevedore and that's the way the case has come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.192" offset="5853518">And legal issues involved should be determined on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.100" offset="5873162">This can be a very important case and I think Mr. Cheavens has done a good job to kind of confuse the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.172" offset="6917433">Well, the way we handled that judge is normally, in this type of situation, if we get full indemnity we usually agree on the attorney's fees between the parties and then if we can agree we go back to District Court and he awards it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.692" offset="6975530">But we usually work these things out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.607" offset="6991203">The case is up here, and Mr. Cheavens has asked you to, I think, take a limited approach the way you decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.799" offset="7039896">As I see it, the Court can take a limited view and that they can affirm the case just and say there is contribution in this fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.554" offset="7098932">But this leaves, I think as Mr. Cheavens pointed out some conflicts, that's going to cause them trouble in some of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.933" offset="7132473">You could reverse this case and just hold that under house, there will be no contribution in any non-maritime situation, non-collision maritime situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.370" offset="7178240">I think this is will be a horrible thing to do because as for reason, I will get into, I think it would make the law a lot more confused and a lot more arbitrary than it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.484" offset="7226723">Now, you can take a third solution to the case and I think that kind of leave the law exactly like it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.696" offset="7259533">You can decide, then on the fact-findings that I was entitled to full indemnity and just under Ryan, give me full indemnity, but that would not change the law and leave it exactly where it is today and I don't think the Court granted a writ in this case to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.942" offset="7324526">Now, I am going to suggest a rather bold sweeping approach that the Court can clear up this whole area for generations to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.746" offset="7371755">If you look at the case from a broad standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.387" offset="7386279">Now, before I get -- what I want to suggest, I would like to review historically the law in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.635" offset="7435285">In 1946, this Court passed a Sieracki opinion which in effect granted the right of a doctrine of unseaworthiness to cover longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.240" offset="7477708">A longshoreman could sue vessels for an unseaworthy condition which mounts to almost absolute liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.071" offset="7513025">As a result, after the Sieracki opinion, the longshoreman around the country started suing the vessel owners and recovering substantial amounts of money and it was beginning to get out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.486" offset="7558687">And in 1952, the Steamship Company and Halcyon on the case sued the Stevedores that caused unseaworthy condition to try to get some relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.733" offset="7599647">They felt it was kind of unjust that Stevedores could go on board, create an unseaworthy condition and then the Steamship Company had to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.373" offset="7630263">So, the Court took the case on review but because of the statutory immunity of the Stevedore denied the rights of the ship to collect contribution in the Halcyon on the case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1899.673" offset="7675402">Of course they did not see in so many words, they were denying it because the statutory immunity, did they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_dixie_smith" startTime="1905.076" stopTime="2073.828">
            <label>Mr. Bruce Dixie Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="1905.076" offset="7697032">Well, it's in the opinion that Section 5 of the Act and then you kind of -- there is a lot of dictum in the case so that is why, I think there is so much trouble as to what Halcyon really means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.798" offset="7743948">But anyway, they didn't let -- the ship have contribution against Stevedore and then things really got in to high gear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.813" offset="7771951">Until 1956 when the Court handed down Ryan, did not address itself to the contribution issue but came out with this warranty workmanlike service theory to grant full indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.579" offset="7843109">So, where the man's employer, the Stevedore employer breached this, here before unknown warranty and in somehow was contractual theory in the negligence lawsuit, then it got to be a 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.965" offset="7904653">One, the ship either had to pay a 100% of the Stevedore debt and this is a way it's going since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.783" offset="7931925">In Yiatchos 1963, you extended it even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.856" offset="7956167">Then in 1964, you backed off a little bit with the Italia decision, that the ship was guilty of such conduct sufficient to preclude then the Stevedore wouldn't have to pay 100% even if it breaks its warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.270" offset="8017816">But here again, both ways, because of the Ryan case which in effect respondent came about because of the Sieracki opinion, you have got two parties as many times equally at fault or both at fault having one of them having to pay all of the money and it's inequitable and it has been criticized by many Court, by many scholar and it got so bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.565" offset="8114991">And in 1972, Congress drastically amended the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.488" offset="8150727">One of the things they did was that they took away the longshoreman's right to sue the ship for unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.861" offset="8180193">This in effect overrules the Sieracki opinion that came down in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.437" offset="8206524">Number two, they said that Section 5 of the Act means what it says that Steamship Company can't sue the employer either for implied warranty or expressed warranty that even if they contract that they consume, they can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.632" offset="8271308">This in effect overrules Ryan as it applies to the injured man's employer which was what Ryan came out at that particular fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.905" offset="8320418">So, Amendments to the 1972 Act affectively reversed two prior leading cases that they have caused all these, that is, Sieracki and Ryan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.985" offset="8556669">Congress has done so drastically where a situation applies most of the time anyway between the employer, the injured longshoreman and the ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.550" offset="12538984">I would like to make just a few brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.709" offset="12555598">First, the merits of the contribution rule are at best arguable and they are certainly appropriate for legislation not for judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.205" offset="12609620">This is the common law tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.856" offset="12624144">They are legislative because they vitally effect amongst others the rights of injured plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.501" offset="12658730">If there is one category of people Mr. Justice Stewart who cannot be adjusted, whose rights cannot be adjusted by insurance, it is the plaintiff (Voice Overlap) plaintiff and as professor James points out, a rule of contributions severely restricts the plaintiff's rights about one-third of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.784" offset="12743889">Well, first, the states are closely divided on the merits of legislation and I refer Your Honors, to the Yale Law Review article which analyses the different state rule.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3177.333" offset="12786103">You mean on the merits of contribution?</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.453" offset="12790596">On the merits of contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.084" offset="12797074">Only a bare majority, even half contribution.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3182.790" offset="12807941">In the ordinary common law, in your common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.700" offset="12811598">That's right, of those and that is viewed all by legislation and of those nearly one-third of those do so only where the plaintiff has as a matter of tactics chosen to sue and has obtained a finding against both defendants, that has not occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.880" offset="12888294">So this Court would be doubly asked to create a rule which would work against injured plaintiffs in an area of the law where this Court has been especially solicitous of the rights of injured plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.645" offset="12951301">The rules of contribution in the states also frequently do not equally apportion but do so in a comparative thought basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.677" offset="12999471">A separate matter is that the issue of Ryan indemnity in this case is not before this Court, the Fifth Circuit denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.404" offset="13046387">Ryan indemnity had no cross petition for certiorari.</text>
