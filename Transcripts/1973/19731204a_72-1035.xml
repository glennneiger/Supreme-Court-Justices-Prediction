            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="71.218" offset="361639">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.769" offset="371775">This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.936" offset="396539">What is involved is the effectiveness of Title 8 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which assures fair housing to all Americans without regard to race, color, national origin, or religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.601" offset="455158">The effectiveness of the Act is threatened in this case by a claim that the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits Congress from providing that civil actions under the Act be tried by the court and not by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.276" offset="517851">We submit that the court trial and remedy provisions of Title 8 are constitutional as within the power of Congress granted by Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Seventh Amendment preserving jury trials in suits that common law is not applicable to litigation under Title 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.418" offset="606459">Briefly, the facts of the case or that petitioner who was Black, while a patient in a hospital in November 1969, asked a White friend to find an apartment for her.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.924" offset="652434">The friend found an apartment owned by respondents and it appeared that a lease would be, or perhaps even was, consummated with respondents’ agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.946" offset="684513">But when it was discovered that the petitioner was Black, they refused to go through with the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.355" offset="706142">The District Court found, and it is supported in the record, that petitioner was denied the apartment because of her race.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.262" offset="733832">The court entered a temporary restraining order on November 17, 1969 ordering respondents not to rent the apartment to anyone else pending resolution of the dispute and then did a preliminary injunction on December 19 to the same general effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.952" offset="796526">And the court urged both parties to try to settle the dispute, but this turned out to be impossible and efforts to conciliate went on over a period of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.792" offset="835918">And more than six months after the action had commenced, petitioner could no longer wait for the case to be concluded and took another apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.719" offset="867579">Her counsel withdrew the application for an order directing that the apartment be rented to her though went on with other aspects of the case and asked for punitive damages, costs, and counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.074" offset="921078">Following trial, the court made an award of $250 in punitive damages but denied counsel fees and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.001" offset="956709">Weighing on the one hand the importance of petitioner’s rights and, on the other hand, the fact that the respondent had been denied rent for the apartment during the period the case was before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.572" offset="1002998">The respondents urged in the District Court that the case should have been heard by a jury, but the District Court rejected this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.951" offset="1028598">Respondents renewed this claim in the Seventh Circuit and the Court of Appeals agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.765" offset="1047824">We submit that this decision of the Court of Appeals is wrong, that it will seriously impair the effectiveness of Title VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.841" offset="1080111">That it involves a misreading of the plain unequivocal language of Title VIII and of the intention of Congress in enacting the Fair Housing Act under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and is wrong concerning the requirements of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.382" offset="1138312">At this point of the litigation, there no longer seems to be any serious dispute between the parties concerning the language of Title VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.032" offset="1172898">Respondents in their brief offer at best a cursory argument that the statute is unclear and put to this Court as the only question presented whether the Seventh Amendment requires jury trials in Title VIII cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.146" offset="1233293">In resolving the issues before the Court, we submit that we should first look at the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.947" offset="1256490">The provisions which we are construing, Section 812 (c), provides that “the ourt” shall grant relief and it uses the word “court” in that subsection as well as elsewhere in the statute in a variety of ways which can only mean “judge” and “judge acting without a jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="315.638" offset="1339350">For example, the statute speaks of the court granting permanent or temporary injunctions or temporary restraining orders and of awarding costs.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="323.951" offset="1372578">So, how does that help you very much, Mr. Greenberg, when it's -- of course the jury doesn't engage in granting injunctions ever?</text>
            <text syncTime="333.116" offset="1409254">Is it?</text>

          <turn speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="334.229" stopTime="394.322">
            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="334.229" offset="1413642">Well, it helps me a great deal because the word “court,” we submit, is used consistently throughout the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.124" offset="1433287">And if the word “court” is used in connection with injunctions and counsel fees and continuances and conciliation and in several other contexts, we submit that within a single section the word “court,” whenever it refers to damages, means the same as the word “court” in all those other connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.021" offset="1508833">We submit the word had to have been used consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.024" offset="1532865">Indeed, the word “court” not only in this statute but throughout the entire Federal Code and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as we set forth in our brief, consistently invariably means court and judge acting without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.961" offset="1592633">When the Congress intends to use the term “jury,” it knows how to do so and we set forth in our brief the citation of a large number of statutes in which Congress said that certain issues that it would be drive by a jury and not by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.900" offset="1648327">And, indeed, in this record --</text>

            <text syncTime="394.322" offset="1654073">Do you need to -- do you need to rest on that so firmly, Mr. Greenberg?</text>
            <text syncTime="400.727" offset="1679673">Isn't it a more important to question whether this is or is not a common law action?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="415.415" offset="1738397">Well, the first point in our argument that this is (Inaudible), that this is mode of procedure which has been prescribed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.907" offset="1772356">And that the prescription by Congress of this mode of procedure under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment is entitled to great weight indeed, as even controlling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.784" offset="1807882">And I first wanted to make absolutely unequivocally clear that this indeed, is what Congress has done.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="529.733" offset="2195644">Well, in fact, I think probably the commerce block -- power was invoked and the statute does in part rest upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.090" offset="2221140">In fact, I'm certain the statute does in part, rest upon the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.591" offset="2235141">But it rests upon a specific constitutional directives to implement two particulars of amendments regarding a very important factor in American life to which the Congress is directing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.422" offset="2278400">The commerce power is more diffused by but I would say the commerce power would be adequate and it has involved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.060" offset="2321032">Just going beyond my effort to establish that they made court and court acting without a jury, the Fair Housing Act originally was a part of a 1966 Civil Rights Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.505" offset="2370769">And in that Act -- in that Bill, there was the Fair Housing Act and there was the Jury Selection Act -- jury Selection Bill which later became the Jury Selection Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.490" offset="2414759">In that single piece of legislation, Congress used the word “court” and “jury” in juxtaposition dealing with jury selection, and then used the word “court” in dealing with Fair Housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.783" offset="2467840">It'd be quite strange whether in a single piece of legislation, which later they -- then was enact -- two parts of which were enacted two weeks apart in 1968 with terms given to it used differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.599" offset="2507128">But I will go beyond that part of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.253" offset="2517786">I will submit that the Congress meant court and it meant court acting without a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.583" offset="2603050">One would then have to look at some of the other attributes of the action and see whether or not, for example as mentioned in the footnote against Ross versus Bernhard, this is an action in which juries might have particular difficulty in coming to a decision or whether as in the Katchen case for example, whether there was some need for particular expedition in the action and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.377" offset="2686224">But, we do not have any of that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.152" offset="2693329">In fact, this case -- in -- the only cases that we're aware of, in fact, in which Congress had -- in which this Court has passed upon the power of Congress to require enforcement of statutes which it had enacted by court sitting without juries are NLRB against Jones and Laughlin Steel, and Katchen against Landy.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.349" offset="2782145">In NLRB against Jones and Laughlin Steel, this court held that backpay and other monetary awards might be made by the NLRB and enforced by the Court of Appeals without intervention by a jury because the right involved did not exist at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.768" offset="2843794">In Katchen, the Court held that adjudication of the validity of a preference in summary proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act also might be made sitting by a Court without a jury and the decision in that case, as I understand it, rested upon the fact that Congress determ -- had determined the need for speed and efficiency in the essentially equitable nature of bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.132" offset="5093251">When I argued this appeal before the Seventh Circuit in Chicago in February 1972 most of the questions that came to me from the bench, at least at the start of the oral arguments, related to what the actual posture of this case was before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.869" offset="5148212">Now I think my Brother in giving you the general outline of what the facts of this case are, overlooked a very important factual aspect of the case which was at issue in those oral arguments and which the Seventh Circuit drew concession from the appellee at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.434" offset="5230446">First of all, this was a case, Justice White, for damages on the basis of a civil wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.039" offset="5256882">It was a tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.880" offset="5264300">There are analogs in the common law which the Seventh Circuit discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.762" offset="5287811">The important thing which the Seventh Circuit seek to -- sought to find out about this case when it was in tried is what issues were before the trial court when the availability or non-availability of a jury became critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.155" offset="5345384">And those issues before the trial court on the day of trial, October 26, 1970, were simply the issues of discrimination and the issue of money damages, compensatory damages, and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.809" offset="5400033">And this is most clearly brought out, I think, on page 47 (a) of the appendix where the trial court, when it was summing up after all the trial, summed up the evidence and said, “Therefore, the only issue remaining for this hearing today, the final hearing on the question of discrimination and the claim for compensatory and punitive damages.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.557" offset="5498984">The issue of discrimination and the issue of damages or what was before the court and I listen very carefully when my Brother and opened to see if there would be any discussion of the fact that this was after all just an action for damages albeit a statutory cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.948" offset="5572545">And I think there is ample authority in the brief which I have cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.908" offset="5592398">To the effect that there is no cleavage with respect to the application of the Seventh Amendment between cases which are brought on statutory actions and cases which are common law in their origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.330" offset="5650077">There are two main areas of legal dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.407" offset="5662407">One is a statutory argument which my Brother first got into in which depends on how you read the statute.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1408.328" offset="5710054">Well, going to the Seventh Amendment itself, what do you think the Seventh Amendment means when it says, “In all common law action,” if that's the language I think it is, “in all common law action”?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_scott" startTime="1423.774" stopTime="1639.134">
            <label>Mr. Robert Scott</label>
            <text syncTime="1423.774" offset="5771807">It means that in all actions in which under a three-test which this court approved of in a recent case, Ross versus Bernhard, footnote 10 to that case, there are three ways you decide what the Seventh Amendment means in any given circumstances on which the case is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.469" offset="5838576">First of all, you look at the premerger custom with respect to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.388" offset="5854250">Second of all, you look at the remedy requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.517" offset="5870864">And thirdly, you determine what the practical abilities and limitations of jurors are with respect to the issues that are going to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.511" offset="5914749">Now, Ross versus Bernhard was decided while our case was pending before the District Court before it ever got up to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.258" offset="5941812">And I cited Ross versus Bernhard at the time of oral arguments on the jury issue before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.370" offset="5974204">When the Seventh Circuit decided this case, it tracked, if you will, the three standards in Ross versus Bernhard and I would like to track them again with you so that we can see how the Seventh Amendment does apply to this particular cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.311" offset="6042018">Bearing in mind how that action was postured when it reached the time in the course of its litigation when the availability of a jury became important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.863" offset="6084232">And are --  I mentioned that I just parenthetically because this case started out of course with claims for injunctive relief and it is part of the argument by the petitioner in this case that the granting of Seventh Amendment rights to this case, in this type of case, would emasculate the statute because then you couldn't have the speedy relief that's necessary to handle discrimination in housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.755" offset="6187781">This case is an excellent example of how speedy relief is available consistent with the Seventh Amendment and the reason is, all of the speedy type of relief, the injunctive relief, had been granted in this case well before the availability of a jury became important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.764" offset="6263850">It was decided, as just, as Chief Justice Burger suggested, by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.017" offset="6280777">Injunctions were granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.754" offset="6291749">But to move to the test in Ross versus Berhnahrd and how they apply to our circumstances, the first two tests are the premerger custom in the nature of the relief granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.850" offset="6336157">To my way of thinking, these two tests really embodied the traditional historical analytic approach that this Court has adapted in its cases -- in all of its cases determining the applicability of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.627" offset="6395298">There are two ways of applying the first test, namely, the premerger custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.490" offset="6410658">One is the literal approach which my Brother -- and suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.819" offset="6424033">In other words, you'll look at the common laws that existed in 1791 in England and if this type of cause of action did not exist by that name at that time, then you have no Seventh Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.459" offset="6470635">There is another approach and that is the approach suggested by Justice Story in Parsons versus Bedford, and that case which was cited with approval in Ross versus Bernhard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.576" offset="6515043">Justice Story said that the Seventh Amendment, the preservative power of the Seventh Amendment reaches all lawsuits except those which are of equity or admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.941" offset="6560496">In other words, you look at the dichotomy which existed in England between the law and equity and you decide not necessarily whether this particular statutory cause of action existed by this name at that time, but really what jurisdiction would a cause of action such as this--</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.555" offset="6663001">Story, that's right, but I think you are right about the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.763" offset="6683794">In other words, if you apply Story’s analysis, you go beyond the literal approach to determine what the nature of this cause of action is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.203" offset="6717544">And again, when it was tried it was an action for damages, compensatory and punitive on the basis of a civil wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.884" offset="6752235">Our argument and the argument adapted by the Seventh Circuit was that that particular type of cause of action would certainly have belonged in the law side in England in 1791.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.326" offset="6798002">Go on to the next test which is probably the easiest of the three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.931" offset="6812421">The relief grant -- requested in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.724" offset="6827677">The relief, the only relief which was tried was money damages, compensatory and punitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.576" offset="6879086">I'll clarify that because I wanted to do that the very start and that is one of the questions that the Seventh Circuit went at us with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.466" offset="6978664">By that time, as my recollection serves me, District Judge Reynolds had already granted his injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.991" offset="7016699">So after the -- at the first pretrial conference, this came up and when I was explaining this to the Seventh Circuit, District Judge Candle said, “Well, it can be brought up under Rule 16 in that fashion, can it?” and I said “well, that is exactly how it did occur.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.654" offset="7079393">And, in the next pretrial order that issued out from that conference the District Judge directed that the trial would be on the issue of actual damages and discrimination, and this was formalized --</text>
