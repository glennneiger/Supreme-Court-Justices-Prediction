            <label>Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn</label>
            <text syncTime="29.455" offset="194560">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.787" offset="207935">The petitioner in this case entered a plea of guilty to the charge of sodomy in Multnomah County, was placed on a term of five years probation and as a condition of the probation he was ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of his court-appointed attorney fees as well as the total of $375.00 for the cost of the investigator hired by his court-appointed attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.660" offset="303438">The petitioner believes that these conditions of probation, of reimbursement deny him due process as well as equal protection, and are an impermissible burden upon his right to counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.066" offset="364983">Now, petitioner believes that this condition of probation, that he repay his court-appointed attorneys fees are an impediment to the free exercise of his right to counsel as guaranteed by this Court in Gideon versus Wainwright and recently reinforced in Argersinger versus Hamlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.783" offset="447843">The Oregon practice which is beginning now, this is one of the first cases will have the effect of placing a financial penalty upon those indigents who need legal help, but cannot afford to retain their own counsels.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.344" offset="522136">Now this issue recently was decided by the Supreme Court of the State of California in the case of in re Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.286" offset="557871">Now, the California Supreme Court held that the same type condition of probation as we have here was unconstitutional, because it would place an impermissible burden upon the petitioner's right to counsel in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.504" offset="614713">The California Court reasoned that even though there was no indication there that the petitioner had been denied her right to counsel, since she actually was represented by court-appointed counsel that the record did not show that she was ever advised of this potential liability as to the repayment and reimbursement to the county for the cost of this counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.410" offset="702380">Petitioner submits that such advice is also absent in the present record that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.317" offset="729966">The California Court also felt that if the petitioner had had knowledge that she may have to repay the cost of her court-appointed counsel and as the knowledge of this potential burdens spreads that it could very well chill future indigents from exercising their Sixth Amendment right to counsel, rather than risking having to repay them as a condition of the probation should they be fortunate enough to receive probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.986" offset="1256699">I believe that the thrust of Gideon Argersinger are to the effect that an indigent, a man who cannot afford counsel or where it would work a hardship upon him has a right to appointed counsel, but under no other conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.568" offset="1323050">Now it's this chilling effect, the possible limiting of the right to counsel that the petitioner believes is at issue here and is the main issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.301" offset="4929933">However, as Judge Fort indicated in his dissenting opinion, there is nothing to support such a construction as there is nothing in ORS 161.675, paragraph 2 or ORS 137.550 that affords a defendant in a revocation proceeding the same exemptions provided in other Oregon judgment debtors as appears in chapter 23 of the Oregon Revised Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.329" offset="5054067">For this reason, Judge Fort and petitioner believes that the Oregon statute is essentially no different from that statute condemned in James versus Strange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.701" offset="5107566">Another difference is that the Kansas Statute was civil in nature, the Oregon Statute as applied as a condition of probation is part of the criminal procedure and that as in effect of this, that an indigent whose probation is revoked is in effect being punished for a debt owed to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.524" offset="5210802">And it does create a gulf between the man with money and a man without.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.868" offset="5236193">Now, even though the Court of Appeals did hold that a probationer in Oregon could not be imprisoned for the failure to pay, unless the default was intentional, the Court when it made that statement did not attempt to distinguish the Oregon Statute from the Kansas Statute there as nothing was said about the petitioner being able to claim his exemptions in a revocation hearing, the same as other judgment debtors are allowed to do so in Oregon in civil proceedings against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.388" offset="5370253">Now for this reason, petitioner believes that Oregon law discriminates against those convicted indigent defendants who are placed on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.974" offset="5412676">Now, it does not apply to any of the other convicted indigents who are sentenced to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.748" offset="5439739">And for this reason, petitioner submits that it does not make sense to carve a class out of a class, such as convicted indigents to carve out of that class, a class of convicted indigents who are put on probation and apply the condition and requirement that they repay against them only, when as a matter of practice have been unable to find any case where a man sentenced to the penitentiary has in fact been sentenced to pay and required to pay the cost of his court-appointed attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.118" offset="5601176">So although he is assessed other costs, -- I have no found no case that indicates he has been required to repay he cost of his court-appointed attorneys fees as only probationers are now required to do in Oregon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.849" offset="6268134">First of all with regard to the chilling effect question, the question was raised by Mr. Justice Blackmun, as to whether or not in any case, in any jurisdiction a judge could impose a condition such as the one imposed on Prince Eric Fuller in this case and we would submit that with the exception of California, which apparently has decided in Re  Allen that you can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.521" offset="6358831">The answer is probably yes in most jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.832" offset="6368026">Certainly, I believe it's yes in Oregon and in fact there is in the Federal District Court in Oregon at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.489" offset="6390700">Another case, Washington versus Music, which has been stayed pending the result in this case, where the judge purported to make exactly this condition of probation based upon his inherent power and not apply any statutory power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.530" offset="6498847">The case in other respect similar to this one, it would appear that the defendant in fact was capable of paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.416" offset="6522462">But I want to point out to the Court that the way attorneys are appointed in these situations is usually -- it usually arises as a result of a relatively summary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.622" offset="6563213">An individual is brought before an arraigning magistrate and the first concern of the magistrate is that the individual be advised that he has been charged with the criminal offense and secondly, to determine whether or not the individual has counsel and since usually he doesn't in Oregon or for that matter, almost anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.085" offset="6625071">The next inquiry is, can you afford one?</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.545" offset="6634893">And the answer frequently is not a simple yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.814" offset="6643984">The answer is, I don't know, because the individual may be for the first time encountering the question of whether he can afford counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.522" offset="6670838">The court will in most instances err on the side of appointing an attorney, rather than let the defendant go without counsel any longer and I would submit that that is definitely the best choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.595" offset="6715141">The individual needs help then and the court in rather summary fashion is going to get him a lawyer unless the court is convinced that he can get his own.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.560" offset="7238949">It indicates that the majority of counties are utilizing the practice, although to a limited extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.815" offset="8760007">At least with regard to revocation under this situation because in some respects this is the easiest condition to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.078" offset="8789055">If an individual is really determined to survive on probation, rather than have it revoked he is going to meet this if anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.610" offset="8811207">It is the easiest affirmative index to give to the Court that he is meeting the terms of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.753" offset="8831791">And so we're confident that it's going to work in those few instances in which it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.809" offset="8863974">Now, Justice Rehnquist asked about sanctions and the answer to that, I think was fairly well heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.006" offset="8896784">The sanction is contempt and the sanction applies not just to individuals placed on probation, the sanction speaks to all convicted individuals who have this condition imposed upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.195" offset="8937535">And Mr. Kuhn has suggested this has never happened with respect to a penitentiary inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.215" offset="8953626">We have no statistics to show that one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.600" offset="8967105">Practically speaking, however, I suspect that's true, not because the courts as a matter of practice are trying to distinguish between those who are placed on probation and those who are not, but simply because people who go to jail by and large have even less chance to improve upon their original condition of indigency than to those who remain outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.724" offset="9035651">And in fact, one of the reasons sometimes that an individual is granted probation in addition to other considerations is the fact that he's got a job and he is maintaining the job and he is caring for his family and he showed another ways that he is a contributing citizen, whatever his particular offense may have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.663" offset="9095419">So I think the reasons for that distinction if in fact they are accurately portrayed, and I am willing to concede that they probably are, are reasons which arises out of the particular concern involved, and there's really no way ever to get around that kind of problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gillette</label>
            <text syncTime="2357.077" offset="9505019">That happens, they tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.575" offset="9519020">Now with regard, if I may to the permit of equal protection question, Counsel has urged this Court as it was urged upon the Oregon Court, that James versus Strange is applicable here, because the Oregon Statute just like the Kansas Statute in some way affirmatively denies to individuals subjected to this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.528" offset="9598851">Those exemptions which are granted to other judgment debtors in fact this isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.349" offset="9622152">The Court of Appeals decision specifically says that it isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.194" offset="9633541">It says these people are entitled to the same exemptions everybody else is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.657" offset="9647334">I have set forth the statutory scheme in my brief and I think it shows that those exemptions are afforded in the same way they are afforded to every other judgment debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.301" offset="9677949">So I would submit if that ground in James versus Strange was the full reason this Court felt constrained to strike that statute, then James versus Strange is just not the point at all in this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.539" offset="9730926">Now, I see from my notes that I have covered the other particular point that I wanted to mention to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.494" offset="9762691">Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has other questions I am done.</text>
