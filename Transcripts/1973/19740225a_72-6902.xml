            <label>Mr. Herbert A. Rosenthal, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="45.171" offset="257463">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.710" offset="259553">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.378" offset="274286">The events in this case began three years ago this month.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.034" offset="288914">In early February of 1971, Metropolitan Police Officer Marrion Green was told by a reliable informer that Lonnie Gooding, the petitioner in this case, was selling narcotics from his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.279" offset="345861">Mr. Green investigated and on February 9, 1971, using this purportedly reliable informer, caused a controlled or supervised buy to be made, and apparently the informer bought a small amount of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.330" offset="410018">Two days later on February 11, Officer Green, having been satisfied that a violation of federal law was probably taking place, made application to the United States Magistrate for the District of Columbia for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.959" offset="464562">This application had been approved by an Assistant United States Attorney as an application under federal law for violations of the federal narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.474" offset="506671">The magistrate so-found after reviewing the affidavits and issued a search warrant, and he did direct the search could be executed at any time of the day or night.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.530" offset="550870">Officer Green and six -- other Metropolitan Police Officers on the evening of February 12, 1971 did enter Mr. Gooding’s apartment and did find various narcotics and of narcotic influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.083" offset="601130">As a result thereof, Mr. Gooding was indicted for violation of federal narcotics laws and that’s where we stand today.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.518" offset="634776">The search here was a search for violations of the Federal Law by the members of the Metropolitan Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.445" offset="662570">No -- at no time during the application for the search warrant or in the investigation was there any indication that a violation of metropolitan -- of the District of Columbia Code was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.298" offset="713979">The entire search and the entire process was geared to find -- searching out for violations of federal narcotics laws and probable cause having been shown in a search warrant, because of those alleged violations, was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.333" offset="774060">We filed a motion to suppress the evidence in the district court, and the district court granted the motion on the basis that the federal nighttime -- the federal narcotic search warrant procedure standard had to be modified by the District of Columbia Code for reformat provisions in Title XXIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.268" offset="853786">The government appealed and the three judges of the Court of Appeals, although all voting to reverse, nonetheless all reached different opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.532" offset="890880">Each judge determined that 21 U.S.C. 879 (a) was the controlling standard because this was a search for violations of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.108" offset="929228">Judge Wilkey who wrote the majority opinion indicated that if the magistrate had probable cause to believe that the narcotics could be found at any time of the day or night, then Section 879 (a) authorized him to direct execution at any time of the day or night.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.538" offset="998922">Judge Fahy interpreted the statue a little bit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.618" offset="1015223">Prior to the effective date of Section 879 (a), narcotic searches have been governed by former 18 U.S.C. Section 1405.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.403" offset="1054407">That law was well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.347" offset="1062139">If the magistrate had probable cause to issue the basic warrant itself, he could authorize its service at any time of the day or night without any further findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.178" offset="1105502">Judge Fahy felt that Section 18 -- Section 1405 was carried forward right into Section 879 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="266.042" offset="1140924">So, all the magistrate had to find was probable cause with the warrant itself, and if he made that finding, he could authorize nighttime service without anything more.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.839" offset="1180108">Judge Robinson, in effect, dissented in principle from his colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.251" offset="1197767">He felt that the last seven words of Section 879 (a) and for its service at such time meant something.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.196" offset="1229531">It meant that the magistrate had to be presented with and had to find some justification for a nighttime search.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.939" offset="1256490">The police had to offer some good reason why they needed to go into a person’s home at night as opposed to going in at the daytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.778" offset="1287837">He concluded that the police had to show some form of reasonable cause or exigent circumstances before they could be authorized to get a nighttime warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.411" offset="1326393">He felt that the statute itself, it was plain on its face as to that requirement although it’s true the statute does not spell out the particulars that one has to show, but then on the other hand, neither does this Court’s recently revised Rule 41 state what is “reasonable cause shown” for a nighttime search.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.234" offset="1397656">So, it’s obviously within the competence of a court to make those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.323" offset="1422002">Judge Robinson, however, even though the government below had conceded that this warrant would not need any particularized showing, nevertheless held that it satisfied his interpretation of Section 879 (a), and he voted to sustain the warrant and to reverse the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.717" offset="1495667">We believe there are two basic issues to present here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.450" offset="1510504">The first is this Court must decide whether this search is governed by 21 U.S.C. 879 (a) or whether it’s governed by 23 D.C. Code Sections 521, 522, or 523. Once that decision is made, the Court must then determine whether the warrant meets the tests of the statute which it so selects.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.154" offset="1601411">There are good reasons why either of the statutory procedures could be determined to be the one that is the guiding one.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.467" offset="1634638">For example, Section 879 (a) is in the United States Code, it’s federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.803" offset="1655954">It concerns itself with violations of the federal narcotics laws and, indeed, here we have a search for violations of the federal narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.414" offset="1690436">Moreover, a United States magistrate issued it.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.216" offset="1701616">In effect, he was issuing a federal warrant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.275" offset="1721887">The whole search has the aura of a federal search, and that’s one good reason, most likely why each judge of the Court of Appeals below determined that 897 (a) should be the controlling standard. On the other hand, it may be that Title XXIII of the D.C. Code which became effective February 1, 1971 should be the controlling standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.555" offset="1806942">The entire investigation, search warrant application, and search were conducted solely by members of the District of Columbia Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.109" offset="1833169">There were no federal officers of any type in any way involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.955" offset="1852604">It’s clear from reading Chapter 5 of Title XXIII of the D.C. Code that the imp -- that the provisions are broad enough to authorize the District of Columbia Police to apply for and receive warrants issued for violations of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.924" offset="1916447">Moreover, Congress, when it passed this law, thought it was passing a complete and comprehensive code of criminal procedure for the District of Columbia and, obviously, since the District of Columbia Police are our only local police force it seems logical that any search warrant that they apply for under federal law should be governed by the provisions of then recently enacted Title XXIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.374" offset="2018220">The government, however, suggests that this search should be governed by Title XXXIII, Section 414 of the District of Columbia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.403" offset="2050403">That Section is found in the District of Columbia’s Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. All three judges below rejected the argument that Section 414 could govern this search.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.289" offset="2101917">For example, Judge Robinson indicated that the local provisions, that is Title XXXIII, extends only to searches based on suspected narcotics transmissions of the district’s own drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.924" offset="2148415">Here, every warrant document indicates that the search was conducted for violations of the federal narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.184" offset="2181433">No party to this search warrant application, its issuance, or its execution had any inkling that the search might be governed by Title XXXIII of the District of Columbia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.106" offset="2245172">Now, the government is seeking that this warrant be governed by Title XXXIII because there’s a strong possibility that it was invalid for nighttime search.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.065" offset="2289058">Now we believe that it’s highly improper at this time to transform the warrant from a federal warrant into a D.C. warrant, especially since the government wants to do it to justify the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.472" offset="2338586">The government has to stand or fall on the four corners of the warrant, and every corner of that warrant is marked federal law, 26 U.S.C. Section 4704.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.379" offset="2382263">Moreover, the procedure regularities of a varying search warrant procedure codes must be adhered to and it’s important that, in this respect, that the magistrate know under what search warrant provision he’s being asked to issue a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.782" offset="2447882">Once this Court determines which search warrant procedure this warrant should be tested by, the task then becomes determining does the warrant need that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.042" offset="2496888">If the warrant is governed by Title XXIII of the District of Columbia Code, the answer is clear, the warrant is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.937" offset="2528444">The government doesn’t argue to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.025" offset="2536803">The warrant, on its face, shows that the requisite requirements of Title XXIII were not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.618" offset="2559269">They’re spelled out very specifically in the statute, and there’s no indication anywhere in the warrant papers that any of those circumstances existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.321" offset="2589989">Well, except -- doesn’t the government claim here that the search was not conducted in the nighttime?</text>

            <text syncTime="635.089" offset="2617156">Yes, the government for the first time in this entire case is saying that 9:30 at night, some-four hours after sunset, is not night.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.102" offset="2645159">So, to that extent, I suppose the government would say that the conditions of the XXIII were complied with, wouldn’t it?</text>

            <text syncTime="656.573" offset="2703047">Now, if the Court decides that Section 879 (a) is the standard, then we also believe that the warrant is defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.053" offset="2737006">We believe that the plain language of Section 879 (a) requires some showing beyond basic probable cause for the warrant itself to justify intrusion into a man’s home at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.094" offset="2785176">Had Congress intended to carry forward the interpret -- former Section 1405, it’s obvious it would’ve carried it forward intact without changing it except expanding the types of drugs, narcotics, and other substances to which it applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.517" offset="2850795">The government failed to do this, and Congress failed to do this. Instead, it issued a statute which, on its face, says there has to be something more for a nighttime servoce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.444" offset="4754495">Finally, the government is alleging, is claiming here that should the petitioner prevail, nonetheless, the evidence should not be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.996" offset="4792738">We believe that Congress has established search warrant standards and if those standards are not enforced to the suppression mechanism, then the will of Congress is going to be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.874" offset="4844251">Congressionally created procedures are just as important as the constitutional procedures, and they must be met, they must be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.750" offset="4879778">Moreover, recently in the Calandra case we believe that this Court reinforced the continuing validity of the “Weeks” rule for suppression of evidence at trial that was unlawfully seized when it’s being used against the person from whom it seized, and that’s precisely our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.973" offset="4940591">We’re not asking this Court to expand the exclusionary rule in any respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.459" offset="5094609">For example, in Miller versus United States the police made a no-knock entry in violation of the US Code statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.641" offset="5127314">This Court held that the evidence must be suppressed because of the illegality of the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.996" offset="5148735">So, I don’t think there’s any case that suggests the fact that a statutory procedure is violated, is worthy of less protection than when a constitutional procedure is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.192" offset="5197531">It appears that if the warrant is invalid, either because it violates the constitution or it violates some statutory requirement, then the search must be invalidated and the evidence must be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.605" offset="5247164">Thus, we don’t believe that this good faith argument should be granted because any time the magistrate makes a mistake of law the government is going to claim “well, everybody was in good faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.832" offset="5296065">But, that’s not the case because if the magistrate makes a mistake, then the paper he is issuing is really just a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.070" offset="5321038">It really isn’t a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.217" offset="5325636">It’s invalid and the whole purpose of having a magistrate is to make sure that the police have established probable cause and complied with all the statutory requisites before they enter a person’s home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.994" offset="5380702">Hence, for these reasons, we’re asking the Court to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.321" offset="5442038">In this case, District of Columbia police officers executed a narcotics search warrant at 9:30 in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.923" offset="5468473">In so doing, they were complying fully with the command of the magistrate in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.306" offset="5493969">The magistrate had, in issuing the warrant, expressly authorized its execution at any time of the day or night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.959" offset="5524584">The application for the warrant, recited facts which it is not disputed, established probable cause with respect to an offense under Title XXVI of the US Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.084" offset="5565127">We submit also that it cannot seriously be disputed that the facts were cited in the application for the warrant made out in offense under Title XXXIII of the District of Columbia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.377" offset="5618207">The issue was whether evidence seized when this warrant was executed in full compliance with its terms should be suppressed because the magistrate erred in authorizing execution at any time of the day or night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.134" offset="5673273">Now, since the facts were cited in the application for the warrant made out a violation both of the District of Columbia and of the United States Code, it’s our view that the nighttime execution was proper, if it was proper under either local district law or under the applicable federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.883" offset="5768255">We contend that it was lawful under both, and we contend that the choice is not between the federal law and Title XXIII of the District of Columbia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.319" offset="5810051">As I will argue, that is simply a provision that is not and cannot be applicable to a narcotics search in the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.770" offset="7963794">They simply were talking about the relative applicability of the Title XXI provision and the Title XXIII provision without having had presented to them the argument that we present to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.841" offset="8012069">Now, with respect to Section 879 (a), the US Code provision, unless there are any specific questions I think the necessity of a special showing of exigent circumstances or the like for authorization of nighttime execution of a federal narcotics search warrant has been fully covered in our briefs and in the opinions of the two District of Columbia Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.393" offset="8106318">With respect to Title XXIII, Judge Gesell held that all warrants issued to District of Columbia police were subject to the provisions of Title XXIII of the D.C. Code regarding the necessity of a special showing for the authorization of nighttime execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.998" offset="8172774">Now, we think this position is beset with insurmountable difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.312" offset="8197956">In the first place, in order to avoid the impact of Title XXXIII, petitioner has had to argue that this was a federal warrant application, that it was issued by a federal magistrate, that it was for a violation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.977" offset="8260650">And then, he says “well, if it was okay under federal law, let’s put that to one side and let’s apply local law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.583" offset="8295131">That is, he wants to say, on the one hand, you can’t apply Title XXXIII because this was a federal warrant and, on the other hand, he wants to say you must apply Title XXIII of the D.C. Code because these were District of Columbia police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.268" offset="8353855">Now, we think that he can’t have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.539" offset="8370887">Also, the alleged policy basis for his argument is completely undercut by the existence of Title XXXIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.081" offset="8397113">Let us assume for the moment that you don’t consider properly before you or you don’t wish to decide our contention that this search was valid under Title XXXIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.329" offset="8434103">Nevertheless, what kind of a policy do we have reflected in Title XXIII, which Judge Gesell found, which says that all searches must be -- nighttime searches must have a special justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.638" offset="8487288">If the District of Columbia police need no special justification to make a local nighttime narcotics search and to get a warrant for that purpose, and if under the federal law no special justification is required, how can it be that the D.C. Police, what policy is it that makes the D.C. police make a special justification for a nighttime warrant to enforce federal law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.699" offset="8591569">I think there simply is no rational basis for interpreting Title XXIII to impose such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.760" offset="8635768">Now, I’d like to turn at this point, if I may, to the exclusionary rule argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.216" offset="8661577">Let us assume that the magistrate erred in directing the police to execute this warrant at any time in the day or night, and that alt least five members of this Court of the view that contrary to the conclusions of the three Appellate Courts that have previously considered this issue, the applicable statutes require the magistrate to elicit a special showing in support of the nighttime execution authorization that he conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.449" offset="8766589">Does it necessarily follow that the evidence seized under this warrant should be excluded?</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.136" offset="8793339">Petitioner contends that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.610" offset="8803161">He argues, in effect, that any irregularity in the issuance or execution of a search warrant, whether or not have constitutional dimensions, whether or not willful or flagrant, whether or not done only after being expressly authorized by a neutral and detached magistrate must lead to exclusion of the evidence obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.446" offset="8886544">The primary reason he advances for this view is the necessity to avoid tainting the purity of our judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.057" offset="8916950">Now, we contend that the application of the exclusionary rule in this case would represent an inappropriate extension of the rule to or beyond its outermost limits and would seriously disserve the interest of justice and undermine the integrity of the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.438" offset="8986540">In the first place, we are not dealing here with a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.773" offset="9003886">This is a case in which exclusion, if there is to be any, must come from an invocation of the Court’s supervisory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.139" offset="9037322">Now, in the McNabb case which is perhaps the leading case on the question of supervisory powers, the Court described the occasion for the exercise of such powers for exclusion as follows, and I’m quoting from page 345 of Volume 318.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.242" offset="9101688">“Plainly, a conviction resting on evidence secured through such a flagrant disregard of the procedure which Congress has commanded cannot be allowed to stand without making the Courts themselves accomplices in willful disobedience of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.927" offset="9168457">Now, we contend that this case does not come anywhere near that standard for the exercise of the Court’s supervisory power for exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.598" offset="9211089">Now, secondly, we point out that if there was error here, it was made in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.532" offset="9230838">The police and the magistrate can hardly be accused of willful disobedience of a clear statutory mandate when eight of the nine appellate judges, who have thus far expressed their views on the question, uphold the propriety of the authorization of nighttime execution under facts such as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.108" offset="9301159">Therefore, the objective of deterrence of a official misconduct cannot possibly be furthered by the application of an exclusionary rule in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.490" offset="9350687">Finally, the error, if there was an error, was that of the magistrate and not that of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.295" offset="9377959">The warrant application did not specifically request authorization for nighttime execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.041" offset="9404918">It was the magistrate who directed that it’d be served in any time of the day or night.</text>

            <text syncTime="2455.380" offset="9898318">If they went in at 3:00 in the morning after waiting until they were sure everybody was asleep with no justification whatsoever for doing that, then even though the warrant had authorized nighttime execution, we might have a question of an independent constitutional violation, but we are talking here about a request for suppression on the basis of a statute and on the basis of an error by the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.970" offset="10000614">I think it has not heretofore been suggested that the error was that of the police officers, and I don’t see how if the magistrate made a mistake about what the law was in good faith, how we can suppose that there would be effect of deterrence of police officers who presumably are far less sophisticated in their interpretation of a provision like the 21 U.S.C. 879 (a) than the magistrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.825" offset="12440033">The argument that the government has made in this case, both here and below, were also made in the Thomas case, that is, the warrant should be tested by Title XXXIII Section 414 of the D.C. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.959" offset="12484545">That Court elected not to do so, and I don’t believe it said specifically, but it certainly means that in this conflict situation they held this to be, in effect, a federal warrant because they said Section 879 (a) governs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.267" offset="12541806">We have the exact same situation here, D.C. police getting a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.769" offset="12559778">The District of Columbia Code said “okay, Section 879 (a) governs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.332" offset="12578064">Our code, 33-414, doesn’t govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.059" offset="12589035">I think that’s kind of your state law interpretation that this Court ought to give great deference to in interpreting this warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.181" offset="12629473">I think both the legislative history of Section 879 (a) and recently revised Rule 41 gives this Court no guidance as to what standards “reasonable cause shown or probable cause were at service at such time” means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.521" offset="12694883">Don’t think that means that an argument could be used to say that this Court did not mean that you had to make some showing for nighttime search when you get the case in asking for an interpretation of Rule 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.757" offset="12739814">Similarly, the fact that the legislative history of Section 879 (a) does not give any indication of possible standards does not mean that Congress did not intend some additional showing for nighttime service to be required by the police and the magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.201" offset="12805538">Thank you.</text>
