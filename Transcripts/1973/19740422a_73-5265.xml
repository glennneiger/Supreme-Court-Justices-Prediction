            <text syncTime="47.552" offset="266971">Mr. Adams, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Adams</label>
            <text syncTime="67.620" offset="347220">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.181" offset="361430">This case involves the question of interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.167" offset="377417">The question is whether a wage earner’s postbankruptcy receipt of his tax refund check is property within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.260" offset="425796">The bankrupt contends that the disposition of this case should be controlled by this Court’s decision four years ago in Lines versus Frederick.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.891" offset="472294">In Lines, the Court analyzed the meaning of the word “property” and rejected a mechanistic accounting-type approach to defining property.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.035" offset="520882">For example, Lines involved the question of whether or not a bankrupt’s vacation pay was property.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.602" offset="551184">It was clear in Lines that the vacation pay was entirely earned and accrued at the time of the bankruptcy and it was also clear that the vacation pay was the result of labor that had been preformed in a prebankruptcy past.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.910" offset="620356">The facts in this case are similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.080" offset="629029">Mr. Kokoszka, the bankrupt was employed for three-and-a-half months in the year 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.647" offset="659331">He claimed the correct number of exemptions with his employer for withholding purposes and he became entitled to a tax refund check of $251.00 because the withholding was based on the premise that he would be employed for the entire year.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.108" offset="733205">Thus, when Mr. Kokoszka filed his bankruptcy in 1972, his tax refund check, like the vacation pay in Lines was entirely accrued and earned at the time of bankruptcy and it was the result of prebankruptcy labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.897" offset="808333">In Lines, this Court specifically stated that the definition of property cannot be resolved by reference to such questions as the time of vesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.763" offset="851801">Instead, the Court emphasized that more traditional test, as in Segal versus Rochelle that property should be defined by reference to the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.320" offset="902060">In this regard, the Court must analyze the relationship of the asset in question to the debtor’s fresh start and a possible entanglement of the asset in a debtor’s prebankruptcy past.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.150" offset="957336">Utilizing this analysis in the Lines case, certain important factors were present, which resulted in that decision and those same factors are present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.046" offset="1008953">For example, the tax refund check does not represent an investment or savings account, or some other voluntary form of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.496" offset="1054720">It is entirely the result of involuntary actions as the result of the withholding laws of the United States, as vacation pay --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="255.840" offset="1100069">(Inaudible) number of exemptions as a Voluntary Act, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_r_adams" startTime="262.666" stopTime="277.402">
            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Adams</label>
            <text syncTime="262.666" offset="1127445">Yes, the designation of it, but he claimed the proper number of exemptions as he should do under the law, in order to approximately end up with either no tax refund check or no tax is due at the end of the year.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="277.402" stopTime="287.696">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="277.402" offset="1186377">Would the case be different in your estimation had he claimed, as he has a privilege of doing a number of exemptions that do not coincide with the facts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_r_adams" startTime="287.696" stopTime="866.813">
            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Adams</label>
            <text syncTime="287.696" offset="1227546">Yes, I do think the case would be different, because in that case, for example, if he had not claimed as many exemptions as we he was entitled to, the funding question would be similar to a savings account, he would have created a greater tax refund check.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.766" offset="1299853">Now, in the -- one of the cases that’s discussed this issue, the Cedor case, the opinion of the Judge in the Northern District of California, specifically held that because that part of the tax refund check was a result of voluntary activity, that it should be regarded as property under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.184" offset="1377489">In this case, we’re dealing with the tax refund check that was result of no particular voluntary action by the bankrupt, except that he was just complying with the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.932" offset="1428480">Another important aspect of this asset, an important aspect that was also present in Lines is that the tax refund check is not received until after the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.656" offset="1475396">It is a postbankruptcy event, part of the debtor’s future.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.901" offset="1492323">Like vacation pay, it is not particularly reachable or payable to the bankrupt, until the time that it is actually received.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.210" offset="1529626">In Mr. Kokoszka’s case, he filed his bankruptcy on January 5, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.697" offset="1559510">He filed his income tax return in February and he received his tax refund check about two months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.459" offset="1590544">Thus, vacation pay, like the tax refund check importantly is a postbankruptcy event, and part of the debtor’s future, but perhaps the most important aspect of the Lines case is that vacation pay was entirely wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.846" offset="1668180">In this case, similarly the tax refund check here is derived entirely from wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.144" offset="1697332">It consists entirely of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.858" offset="1708199">The bankrupt has been compelled to accept the delayed receipt of wages, which he otherwise would have received, as a result of the withholding laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.021" offset="1756787">But, for the withholding laws, this money would have been available for his use and he would have used it for his support at the time of his regular pay check.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.228" offset="1797642">The Ninth Circuit’s decision, the Cedor case and the Eighth Circuit decision, the Gehrig case focused on the practical realities of the importance of wages to a bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.990" offset="1852709">A bankruptcy, as we point out in our brief and as those courts referred to is frequently a last resort for a debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.844" offset="1884160">He has used up all his assets by the time he’s forced to go into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.194" offset="1905476">He depends entirely on his receipt of future wages, in order to make his fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.995" offset="1932748">In Mr. Kokoszka’s case, he earned only $2,400.00 in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.425" offset="1962423">At that level of earning, all of the person’s wages are necessary for items of immediate support and consumption, as this Court noted in the case of James versus Strange.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.802" offset="2011951">Additionally, Lines was a confluence of streams of decisional law, both in the Bankruptcy Act and outside of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.467" offset="2050612">In Lines, the Court quoted and emphasized its holding in Sniadach that wages were specialized kind of property in our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.211" offset="2093558">Both the Cedor Court and the Gehrig Court felt that given the specialized nature of wages and a condition of the bankrupt that to deprive the bankrupt of his tax refund check would work in equivalent hardship as to deprive him of his vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.712" offset="2171611">Perhaps the more so, because the debtor has already been forced to accept the delayed payment of these wages, which he needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.990" offset="2208705">In any event, the contention of the bankrupt in this case is that the tax refund check is as important a part of the family budget, as vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.284" offset="2253845">Now, the Court below, the Second Circuit did not apply this same analysis and attempted to distinguish Lines versus Frederick in this regard, by claiming that vacation pay was a periodic wage payment, like a person’s regular pay check, whereas this is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.358" offset="2334198">That Court’s distinction, we submit, is both unrealistic and not in keeping with this Court’s decision in the Lines case.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.840" offset="2372127">It is unrealistic because a debtor needs his wages for support, whether they are paid to him on a regular basis or not, they are just as important for his fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.953" offset="2428552">The Second Circuit’s distinction is not consistent with Lines versus Frederick, because in Lines this Court rejected focusing on technical distinctions, such as whether or not the property was paid in a periodic way or not and focused instead on a broader examination and the practical realities to the bankrupt and the relationship of the asset to the debtor’s fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.945" offset="2536490">Another important case, cited by the Court below was Segal versus Rochelle.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.032" offset="2560836">That brings us to the question of whether or not this asset is in some way entangled in the debtor’s prebankruptcy past.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.584" offset="2595109">The second test, which this Court has emphasized, a bankrupt’s position in this case is that Segal versus Rochelle does not require result contrary to what the bankrupt is urging.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.101" offset="2645159">In that case, we dealt with the business bankrupt, who is entitled to receive a loss carry back refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.128" offset="2673267">As this Court noted in Lines, Segal really wasn’t a fresh start case.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.211" offset="2693642">In Segal, a business has ceased to operate, and the job of the trustee was simply to marshal the assets for the benefit of the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.454" offset="2734602">Also, there is not causal link to the prebankruptcy past in this case, as the Court found important in the case of Segal versus Rochelle.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.515" offset="2774831">There, the Court noted the peculiar nature of a loss carry back refund check and found that it was the result of those very losses, which had precipitated the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.006" offset="2828748">There is no such problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.822" offset="2840033">Thus, to summarize this part of the bankrupt’s position, we contend that Lines requires the Court in examining the definition of the meaning of the word “property” focus on practical realities and to analyze the relationship of the asset to the debtor’s fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.566" offset="2926968">Lines marked the rejection of more mechanical approach to defining property, by focusing on whether or not when it was earned, when it was accrued, whether it was a result of prebankruptcy labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.974" offset="2976601">Instead, Lines focused on the relationship of the asset to the debtor’s fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.673" offset="3003455">The fact that it was not an investment or other kind of voluntary creation that it was a postbankruptcy event and that it was inconsistent entirely of wages, which traditionally are the only means for bankrupt to achieve his fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.190" offset="3077538">Thus in Lines, this Court held that the wages represented by vacation pay were essential to a debtor’s fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.196" offset="3113482">Seven months later, in Perez versus Campbell, the Court also held that a debtor shouldn’t be deprived of his driver’s license because of the burden that that would place on his earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.329" offset="3166041">The position of the bankrupt in this case is that the tax refund check, being wages, the loss of a tax refund check would be as serious of a burden on a debtor’s fresh start, as the loss of vacation pay, or the loss of a driver’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.016" offset="3244826">The second issue in this case is whether or not the Federal Wage Exemption Statute, the Consumer Credit Protection Act exempts 75% of the tax refund check.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.460" offset="3290593">The Court need not reach this issue if it rules in the bankrupt’s favor on the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.775" offset="3319850">However, we contend that the CCPA should apply by the terms of the Bankruptcy Act, by terms of the CCPA for an independent policy reason and that -- by reference to administrative materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.491" offset="3386723">First the Bankruptcy Act, many exemption statutes, state exemption statutes do not ever refer to bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.625" offset="3419220">They are not written particularly with bankruptcy in mind, but they apply to a person who goes bankrupt because the Bankruptcy Act requires that they apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.218" offset="3461642">It specifically stated in Section 6 that the bankrupt be allowed all states and federal exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.971" offset="3492676">The CCPA, being a partial, federal wage exemption statute should apply to bankruptcy by the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act in Section 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.926" offset="4076460">Yes, it was two to one, that’s right, excuse me Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.004" offset="4096731">Let me just -- although the Lines issue is often thought to be the main issue in this case as Mr. Justice Blackmun just referred to it, the value to the bankrupt of the application of the 75% Federal Exemption Statute is an important right, which we are seriously urging before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.273" offset="4193802">Well, I was saying a number of state exemptions statutes apply not because in their own terms they refer it all to application in bankruptcy or because of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.300" offset="4237897">In the CCPA, we have a slightly different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.597" offset="4251167">It should apply in a bankruptcy context not only on account of Bankruptcy Act, but on account of its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.855" offset="4280216">Congress specifically stated that the CCPA was passed in order to achieve the uniform application of the bankruptcy loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.545" offset="4314906">In this case, a uniform wage exemption statute rather than the widely varying wage exemption statutes which apply in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.044" offset="4364957">Most of the criticism in the CCPA, both by the Court below, by the Gehrig Court and by opposing counsel has been an attempt to narrow the meaning and the terms of the CCPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.002" offset="4412709">The examination of that statute however shows that it is a broad statute, very broadly drafted by Congress, and additionally being a remedial statute, it is entitled to be liberally construed in favor of achieving its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.441" offset="4478537">Thirdly, there is a policy ground for the application of the CCPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.815" offset="4495987">This was noted by the District Court in the Cedor case, involving a question of fairness that creditors, the exemption should not be defeated and creditors should not be allowed to get the entire tax refund check merely because the debtor has been forced to accept the delayed receipt of that money due to the operation of the withholding laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.881" offset="4596297">Finally in this regard, there are number of administrative materials, which are cited in our brief, which support our position, our interpretation of this Act and its application of this situation and those administrative materials are entitled a great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.126" offset="4661290">In conclusion, an examination of the relationship of this asset to the debtor’s fresh start in the same practical way this Court made that analysis in Lines should yield a result that a wage earner’s postbankruptcy receipt of his tax refund check is not property within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.176" offset="4749479">As far as the Federal Wage Exemption Statute is concerned, it should apply here by the terms of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.368" offset="4778214">It should apply by the terms of the CCPA or an independent policy reason, and by reference to supporting administrative materials.</text>

          <turn speaker="benjamin_r_civiletti" startTime="1194.721" stopTime="1997.468">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin R. Civiletti</label>
            <text syncTime="1194.721" offset="4855641">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.277" offset="4869851">We are dealing here with a tax refund claim, which at the time of the petition in bankruptcy was fixed and certain as to amount and demandable and collectible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.798" offset="4923977">The argument made by the petitioner is that a wage earner’s bankrupt’s tax refund claim is not property because it is necessary to his fresh start, I think runs counter to the meaning and the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act, its historical development and interpretation, and specifically conflicts with the pertinent parts of the definitional sections of the Act, under Section 70a (5) and under Section 6 of Exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.164" offset="5049365">Furthermore, the petitioner’s argument misinterprets, I believe, the concept of a fresh start and the rationale of the petitioner’s position would impose substantial confusion and uncertainty in the Bankruptcy Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.727" offset="5111641">First, the scheme of the Bankruptcy Law generally is in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.648" offset="5131389">First, marshaling the assets at the time of the filing of the petition, all the property of the bankrupt vest by operable with certain exceptions, which is not nonexempt, vest by operation of law in the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.604" offset="5195128">The second part of that scheme is Section 6, the exemption part, which provides specifically that local conditions shall govern local statutes, which assets maybe maintained by the particular bankrupt in order to assure that he can survive and so that he can have at least those basic essential requirements in which he can then cause to begin his new life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.130" offset="5329293">The concept of a fresh start incorporates both those ideas of assets to the trustee and exemptions to the bankrupt and also, and most importantly the idea provided by Section 17 of a discharge, an effective valuable discharge to the bankrupt, so that he can begin his new economic life, free of the burden of these preexisting debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.464" offset="5474638">So that the three elements, I suggest for a fresh start, are: (1) the proper discharge; (2) specified assets or items of value, which provide a base and an opportunity to start anew, provided by exemptions; and (3) the opportunity and the safeguard that future earnings and after acquired property can be used, retained, and accumulated by the bankrupt in his new economic effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.063" offset="5593025">The petitioner twists and distorts the traditional concept of fresh start into the overriding proposition that the Bankruptcy Law must provide, it seems to me, a protected fund sufficient to meet the needs of the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.399" offset="5674318">The primary support suggested by the petitioner in his argument and his brief, is the case of Lines v. Frederick decided in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.595" offset="5711099">There in essence, the question was presented whether the credits are accrued or pay accrued during prebankruptcy work for vacation and layoff time periods to come about in the future, after the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, were property within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.703" offset="5787585">This Court determined that whatever characteristics of property for other purposes that those credits are accrued pay might have or possessed, they were overshadowed in comparison to their similarity, the future earnings and the purposes of the act, as embodied in the term “fresh start.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.583" offset="5871073">The similarities of the accruals to future wages were one the fact that the accrued credits or pay were not payable and collectible on demand by the petitioner at the time of the filing of his petition at all, but would ordinarily be payable at the future event, vacation or layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.947" offset="5944529">In fact, the accrued pay or credits were designed and specifically tied to one of the other of those two events as a substitute payment for future period of time, which but for vacation or layoff would be working time and which the bankrupt would receive the very weekly earnings, which would be cause to sustain him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.437" offset="6026449">The only relation back at all of the accrued credits or the pay, the vacation pay to the prebankruptcy past was at the prior regular working period was the basis for accumulating the accrual on a percentage formula, as to hours or days and it’s equivalent in money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.723" offset="6119654">I believe it was one hour per month or one hour per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.737" offset="6139716">It is readily apparent that here, if the facts are entirely different from those crucial determinations there which made accrued vacation pay look like and be treated the same as future wages, which indeed are protected and should be protected both by the discharge and by the concept of fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.224" offset="6241593">One, the tax refund claim here is fixed and certain as to amount, demandable and collectible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.030" offset="6272836">Two, there is no design, no specification or intent to relate or identify the accumulation of periodic payments, required as withholding for expected tax liability and which constitutes a reason for the refund claim to any period of future working time or as a substitute for regular earnings as sustenance to the wage earner in the event of future loss time for layoff, vacation leaves, sick leave, or any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.008" offset="6392790">The tax refund claim is simply not the equivalent to future wages or a substitute for future wages during the suspended working period in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.215" offset="6433646">Lastly, it seems to me that all the characteristics of the tax refund claim relate back to the prebankruptcy past, during the very accumulation of debt, which resulted in the filing of the petition of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.726" offset="6507624">In this regard, I think it is speculation to suggest, as perhaps the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have suggested, in the case of in re Gehrig and in re Cedor that the wage earner would not have used the amounts periodically withheld for the payments of debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.770" offset="6571781">Certainly, they are small amounts and they would not have made a tremendous impact on the debts at the time of proceeding, but it is certain and probable that they would have been spent and they would have been spent either to reduce in part the debts or prevent the further accumulation of debt for expenses incurred at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.700" offset="6651507">And thus, it seems to me that they relate to the very part of the period, which created the debt and necessitated bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.870" offset="6696229">The further argument is made by the Ninth Circuit’s adoption of this recorded opinion, in an effort to bring the tax refund closer within the Lines the Frederick case that the amount of a tax refund may be generally be said to be an amount that by reason of past experience is anticipated by the wage earner as an annual event, i.e. the vacation pay and the potential layoff, and that to deprive the wage earner of that planned on annual recurring payment cannot be said to be less severe than the deprivation of two weeks paid vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.244" offset="6873757">It seems to me that statement, that type of analogy, not only being somewhat illogical is a further distinction between the tax refund claim and accrued vacation pay or credit because in the ordinary course of events and if the taxpayer follows the withholding guidelines properly, although vacation pay is indeed paid and received in the future by a wage earner as an annual event, the minimum payment of income on taxes withheld periodically during the year and accumulated over the course of the year is not calculated, nor anticipated to be repaid as an annual event to the taxpayer, rather its intended, designed, and anticipated to be paid and retained by the Government, as the wage earner’s income tax on those earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.475" offset="7094648">It seems to me that in fact to its essence, the petitioner’s argument is that because the tax refund claim had has its origins in withheld payments from wages, the refund is wages and because the debtor has not collected the refund at the time of the filing of the petition, although he had right to do so, it is somehow future wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.056" offset="7201019">The petitioner’s argument amounts to ignoring the definition of property in Section 70a (5), ignoring the definition and design of exemptions, I think ignoring the traditional concept of “fresh start” and the entire fabric of the Bankruptcy Act, in adopting a new and controlling rationale for inclusion or exclusion of items of value in the debtor’s estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.587" offset="7299135">And to base that decision entirely in a wage earner’s case on a determination of the amount of a fund, free of creditors and necessary are sufficient to meet the bankrupt’s needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.999" offset="7352738">I don’t think that this rationale has any place in this Court’s decision on the existing and statutory case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.153" offset="7389309">If there is to be such a change and such a drastic one, then certainly the legislature and the Congress should mandate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.733" offset="7427657">And, in fact the commission on the bankruptcy laws of the United States has reported to the Congress, as of July 30, 1973 proposing substantial revisions in the Bankruptcy Law and proposing that as to this particular issue, under a provision with regard to exemptions that income tax refunds, accrued vacation pay, receivables, cash and securities be considered to be exempt in the aggregate of not more than $500.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.934" offset="7580526">But the standard proposed by the petitioner is unsound and its application would result, it seems to me, in severe discrimination between bankrupts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.135" offset="7621277">One bankrupt may indeed need $75.00 for medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.721" offset="7635592">The second $500.00 for his wife’s operation, and the third $2,000.00 for the tuition for his children’s education, all certainly are legitimate and valid needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.483" offset="7682717">But in no sense can it be said that such a standard would achieve the purposes of the Act nor that the tax refund claim in varying amounts, which in some instances may amount to in excess of a $1,000.00 would serve these varying purposes or needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.517" offset="7778847">There is a suggestion in the brief that because the amount of a tax refund in this case is small, and because administration costs and expenses are significant in some instances that very little of this amount of money will trickle down to the creditors and therefore, wouldn’t it be better to give it to the needy bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.677" offset="7887412">The answer to that, I think comes in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.928" offset="7912490">One, administration costs and expenses are not necessarily evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.916" offset="7936418">They are in the Act and they are in fact, under Section 64, given first priority with regard to payments from the assets accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.675" offset="7975497">Secondly, there is no support in the record in this case that the $250.90 would be exhausted by administrative costs and expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.613" offset="8015203">And in other cases where the refund may be substantially greater, there is no suggestion that such administrative costs and expenses will even substantially beat it into the assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.251" offset="8109767">I think that is correct, especially in a wage earner’s case, because it seems to me that in one route or another, one either direct or indirect all of the property or all assets are derived from his only source, which is wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.739" offset="8207673">I think the Brookings study showed that in 70% of the cases, there were no asset cases at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.630" offset="8239229">Third, if as the petitioner points out on page 16 of his brief, a survey indicates that the average dividend to unsecured creditors is only 7%, then that alone does not seem to me a justification to further reduce the percentage on one of the basic designs of the Act to return money to the creditors, from 7% closer to zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.163" offset="8337450">Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly and I think it occurs in varying degrees, in varying in districts and jurisdictions, abandonment is available, where appropriate in such small asset cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.076" offset="8397009">I think the California cases suggest that some of the referees there and the District Courts there have adopted the policy of -- if the refund claim is the only asset and it’s less than $150.00, that they would treat it as abandonment, as a no asset case and no trustee would be appointed and the $10.00 will be even saved in the cost of the bankrupt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.030" offset="9832908">I would think that is a fair conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.690" offset="9851507">My argument has proceeded along the lines that there is no legitimate distinction between the principles applicable to this case and those past cases concerning properties, Segal v. Rochelle and the antecedent cases, Legg v. St. John and in mind, the concept of “fresh start” Local Loan v. Hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.355" offset="9946175">The Segal case, I suggest was a more difficult case than the one presented here because the petitioners had filed for bankruptcy before the end of the tax year, and thus any refund was demandable nor collectible immediately nor at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, nor was the amount there of fixed, nor truly determinable with the exact certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.770" offset="10039798">Furthermore, the carry back tax loss resulted in a tax refund, which the trustee was found entitled to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.079" offset="10069055">Even though the tax was paid, it had been paid from the individual earnings of the bankrupt taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.375" offset="10102282">There was no suggestion in that case, in the opinion in that case by this Court that the amounts in Segal respectively of $283.00 and $1,600.00 for Gerald Segal in the carry back years of 1960 and 1959 and like amounts for Sam Segal could not have been well used by them in obtaining the necessary fresh start in their new economic life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.818" offset="10208026">The Court took, I suggest, pains to emphasize the lost carry back claim there was sufficiently rooted in the prebankruptcy past and so little entangle with the bankruptcy to make unencumbered fresh start that it should be regarded as the property under Section 70 (a) (5), despite the substantial differences, which I suggest make this case considerably easier in determination of the question of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.162" offset="10317427">The tax refund claim is fixed and certain as to amount demandable and collectible at the time of the filing of petition and I suggest has no relationship to future wages nor after acquired property, both of which elements were certainly controlling in the Lines case and had some effect in the Segal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.608" offset="10411154">A decision upholding the Second Circuit and the trustee would not only be consistent with Lines v. Frederick, but would further serve to confirm the plain meaning and intent of the principles recognized so clearly in the case, future wages and after acquired property are necessary, essential elements of the concept of a fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.743" offset="10499762">There is no legitimate distinction, I suggest between a tax refund claim and any other moneys or funds obtained by payroll withholding from past wages pursuant to a savings plan, a Christmas club, a bond the month plan, a retail lay away plan, an educational loan repayment plan, or agreement, union dues, auto insurance, real estate tax or any other established payroll deduction, which could result in a refund or repayment from a second or third source.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.960" offset="10688575">I think that they would argue that that is a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.950" offset="10700591">I suggest that number one, the meaning of voluntary varies, depending on its application and that pursuant to a loan agreement for instance, once the decision is made, then that payment or deduction from payroll might well no longer be considered to be voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.741" offset="10771749">Similarly here, as Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out, the voluntariness to some extent is available to the taxpayer in the manner in which he proscribes his withholding and it is adjustable during the course of the year, depending on changes and circumstances by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.537" offset="10862864">Turning to the Consumer Credit Protection Act, my argument there is a very short and brief one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.163" offset="10893375">It is not applicable, because the tax refund claim here does not come within the definitional term of earnings in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.195" offset="10937574">It is not compensation paid or payable for past services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.597" offset="10955128">It does not come within the definition of the term disposable earnings, because it is not that part of earnings remaining after deductions allowed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.981" offset="10996715">And lastly, it is not within the term the definition of garnishment, which in the language of the statute means any legal or equitable procedure through which the earnings of any individual are required to be withheld for the payment of any debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.229" offset="11073620">Here, if this is property then it vests in the trustee by operation of law and it is not required to be withheld for the payment of any debt pursuant for instance, to provisions of seizure or collection under Section 70 (c) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.500" offset="11150733">The reference in the Consumer Credit Protection Act, specific reference in that Act, Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Act and saying that the provisions of the Consumer Credit Protection Act do not apply to Chapter 13 arrangements was made because Chapter 13 arrangements do apply to future wages, do specifically provide for the deduction for the payment to creditors for past debts, pursuant to the plan approved by the referee, and therefore, was necessary in order to make clear that the 25% limitation would not apply to such arrangements that Chapter 13 should be specifically referred in the Consumer Credit Protection Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.939" offset="11596487">And as this Court found in Lines versus Frederick, wages are special kind of asset in our system.</text>
