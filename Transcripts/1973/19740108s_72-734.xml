            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">Thank you, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2.296" offset="85891">The judgments and opinions of the Court in 72-734, United States against Calandra and 72-782, Gateway Coal Co. against United Mine Workers, will each be announced by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="18.683" offset="151510">The respondent in number 72-734 was called to testify before a Grand Jury investigating the loansharking activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.880" offset="196232">His place of business had previously been searched under a warrant, directed solely to an evidence in bookmaking activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.644" offset="235311">In that search, evidence as to loansharking was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.375" offset="254224">The warrant was not broad enough to encompass such evidence and accordingly its seizure was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.888" offset="284317">On respondent's motion the District Court ordered suppression of this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.790" offset="311902">It further held that respondent need not answer any of the Grand Jury's questions based on the suppressed evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.142" offset="345339">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.872" offset="360281">The case is here on the Government's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.184" offset="381492">The exclusionary rule, a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights is applicable in criminal trials to suppress illegally seized evidence and the fruits thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.459" offset="458606">The question in this case is whether the exclusionary rule applies also to a Grand Jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.616" offset="491207">We hold that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.042" offset="500924">The rule does not proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence, in all proceedings or against persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.394" offset="534361">Its application has been restricted to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.883" offset="576261">Extending the rule to Grand Jury investigations would at most achieve only a speculative advance in the deterrence of police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.383" offset="626312">More importantly such an extension would unduly interfere with the effective and expeditious discharge of the Grand Jury's duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.640" offset="667272">The public has a substantial interest in preserving the historic role and functions of the Grand Jury, without burdening it with what this Court has described in a recent case as mini trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.406" offset="730384">It is to be remembered of course that a witness called by the Grand Jury may protect his own position by invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.284" offset="785868">Indeed in this case, respondent had been offered transactional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.996" offset="812722">Mr, Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
