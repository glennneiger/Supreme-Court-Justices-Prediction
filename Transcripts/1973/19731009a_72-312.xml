            <text syncTime="32.085" offset="205113">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.853" offset="220160">With the permission of the court, I would like to save my last 10 minutes for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.367" offset="242207">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the First Appellate District of the Court Of Appeal Of California which is our intermediate Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.336" offset="286093">It is an action for declaratory relief and damages which was brought in the California Superior Court by Mr. Ware on behalf of himself and others alleging that a forfeiture provision in a profit sharing plan violated by California Law and is unenforcible.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.420" offset="370416">Merrill Lynch answered and petitioned for arbitration and it did so because it had agreed with Merrill Lynch, with Ware, that any and all disputes arising out of his employment would be arbitrated in accordance with the rules of New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.074" offset="461009">The Judge in the Superior Court denied the petition without findings and he was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.579" offset="519105">Not withstanding the fact that four months prior, the very same court had held under identical facts that Merrill Lynch had the right to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.189" offset="565499">Now that case is the Ware case which we have included in our Appendix and to which I shall make further reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.457" offset="614609">Merrill Lynch then petitioned the Supreme Court of California to review these two conflicting decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.642" offset="643344">The Supreme Court denied it and we came here to ascertain whether or not there isn't a federal interest in maintaining the uniform application of these New York Stock Exchange rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.523" offset="726831">Now the pertinent facts are few and they can be stated simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.248" offset="757760">Ware was employed as an Account Executive at Merrill Lynch in July 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.446" offset="794540">Merrill Lynch is a member of the New York Stock Exchange and as such it is required to abide by its rules which include the fact that all account executives must be registered representatives of the Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.091" offset="869146">Now, to become a registered representative of the Stock Exchange, it is necessary for the applicant to undergo a rigorous 26 week training course to pass an examination with respect to both his competence and his integrity and then he must agree to abide by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.306" offset="985966">The rules requiring are set forth in the appendix to our brief, Rule 345 and the rules governing arbitration, Rule 347 is on page 9 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.669" offset="1059422">Mr. Ware did exactly this.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.114" offset="1069244">He took the course, he passed and he signed an agreement to abide by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.141" offset="1565362">The plan has several other very important provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.696" offset="1595559">In Section 22.1, it provides that it shall be interpreted under the laws of New York and in Article 11.1 which brings about the instant lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.397" offset="1670374">It provides that an employee voluntarily terminates his employment with Merrill Lynch and goes to work for a competitor that his rights and benefits under the plan, maybe declared forfeit.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.558" offset="1770998">Now to join the plan Mr. Ware had to agree that the conditions of the plan and this he did, his second agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.766" offset="1811853">Mr. Orrick, why is it important in your argument that the contract provider should be interpreted according to the laws of New York?</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Orrick, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="442.436" offset="1846544">Because what appeared to be the gravamen of Mr. Ware's action, namely, that the Business and Professions Code Section 16,600, made this forfeiture clause invalid, and therefore the choice of law -- therefore that created a strong public policy in California which would outlaw the choice of law provision, I don't know if I make myself.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.709" offset="1995546">I don't see what are the arguments you make here about in effect Federal preemption, if they didn't prevail as you make them, why it would make it improper for California as a matter of public policy to reject New York law?</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Orrick, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="496.965" offset="2064614">Well, I haven't said that, Your Honor, except that I want to make this point, the California statute which is Business and Professions Code 16,600, provides every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.980" offset="2188643">That's what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.682" offset="2195435">Now the Supreme Court in this Muggill v. Reuben H. Donnelley, held that the application of that statute to a provision in a plan that was similar to this, would render this forfeiture clause, unenforceable in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.340" offset="2290103">However, that statute doesn't mean what it says, because the Supreme Court of California in another case, Gordan against Wandell has said that statute will not apply in a situation where there are trade secrets or customers lists or things of that nature involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.402" offset="2374322">That is, what we can fairly -- we think show here, if we get to arbitration, what we are asking here is our right to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.316" offset="2421969">We have an agreement to arbitrate with Mr. Ware which is under the Federal Arbitration Act and under the State Arbitrate Act, a valid, irrevocable and enforceable.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.815" offset="2528026">Because the California Court of Appeal ruled against it?</text>

            <text syncTime="617.416" offset="2546416">Yeah, that's why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.920" offset="2556447">We think it's clearly enforceable under the State Arbitration Act as it is under the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.842" offset="2584137">And we think that otherwise, it would be a forum shopping as the Chief Judge Foll dealt with the (Inaudible) DeBerry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.252" offset="2645786">But we are entitled to it under that, in addition Mr. Justice we are entitled to it under the New York Stock Exchange rules particularly 347B.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.568" offset="2698971">Now these rules were promulgated pursuant to Section 6C of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and they are in this industry, the only industry of its kind where this court has referred to it as federally mandated self-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.735" offset="2795729">Arbitration is a very important part of that self-regulation and we have here a situation involving inter-state commerce and we have here a situation involving the question whether these rules, the New York Stock exchange will be uniformly applied, if we are in New York, for example, there's perfectly clear that there would be arbitration under the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.810" offset="2919967">So we think that we are entitled to arbitrate and entitled both under the Federal statute and under the rules of the Stock Exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.421" offset="3234482">If some other state that attempts to invalidate what is consistent with New York law, the Federal law prevents.</text>
