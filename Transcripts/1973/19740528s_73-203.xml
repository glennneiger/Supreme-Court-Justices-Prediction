            <text syncTime="13.208" offset="129567">This case, here on certiorari from the Second Circuit, involves a complex class action suit, brought under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.683" offset="187455">The petitioner suing on behalf of himself and other odd-lot traders on the New York Stock Exchange charge respondent brokerage firms with violations of antitrust and securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.695" offset="251507">The prospective class was extremely large, including some six million purchasers and sellers of odd-lot shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.267" offset="293825">More than two million of these could be identified by name and address.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.519" offset="314828">It was estimated that it would cost $225,000 to send notices to each of these identified parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.014" offset="356833">The District Court, holding that individual notice was not required, had proved a plan for notice to be sent only to a limited number of the class and for notice by publication being directed to the remainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.424" offset="422452">This form of notice would cause about $22,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.393" offset="442305">The Court of Appeals reversed disapproving among other things, this limited and incomplete notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.818" offset="476056">We agree with the Court of Appeals on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.136" offset="493296">Rule 23 (C) (2) requires and here, I quote that the best notice practicable under the circumstances including individual notice to all members of the class who can be identified through reasonable effort, unless be sent such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.575" offset="575007">We think the import of this language is unmistakable.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.407" offset="590367">The District Courtâ€™s plan for selected notice plus publication simply does not comply with the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.830" offset="628088">We remand the case with instructions to dismiss the class action unless a smaller class is defined and petitioner is willing to pay for notice to the numbers there of.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.595" offset="687125">Mr. Justice Douglas filed an opinion dissenting in thought, in which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall joined.</text>
