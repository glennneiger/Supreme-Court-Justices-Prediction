            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">Number 72-1517 is Gilmore against the City Of Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.827" offset="112013">This case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.936" offset="132493">It is but another chapter in prolong litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.359" offset="150152">The lawsuit began in 1958 when the petitioners who are Negro citizens of Montgomery, sued to desegregate the city’s public parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.221" offset="193620">They were successful and the District Court ordered the parks desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.812" offset="212010">Thereafter, however, segregated recreational programs were developed by the city in cooperation with the local YMCA and recreational facilities in Negro neighborhoods were not maintained equally with others.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.962" offset="268643">The petitioners accordingly in 1970 moved to reopen the litigation based on the facts developed in a separate action, involving the YMCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.681" offset="307513">Those claims were settled by agreement, but then, however in 1971, the petitioners moved for further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.786" offset="343876">They complained that the city was permitting segregated schools and segregated private groups and clubs to use city parks and recreational facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.088" offset="385149">The District Court enjoined the city from permitting the use of Municipal Recreational facilities by any racially segregated private school or group, or by any non-school group or club that had a discriminatory admissions policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.030" offset="456829">On appeal, the Fifth Circuit sustained the injunction with respect to what it called exclusive use by segregated schools, but reversed insofar as the injunction applied to nonexclusive use by segregated schools and to any use by non-school groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.444" offset="534570">We affirm in part and reverse in part and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.998" offset="560692">We hold that the city was properly enjoined from permitting exclusive access to its recreational facilities by segregated private schools and by groups affiliated with such schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.185" offset="613460">We reason as to this that the city’s policies contravene an outstanding school desegregation court order intended to perpetuate a dual school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.719" offset="659644">The majority of the Court, however, feel that on this record, it is not possible to determine whether nonexclusive use by private school groups in common with others and by non-school groups involve the city so directly in the actions of those users as to warrant court intervention on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.397" offset="746371">I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a separate concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.402" offset="782315">Mr. Justice White has filed a separate concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas joins and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
