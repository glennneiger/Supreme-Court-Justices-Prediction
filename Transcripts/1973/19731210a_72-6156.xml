            <text syncTime="39.728" offset="235624">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.367" offset="254224">I believe this Court is familiar with this case as the second time here.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.806" offset="271987">We’d like to emphasize very briefly a few of the facts though.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.927" offset="288496">The situation is -- typifies a sort of situation that probably repeats itself everyday in the urbanized parts of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.785" offset="323918">The defendant, Mallie Lewis was upset about some particular police conduct directed towards her son, Joseph.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.081" offset="353071">She failed to get satisfactory answers from the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.432" offset="366446">Upon the advice of the police, she followed the police patrol car carrying her son in the Central Lockup in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.420" offset="394449">Now, the police patrol car seeing that it was being -- that he was being followed eventually pulled over the appellant apparently to find out why she was following him.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.467" offset="442619">The appellant got out of the car, protested again her treatment by the police and the failure to explain to her what was being done with her son.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.398" offset="482325">And at that point, according to the police testimony said, “You god damn M. F. police, I am going to Giarrusso about this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="109.978" offset="516702">I think the part, “I am going to Giarrusso about this,” should not be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.409" offset="534361">Giarrusso is the Superintendent of Police in New Orleans, a high public official and a comment by Mallie Lewis reflects an intention to complain as an expression of some First Amendment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.089" offset="593084">The ultimate issue in the case is one of the limits of protest and expression of anger by a citizen who feels aggrieved by police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.698" offset="639582">Statute under which Mallie Lewis was convicted provides that, it shall be unlawful and a breach of the peace for any person wantonly to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward all with reference to any member of the city police while in the actual performance of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.877" offset="712307">When this case was last before the Court, that ordinance had never been the subject of any sort of construction and had been upheld all the way along the line on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.127" offset="757238">It had never in fact received any recent consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.247" offset="773747">In light of this Court’s vacating the original judgment and the remand of the Supreme Court of Louisiana has once again affirmed the appellant’s conviction this time with an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.875" offset="832261">The position of the appellant that the opinion below of the Louisiana Supreme Court is not a narrowing construction of the ordinance, that it does not resolve the constitutional problems and that it leaves punishable language, which is merely opprobrious, language that this Court held in Gooding versus Wilson cannot be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.960" offset="912614">I think the point that most clearly emphasizes this is the provision in the statute that the language need not only be spoken towards the police but maybe spoken merely with reference to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.687" offset="963500">This issue was raised right from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.567" offset="978965">The problem with in reference to the police, the problem of statements made out of the hearing of the particular police officer spoken about.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.333" offset="1014073">It’s an obvious -- an apparently obvious defect in an ordinance that might otherwise be made applicable to fighting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.347" offset="1042181">But nowhere does the opinion of the Louisiana Supreme Court below address that issue and yet it was very clearly before the Court the dissent, picked it up at great length below but the majority ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.423" offset="1110413">And I submit that what the majority did below was justified that ordinance on its face which cannot be done under this Court’s holding in Gooding.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.609" offset="1159210">Now admittedly, the court below does refer to fighting words on a couple of occasions in its opinions but it never articulates what the fighting words standard means.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.581" offset="1211037">Whether it is the dictum of Chaplinsky that fighting words of those which are likely to provoke violence or the mere utterance of which inflicts injury or the holding of Chaplinsky and the holding of Gooding that the only language punishable is that which is likely to provoke a violent response.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.813" offset="1295987">I think what the Louisiana Supreme Court did below is similar to what the California Courts had done with the ordinance involved in Cohen versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.422" offset="1342485">And in that case, the late Mr. Justice Harlan noted in the footnote that although the Supreme Court of California had limited the scope of the ordinance to utterances likely to result in violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.154" offset="1393371">It had more or less made a per se holding that all obscene language or epithets of the type uttered by Cohen were in all cases likely to provoke violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.645" offset="1435376">And that’s basically the way the Louisiana Supreme Court below has afforded this Court’s holding in Gooding by simply deciding, okay, all opprobrious and obscene language is fighting words and that is the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.112" offset="1489189">But I think that circumvents this Court’s holding completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.302" offset="1505907">I think an ordinance like this because of the manner in which it is enforced and the courts in which it is enforced presents a good case for the application of the “overbreadth” doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.679" offset="1555435">The ordinance has been on the books in Louisiana and enforced in New Orleans for 77 years but until this past couple of years has not been the subject of any appellate decisions whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.501" offset="1610710">It is not the sort of ordinance that is going to effectively narrowed on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.657" offset="1635370">The whole ordinance is overbroad, it must be thrown out and standard set for how to write a good ordinance, how the legislative authorities in New Orleans can address themselves to the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.527" offset="1698900">There is implicit in the opinion of the Supreme Court below that an ordinance such as this can be justified as opposed to the ordinance involved in Gooding because of the limitation of the ordinance to language spoken of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.037" offset="1772878">I think the interest involved tend to cut the other way and of anything the fact that this ordinance is limited to language spoken of the police suggests that the standard should be even tighter and more rigorous and that this Court should assure that the fighting word standard is not abused in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.073" offset="1861068">I think it is necessary to go back to the facts again because I don’t think it is clear at all that what Mallie Lewis uttered were in fact fighting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.067" offset="1909029">It was an expression of anger.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.261" offset="1921776">Someone might pound their fist in anger or pull a hair in anger or simply if they were a person of great self-control say, “I am angry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="470.533" offset="1958870">The comment was directed at all police generally, not just the police officer there.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.851" offset="1984157">Tied in with it was a statement that I am aggrieved, I am going to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.570" offset="2003069">I do not think Police Officer Berner could legitimately feel that the language addressed to him by Mallie Lewis was intended to provoke him.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.572" offset="2042984">And there is nothing in the record to suggest that Officer Berner was provoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.081" offset="2165029">A police officer is -- the Court I know is familiar with it, the comments on the Model Penal Code is accustomed to language of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.388" offset="2198256">The citizen is not and the police officer deals day to day with situations in which people feel hostile towards it.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.350" offset="2230126">Both the innocent and the guilty being arrested or being accosted or investigated by the police are going to feel aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.251" offset="2261786">The innocent wants to know why it is happening to them and the guilty realizes that the game is up and the people who the police are dealing with, in most circumstances feels some anger towards the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.937" offset="2372545">Let’s say a defendant or a citizen says, “You god damn M. F. police, take off your gun and I’ll show you, who’s the boss.”</text>
            <text syncTime="585.556" offset="2418939">Well, that’s a challenge to the police officer right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.338" offset="2430119">It’s a challenge to his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.915" offset="2436389">It’s a dare “I dare you to do something.”</text>
            <text syncTime="593.139" offset="2449345">The words uttered by Mallie Lewis here aren’t that kind of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.967" offset="2468571">I mean, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, in Cohen, you know that the words uttered by the defendant there were somewhat childish.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.239" offset="2841704">Right, but as I understand the Court’s opinion, it was used as an example of the fact that the Georgia Courts had been applying the ordinance there to situations that did not involve fighting words and at that case was cited as an example in which a jury issue was raised by that utterance.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.606" offset="2915161">And this Court was of the opinion that no jury issue was raised because those were -- while words were opprobrium were not clearly fighting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.111" offset="2949224">And, you know, I would think the average person today might feel that he was less likely to provoke a violent response if he said to a trained police officer in a metropolitan environment, “You are a god damn racketeer.”</text>
