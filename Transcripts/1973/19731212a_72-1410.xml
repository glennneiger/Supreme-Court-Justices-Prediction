            <text syncTime="29.487" offset="194664">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.792" offset="203964">John Jordan, the plaintiff-respondent in this case filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois individually and as representative of a class, seeking an injunctive relief and damages for violation of the federal welfare regulations against former directors of the Illinois Department of Public Aid of the State of Illinois and other county officials charged with administrating the welfare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.510" offset="310753">Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that certain sections under the Illinois Categorical Assistance Manual were invalid, being inconsistent with the 30-day and the 60-day determination requirements as defined by the regulations of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.805" offset="387971">The defendants in this matter denied the allegations, material allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.874" offset="412212">The welfare program involved is the Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled, and is one of the categorical assistance programs that it is administered by the Illinois Department of Public Aid under the Illinois Public Aid Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.465" offset="474593">The program is funded 50% by the state, and the other 50% is provided by the Federal Government under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.429" offset="510433">The Illinois Department of Public Aid issued regulations pursuant to statute setting up eligibility and payment requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.273" offset="541884">And the Department of Health, Education and Welfare which administers the welfare program for the Federal Government promulgated regulations pursuant to the Social Security Act, setting up time limitations for the determination of eligibility and the payments of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.637" offset="611265">The plaintiffs in this action contended that the Illinois Department of Public Aid was required to process all applications for welfare assistance for the aged and the blind within 30 days, and for the disabled within 60 days of the initial application.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.176" offset="677407">Having failed to process such applications within the specified time so plaintiffs contended, the plaintiff class was entitled to monetary award commencing on July 1, 1968 which is the date of the federal regulations went into effect to be computed by the amount of money, the members of the class would have received, had their applications been processed within the 30 and the 60-day requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.951" offset="788584">The defendants never claimed that all such applications were process within the 30 and the 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.302" offset="813976">Indeed, the defendants pointed out that some applications take longer to process than others because of various factors which must be determined in order to establish eligibility for the particular applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.755" offset="863817">The District Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and enter the judgment that provided among other things that the Illinois Department of Public Aid be permanently enjoined from failing to make a determination of eligibility and payment within the 30 days of initial application for aid to the aged and blind, and within 60 days of the initial application for the disabled under the Illinois Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.193" offset="977502">The District Court also found for the plaintiffs on the monetary award question.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.887" offset="996310">It required the defendants to make all payments not made to the applications would apply for the Illinois Department of Public Aid benefits between July 1, 1968, the day that the federal regulation went into effect, and April 16, 1972, the date that the District Court entered a preliminary injunction mandating the Illinois Department of Public Aid to make the payments within the 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.815" offset="1104039">For the aged and the blind applicants who did not receive their initial benefit check within the 30 days from the date of application, the order provided for the payment of a sum of money equal to the assistance they would have received for the period beginning on the 30th day from the date of application for the -- to the date their entitlement became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.691" offset="1195468">For the disabled, they were two different dates because of the fact of the change of the regulations during the course of this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.374" offset="1226292">But in affect, the order provided for the payment of money equal to the assistance they would have received for the period beginning either with the 45th day or the 60th day, depending upon the date of the entitlement or the date of the application to the date that they actually received their first benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.591" offset="1307063">Appeal followed in the Court of Appeals, and this appeal was based substantially on the same grounds that are raised in the instant petition for writ of certiorari to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.099" offset="1353143">In particular, it was pointed out that an action for a monetary award filed against state officials in their official capacity the award to be discharged out of the general revenue fund of the State of Illinois could not be maintained by federal district court in view of the provisions of the Eleventh Amendment to the Unites States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.653" offset="1439347">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this contention and found that a retroactive money award given to welfare recipients did not contravene the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.645" offset="1495353">It is respectfully submitted that a suit seeking payment of a money award from the general revenue fund of a state by class of welfare recipients sounding in equity, whether it be characterized as restitution or damages in within the clear meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, and hence the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and the opinion on mandate of the Seventh Circuit as they apply to the monetary award should be reversed by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.764" offset="2447778">It’s a denial of certiorari, yes sir and there’s arguments on both sides to that question of course, Rothstein versus Wyman which is the Second Circuit Court of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.854" offset="2488216">Many of the jurisdictions hold the fact that this Court did not entertain certiorari in that case such a precedent that the Eleventh Amendment argument is a valid argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.690" offset="2531474">The other side we’ve argued in our case to the fact that the Seventh Circuit has rejected the Eleventh Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.686" offset="2563448">Rothstein versus Wyman is a -- bringing it up as a Second Circuit case which dealt with the same subject matter as this involved here, yet contrary to the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court in this case, the Second Circuit in the Rothstein held that the Eleventh Amendment bargain action in the United States District Court for the release of benefits supposedly wrongfully withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.988" offset="2656653">There the Second Circuit went into a long examination of this Court‘s opinion in Rosado versus Wyman and the fact that pursuant to Rosado versus Wyman, the only remedy afforded by the Social Security Act was the withholding of federal funds from the state and that it was not a personal thing to the welfare recipients, and the Second Circuit held on that basis that there was an improper exercise of equity jurisdiction by the lower court in awarding retroactive benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.104" offset="2789146">The state however in the appeal raised the Eleventh Amendment which provides that a federal judicial power did not extend to suits against the state, and the court in Rothstein versus Wyman held that the point was well taken that insofar as retroactive payments are concern, it is in truth a suit against the State of New York which the State of New York had never consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.507" offset="2890815">The court in the Rothstein case then stated and I quote “It is one thing to tell the Commissioner of Social Services that he must comply with federal standards for the future if the state is to have the benefits of federal funds and the programs he administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.076" offset="2953091">It is quite another thing to where the Commissioner to use funds to make preparation for the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.093" offset="2977123">The latter would appear to us would fall a foul of the Eleventh Amendment if that basic constitutional provision is to be conceive as having any present force”.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.172" offset="3293414">At the recess, I was just indicating to the Court that the thrust of the plaintiffs’ complaint in this cause of action was for declaratory and injunctive relief, and we maintain it would have been futile for the State of Illinois to have raised the Eleventh Amendment argument with respect to prospective application of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.674" offset="3375438">The application of the fiction of Ex parte Young was and it’s quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.264" offset="3397799">Clearly, the Eleventh Amendment does not prohibit Federal Courts from ordering state officials to bring their conduct in conformity with the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.518" offset="3434789">Therefore, no question was entertained about this District Court’s jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment or a mandatory junction compelling future conformity with the administration of the Illinois Public Welfare Program with the federal statutes in the federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.215" offset="3505633">Furthermore, the Illinois’s Assistant Attorney General who appeared on behalf of the Illinois Department of Public Aid in the trial court as a matter of law could not waive the Eleventh Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.169" offset="3557460">This follows through with the sovereign immunity doctrine and in our state, the law is quite clear, both case law and through the Constitution that the only that can waive these arguments are the state legislature itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.564" offset="3619004">In Ford Motor Company versus the Treasury Department of the State of Indiana, Justice Reed in delivering the opinion to the Court stated, “The objection to petitioner suit has a violation of the Eleventh Amendment was first made and argued by Indiana in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.846" offset="3688176">This was in time however.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.044" offset="3696953">The Eleventh Amendment declares a policy and sets forth in explicit limitation on the federal judicial power of such compelling force.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.759" offset="3731749">This Court will consider the issue arising under this amendment in this case even though urge for the first time in this Court”.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.359" offset="3766230">But is in controversy in this case are the limitations of the applications of the Ex parte Young fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.183" offset="3793502">It is submitted that if a suit fits to declare a liability which must be met from the general revenue fund of the state which is mandated by its own constitution of matching its cause with this anticipated revenue, then Federal Courts are without jurisdiction to entertain a suit without the expressed consent of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.557" offset="3887020">This Court recently stated in Employees versus Missouri Public Health Department that it was not easy to infer that Congress in legislating pursuant to the Commerce Clause which has grown in vast proportions in its application desired silently to deprive the state of an immunity which they have long enjoyed under another part of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.859" offset="3972180">Thus, we cannot conclude that Congress conditionally operation of these facilities on the forfeiture of an immunity from suit a federal form.”</text>
            <text syncTime="984.560" offset="4015020">Similar, either is no language in the Social Security Administration Act that either expressly or impliedly shows the intent on the part of Congress to deprive the States of their immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.632" offset="4071236">There is also nothing in the compact between the Illinois Department of Public Aid and the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare that expressly conditions, Illinois’ participation in the federally-assisted program on its waiver of immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.301" offset="4141976">Consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, Congress enacted an apparently exclusive remedy in the form of cutoff of future funds when the state failed to conformed to the federal law, and this is found in 42 U.S.C. 604.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.612" offset="4211148">There is nothing in the statutory enactment that provides for an expressed or an implied right to payment of retroactive assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.527" offset="4242808">The remedy provided is the cutoff of future funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1051.540" offset="4282932">The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare recently sought legislation in the Second Session of the 91st Congress that would have granted the right of retroactive assistance to welfare recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.508" offset="4334759">This legislation was never enacted, which makes it clear that Congress never intended to give and now has rejected legislation, giving welfare recipients a right to retroactive assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.840" offset="4388153">As was pointed out in this Court in Employees versus Missouri Public Health Department, it is not easy to infer that Congress in legislating desired silently to deprive the States of an immunity that it is long enjoyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.750" offset="4451788">In Rothstein versus Wyman again, the Second Circuit Court case, the Second Circuit advanced three basic reasons why retroactive assistance should not be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.493" offset="4498704">The first relates to the fundamental principle of welfare legislation, that of satisfying present ascertain needs of the impoverished people, recognizing that federal standards are designed to ensure that those needs are equitably met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.909" offset="4564428">The court properly observed that the passage of time makes such payments compensatory rather than remedial since the coincidence between the ascertained and existing needs becomes less clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.859" offset="4616150">The second reason or interest noted by the Rothstein court was that of assuring of proper use of federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.937" offset="4648542">The Second Circuit Court found that the interest was not a personal interest to the welfare recipients since Congress provided that the cutoff of federal funds was the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.711" offset="4695562">The third and most compelling reason for implying a right to retroactive assistance was found to be a willful deterrence of state violations of federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.271" offset="4745822">None was found in the Rothstein context, and we submit that none may be found in the Illinois context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.952" offset="6276598">The General Assembly then enacted to restore sovereign immunity by enacting Section 801, Chapter 127 of the Illinois Revise Statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.268" offset="7333825">[Laughter Attempt] The first defense and the principle defense of the Director of Illinois Department of Public Aid is that the Eleventh Amendment bars the equitable restitution relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.320" offset="7386070">This defense is raised in a setting in a factual context in which it is not previously been presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.069" offset="7413029">The suit against the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid, they concede as properly in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.838" offset="7440091">They concede that the suit against the Director of the Illinois Depart -- Director of the Department of Public Aid in a relief which orders him to process every future application in the entire State of Illinois within 30 days or 60 days respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.527" offset="7502890">He’s not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.021" offset="7512816">They further concede that the portion of the provisions of the judgment which require that assistance shall be affective as of the last day of the respective time periods for all future applicants, even those that extend beyond the prescribed time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.664" offset="7587422">Even in those cases, that relief is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.244" offset="7613753">However, with respect to the incidental, equitable relief of restitution, they claim that the Eleventh Amendment bars a federal court from granting such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.213" offset="7661610">The Director claims that such relief is barred by state immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.704" offset="7695569">Consequently, he must be claiming that in denying members of the plaintiff class, their equitable entitlement and the statutory entitlement and he concedes that John Jordan and all other members of the plaintiff class were entitled to these benefits in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.479" offset="7762651">That is conceded in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.581" offset="7775086">But, it is argued that the incidental relief of granting those benefits is barred by the states immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.767" offset="7811866">However, this Court in Ex parte Young reasoned that when a state officer acts in violation of paramount federal law that he acts without the authority of the state, the language of Ex parte Young is that he acts without the authority of the state that his actions are simply an illegal act, that the state has no power to impart to its officers immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.481" offset="7938717">It is that doctrine that encompasses the entire relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.341" offset="7966093">Once this case is in Federal Court, the Eleventh Amendment which applies to suits and not to types of relief no longer is applicable, the question then becomes what -- whether the relief is appropriate, but not whether that such relief is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.825" offset="8068075">In interpreting Ex parte Young, there is no basis that is offered by the petitioners in order to bifurcate that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.085" offset="8105064">The doctrine applies to injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.034" offset="8116872">It applies to all relief that is necessary inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.355" offset="8146129">Suggestion that there is a distinction between constitutional that constitutional cases are different ignores the reality that in this case, we have a violation of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.787" offset="8195866">We have a situation where the Illinois Director has violated federal requirements and in turn the Supremacy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.735" offset="8591673">In this case, there are two theories in terms of the cause of action that would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.909" offset="8612362">One is that equitable relief is that there is a right to the statutory entitlement, and that the court in exercising its equitable powers is merely exercising the traditional powers of the court to grant appropriate and complete relief to the parties before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.081" offset="8697104">Now, under 1983, it would be possible for the -- it is our position that the court exercising its equitable powers may order state officials to make restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.757" offset="8747781">Now, the more difficult case -- if you suggest and that restitution is no different than the relief that orders state officials in connection with civil right cases, the school cases are the reapportioning of legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.375" offset="8810266">Does that answer the question, Your Honor?</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.493" offset="8890723">First, the language of the amendment itself, the language of the Amendment uses the specific word “suit”, but they concede that this suit, it says no -- the judicial power of the Unites States shall not be construed to extent to any suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.262" offset="8957806">But they concede that the suit against the Director is properly in Federal Court under the doctrine of Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.717" offset="8987585">Thus, this Court would have to distort the language of the amendment itself in order to reach the conclusion offered by the petitioners, and secondly, the doctrine of Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.677" offset="9047458">As we’ve indicated, the rational is that when a state officer violates paramount federal law, he is stripped of his official or representative capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.998" offset="12384758">In other words, you’ve taken the position that the Illinois willfully by virtue of the regulation disregarded the federal regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.994" offset="12424673">Your Honor, yes is the answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.607" offset="12435226">I think the established fact is set out in pages 85 through 88 of the appendix, established that the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid knew that the regulation was contrary to federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.733" offset="12483709">Even if, Your Honor, it’s not considered willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.984" offset="12496666">It’s clear that he understood that his regulation was in violation of federal law, if he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.202" offset="12521535">And from July 1, 1968 and forward, if there was any question in his mind as to the legality of those regulations, the Director could have filed a suit for declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.841" offset="12572108">Instead, he continues to receive federal funds for all of the period, knowing that his actions went violation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.836" offset="12612127">But Your Honor, I would point out that what we are interested in and the remedy of restitution of form is a remedy -- it is a remedy design to deter all violations of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.248" offset="12669701">We are not concern only with willful violations, but we are concerned with deterring all violations of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.372" offset="12694256">The remedy of restitution in this case, and that is within the panoply of equitable remedies that a Federal Court sitting as a court of equity has an order to grant appropriate relief to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.462" offset="12754547">This Court has held in Porter and Mitchell that are described in detail in our brief that unless a statute, otherwise restricts the powers of the court of equity, that court retains all of its traditional equitable powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.300" offset="12825913">In Porter, the question was whether restitution of excess rents charging violation of Emergency Price Control Act where a Federal Court had authority to grant restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.959" offset="12868545">The court said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.499" offset="12874710">In Mitchell, the question was whether an employee who is discharged in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act wasn’t and whether the court had the equitable power to grant restitution in/or of back wages in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.975" offset="12928627">In each case, the court reaffirmed the principle that the court of equity may grant restitution, unless if the statute otherwise restricts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.982" offset="12976692">In this case Your Honor, the remedy of restitution is necessary in order to bring about compliance with the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.196" offset="13025489">I think it is worth pausing for a moment to reflect in the situation that occurs without a remedy of restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.325" offset="13054015">Without a remedy of restitution, Director of any public aid office learns the valuable lesson that any federal provision under the Social Security Act that is mandatory may be ignored with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.054" offset="13128934">That savings and welfare budgets may be brought about by violating the law because there is no effective sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.491" offset="13162684">Any requirement that is considered onerous or unfair, maybe disregarded because there is no sanction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.136" offset="13269264">Position there were taken and was deprived those benefits, and according to the law of Illinois, each additional month they would have delayed, they would have saved the state share of payments to John Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.432" offset="13326524">So, had we not brought this suit and his application would have been remained non-acted upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.872" offset="13360274">For January, for February, for March, the state would have saved welfare payments for each of those months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.969" offset="13404578">It is our position that that -- there must be incentives not to save money by violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.838" offset="13444075">There are the Social Security Act, provides legitimate means for the States to control the expenditures and public assistance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.853" offset="13480124">This Court has so held that if the States sets its own standard of need and may pay less than the full percentage of need, that is the reasonable -- that is the legitimate way of States controlling public assistance expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.054" offset="13540937">On the other hand, state directors of public aid, must need some incentives to pay careful attention to federal requirements whenever they are enforcing, whenever they are adopting their regulations in taking positions in the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.722" offset="13643651">We would point out to the Court that the present remedies of an injunction prospectively only is not a deterrent, and certainly, the remedy of a total cutoff of federal funds is not a deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.739" offset="13695687">It is only the remedy of restitution that provides a deterrent and conversely provides an incentive to comply with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.271" offset="13741871">We would, at the very least in this cooperative scheme of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.293" offset="13761933">The States agree to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.582" offset="13775099">That is the central condition upon which the Federal Government provides to the states billions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.479" offset="13802684">States agree that we will conform to federal law, and that’s their only part of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.528" offset="13830896">If cooperative federalism is to work, it must work under scheme where state officers respect the Supremacy Clause and the supremacy of federal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.614" offset="13875200">If there is not -- if this Court were to reverse on the grounds of the remedy of restitution was inappropriate, it would provide a valuable lesson to state law officials that there is no sanction for violating the law, and particularly in the case, given the established facts that the director was aware that his -- that the owner regulations was contrary to law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.497" offset="14394723">But of course, what we are interested in is deterring violations of all laws, and if a court rules that a state provision is contrary to Social Security Act and the Supremacy Clause, we must remember that the plaintiffs then are being deprived to this work deprived of their statutory entitlements, and all that of remedy or restitution does, it places them in the position that they would have been in but for the violation of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3767.291" offset="15145900">So, we do have a problem of having peak periods and having low periods as to determining eligibility.</text>
