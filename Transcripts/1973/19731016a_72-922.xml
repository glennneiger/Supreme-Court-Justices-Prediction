            <text syncTime="113.537" offset="530913">It may have been the basic brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.340" offset="546064">Our basic point has been all along the notice requirements under the Mullane decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.240" offset="585665">But we thought the equal protection argument was involved also when the decision by the Oklahoma Supreme Court came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.727" offset="631641">The facts are that the appellants are the successors in interest of mineral owners under 40 acres of land in Seminole County of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.455" offset="698619">These mineral owners own no surface rights at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.307" offset="717949">It was strictly severed mineral interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.133" offset="753267">The Oklahoma law is that the surface owners are committed to pay the ad valorem taxes, and the mineral owners have no responsibility for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.646" offset="811363">In 1952, the surface owner failed to pay the ad valorem taxes and the County Treasurer put the land on the publication notice for the original sale in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.624" offset="891193">Now, in Oklahoma, ad valorem tax sales are an administrative process by the county officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.105" offset="941140">It starts with an original sale when the surface owner fails to pay the taxes, and the County Treasurer must place the land on that original sale if the taxes are not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.719" offset="1023582">He publishes notice for the original sale, and in the publication notice, he includes only the description of the land, and there is no personal service, or process, or any mailing, or posting on the land, or anything about nature at the original sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.311" offset="1141969">At the sale there are two ways that it can go, if there is a bid by an individual, and I'm speaking of the law in effect in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.595" offset="1199125">If there is a bid by an individual, the individual receives a certificate of paid taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.324" offset="1237995">If there is not a bid by an individual then it is bid off to the County Treasurer, and he receives the certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.225" offset="1301629">It constitutes a lien on the land, which I would assume would be a property interest under the due process clause and the later decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.874" offset="1348232">I believe there's a decision that holds that the complete title does not have to be held to have due process rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.154" offset="1481352">And one of my key points is that if there had been notice given adequate under the constitution at the original sale, then we could not argue that there was no notice at the time of the resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.581" offset="1551047">But since there wasn’t any notice of the original sale and the resale in our argument, then we feel that we have to consider the original sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.490" offset="6522671">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.144" offset="6541375">I believe it is absolutely imperative that the chronological order of facts as to how this case reached this Court to be spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.128" offset="6585260">First, we’re dealing with 40 acres of land in Seminole County as Mr. Legg has indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.608" offset="6607203">The taxes became delinquent for four years, first delinquency occurred in ‘52 and subsequently until ’55.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.410" offset="6638341">In 56 a resale, 1956 a resale tax deed was issued in May to the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.696" offset="6675540">It was filed of record on June the 6th, 1956, and it covered in addition to the 40 acres some 12 other partial to real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.170" offset="6721411">Thereafter, in 1963, the appellees executed an oil and gas lease to Christie-Stewart Oil Company, who was actually the party plaintiff when this litigation first arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.415" offset="6778358">During the period from 1956 until 1965 when the lawsuit was filed, the Trial Court found that the appellees had been an open, notorious, and adverse, and in continuous possession of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.758" offset="6859755">And one of the elements of the holding of the Trial Court was that the claims of the appellants was barred by the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.843" offset="6900088">The suit by the oil company was filed in 1965 in order to perfect their lease, because their attorneys who examined the title of course realized that this was a resale tax deed, and there was always a degree of uncertainty about its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.919" offset="6972395">The appellants then filed an answer in the cross-petitioner and brought in the appellees as party’s defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.748" offset="6999771">The appellees then filed an answer to the Cross--Petitioner which they specifically raised the statute of limitation that the appellants were barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.052" offset="7044911">The first issues in the case the validity of the oil and gas lease was adjudicated by the trial court in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.965" offset="7076571">And then for some reason, unknown to my self since I was not personally involved in the original trial, the issues as between the appellant and the appellees was not decided until 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.070" offset="7137071">During that period, an oil well was drilled upon the property and production headed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.185" offset="7161522">And I’m sure that keenly increased interest of all parties when that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.797" offset="7191928">I think it is also absolutely necessary that this Court have a crystal clear understanding of the statutory procedure on tax sales in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.509" offset="7222753">First of all, the statutes hold that it is the burden of the taxpayer to come forward and pay his tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1794.350" offset="7254100">As to the surface owner, yes, Your Honor, to come forward and pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.686" offset="7271445">Mr. Legg is correct and that non-producing oil and gas interest are not subject to ad valorem on tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.770" offset="7299866">They are deemed included in the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.031" offset="7312823">Only when production first arises do severed mineral bear any ad valorem tax, and that is in lieu of tax for growth production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.667" offset="7359425">After the tax has become delinquent, there is a certificate sale which occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.399" offset="7386384">At that time, the County Treasurer runs a publication saying forth illegal description of the property in amount of tax due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.030" offset="7416895">Any party can then come in and buy a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.258" offset="7433822">This allows the party to have a lien upon land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.440" offset="7450540">One of the requirements at that time is that the purchaser must pay the full amount of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.386" offset="7474260">So, at that period, the County Treasurer has collected this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.740" offset="7495680">He has performed his service as required by law and collected 100 cents on the dollar for the delinquent taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.691" offset="7527549">The certificates holder then is required to hold the tax certificate for at least two years, and anytime after 2 years and before 10 years which bars the certificate by statute of limitations, he may apply to the county Treasurer for a tax deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.239" offset="7605708">Now the specific statute that gives the tax certificate holder that right provides that he will obtain upon receipt of the tax deed from the County Treasurer, a perfect title provided that the tax certificate holder give notice to all of the owners of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.993" offset="7696718">Not owners as reflected by the records of the County Treasurer's office, but all of the owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.784" offset="7731931">That that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.579" offset="7735066">And the Oklahoma Supreme Court has by numerous cases held that the term owner as used in that statute and placing that burden upon the tax certificate holder includes, mortgages, it includes any land holder it includes severed mineral interest and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.546" offset="7802984">Now, Mr. Legg has referred to some confusion between the Supreme Court and of Oklahoma and the case involving a tax certificate deed when it did not apply the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.870" offset="7856274">The distinction in that case is that it was a certificate deed, and it was stipulated in that case that the tax certificate holder when he applied for the tax deed, did not give the statutory notice to the then mineral owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.511" offset="7914789">And the Court said that one of the conditions precedent to you acquiring your appropriate title is that you fulfill your obligation, my statute and give the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.238" offset="7953659">And therefore since you did not give the notice, the mineral holder’s interest was never acquired by your certificate deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.838" offset="7988140">Therefore having never acquired his interest, the statute of limitations would not run, because you were not in possession of his interest, having not acquired it in the deed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.211" offset="8117603">During this period of time, anyone having any interest in property is free to redeem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.870" offset="8136202">The Supreme Court has also held that a non-producing mineral holder may redeem taxes at anytime and there by obtains a lien upon the interest of the surface owner, and may enforce that lien by equitable foreclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.438" offset="8502544">In many cases, if there are undivided interests in the surface owner, they may have more than one name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.348" offset="8526158">Now it is interesting to note that in 1965, the Oklahoma legislature changed the statute on resale tax deed requiring not only publication, but also a mailing of a notice to the owner as reflected by the county assessor’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.338" offset="8590106">Now as to position to appellees that this clearly wasn’t application of the Oklahoma legislature of the rules of the Mullane and the subsequent case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.129" offset="8653218">And I think if I was in the position to having to argue before this Court that that was the same situation with the mineral owners in face of Mullane and the other cases, I could not prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.926" offset="8700447">Clearly, I think the legislature in ‘65 when they amended the statute and required not only publication with the owners name in it, but also mailing to his last known address and reflected by the record of County Treasurer, they complied with Mullane and were attempting to comply with Mullane.</text>

            <text syncTime="2445.574" offset="9859030">Then the party would have to take the book and page of each of this instruments, go then to the general recording data and examine each of the instruments in order to find out what exactly the instrument said, because the reference in the track index book is merely to date it was recorded, the nature of the instrument whether it be warranty deed, mineral deed, quick claim deed, mortgage and the names of the grantor and the grantee, and the legal description of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.663" offset="10143451">If there are no bidders in the county as required by law to the bid property in, we then go to the resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.391" offset="10166335">At the resale, you can buy the tax, the property for anything less than what the tax is due, or anything more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.274" offset="10197891">It is my opinion and of course not being a member of legislature, I don’t know the reasoning behind it, but it is my opinion in order to make it attractive since the taxes are now delinquent for four years for a person to bid at the resale, the legislature deemed that it be viable if you bid, then the county will give you a perfect virgin title of that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.898" offset="10280333">And that is to encourage bid, since they’ve already been aware on one time and have received no bids, and the second time out, the county can sell it for less than the tax is due or more, if there are a number of bidders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.697" offset="10327562">But at that point, if the county does not, if there are no bidders at the resale, then the county is required to bid it in, and it is deeded to the county commissioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="3677.087" offset="14785097">The reason for the four year gap in the pursuit of this case that the Mr. Rolston noted was that there were some estates pending and it wasn’t carried forward until those estates were closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.105" offset="14841208">Then I would also like to point out that Oklahoma is the least is an example of the least strict tax foreclosure procedure in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.857" offset="14896170">It’s strictly judicial, I mean strictly administrative, it has no, you don’t have to ever go in to Court, you don’t have to ever give any notice except this publication service and there are 11 states in that category according to my research and there are 14 states however that have fully judicial tax lien foreclosure procedures, where you have to bring all parties into Court and foreclose it just like you would mortgage it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.173" offset="15029394">In that situation there would have to be a process issued to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.603" offset="15059174">And so, we have 11 states with least strict 14 states with more strict and we have 39 states, either more strict or somewhere in the middle where they have, even though they’re using an administrative procedure, they have to give notice either formal process, or mailing, or of some nature that goes beyond just the publication in this case.</text>
