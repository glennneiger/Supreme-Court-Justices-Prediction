            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We'll resume arguments in Windward Shipping against American Radio Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.822" offset="108042">Mr. Schulman, you have 27 minutes left.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_schulman" startTime="10.988" stopTime="351.976">
            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="10.988" offset="120686">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.537" offset="134896">Of the -- just before the recess at yesterday’s session, discussion was had relative to the wages being paid the seamen aboard these foreign vessels and I want to make it quite clear that is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.286" offset="189858">The only purpose of that is to show the truthfulness of the picketing pursuant to this Court’s dictates in Linn versus Plant Guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.150" offset="229355">The underlying issue in this case, as we see it, is really one of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.990" offset="248686">We do not think there's an issue present here of access to court, but one of applying jurisdictional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.066" offset="289019">As we see it, this case breaks down into a dichotomy on the one hand of what we refer to as conduct of the trilogy nature, meaning the Benz, Incres, and McCulloch.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.769" offset="343876">On the other hand, we have present, this Court’s holdings in Marine Cooks and Panama and Ariadne as to whether it really is the exercise of Section 7 rights, and I'd like to direct my attention to that dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.468" offset="406570">It is clear that in McCulloch, Benz, and Incres present there was an attempt and conduct by the Unions to organize, represent, in effect, be the statutory bargaining agent for the people aboard that -- those vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.671" offset="479399">And this Court, in Ariadne, summarized that conduct in the holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.518" offset="498834">And, contrary to what my friend says, the -- there are only certain maritime operations of a foreign-flag vessel which are without the reach of a statute and Congress never intended the statute to be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.115" offset="561215">And when the Act was construed in the trilogy cases, it was held that the construction they have sought not requested, this Court said, would necessitate inquiry into the internal discipline and order of a foreign vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.428" offset="642508">And, it was that intervention and only that intervention, that this Court felt and the holdings go, would bring about the possible conflict in international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.556" offset="698932">Thus, as this court went on further in Ariadne, the Act never had any intention to cover in its coverage disputes between foreign ships and their foreign crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.782" offset="763925">That is what is referred to as to the internal order and discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.186" offset="789525">The court again, referring to the Ariadne case, said, “The conduct, there present, belied any intent of involvement in that relationship and it is that relationship which could possibly lead to the conflict with foreign or international law and, in effect, present in the trilogy cases was our exporting of American law upon the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.810" offset="911987">Now we turn to the other part of the dichotomy, the activity of American citizens here in the United States and the exercise of their Section 7 rights and, that, we have in Marine Panama -- Marine Cooks versus Panama and in Ariadne.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.462" offset="982622">In those cases, we have American citizens saying -- paraphrasing as follows, “Look, we have had employment here in the United States for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.769" offset="1035807">And we now find ourselves in a terrible situation economically.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.748" offset="1055765">For many reasons, truthful reasons, our employment has been taken from us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.430" offset="1082514">Right here in New York Harbor, in Seattle Harbor, in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.033" offset="1104875">And we ask you as fellow citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.952" offset="1116578">Please do not patronize these vessels which, we are truthfully saying, are taking our employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="267.417" offset="1146462">That's Section 7 rights as we see it and that is the exercise by American seamen, as a class of working people, the rights to which they are entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.622" offset="1195259">Now within that dichotomy, and that's what we're faced with, the State Court has the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.707" offset="1235592">As this State Court below did, it took the case and the court said, “Where does this proverbial apple fall?</text>
            <text syncTime="299.168" offset="1273417">Does it fall within the trilogy conduct and, therefore, there is no Labor Board's jurisdiction as McCulloch, Benz, and Incres hold or does it fall on the other side of the orchard which, in effect, is the preservation of their domestic employment?”</text>
            <text syncTime="318.731" offset="1351680">The court made the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.782" offset="1351889">The Court concluded that the conduct engaged here was not trilogy conduct and that, under those circumstances, having exercised jurisdiction and having found that it is activities to protect their domestic employment, the Court concluded that based upon this Court’s decision such conduct is suggested as actually protected conduct and certainly arguably protected.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="351.976" offset="1484696">You've spoken, Mr. Schulman, of the message that picketers were undertaking to give to Americans, that is, “Don't try to -- don't patronize these people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="368.520" offset="1550838">But, the -- is there -- would it be fair to say that there is another message involved here to foreign-flag ships, that is, “conform to American standards or keep out of our ports”?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>

            <text syncTime="384.988" offset="1616666">What the message --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="385.528" stopTime="392.913">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="385.528" offset="1618860">But if they conform to American standards, you would then -- are you saying that you then have no basis for picketing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_schulman" startTime="392.913" stopTime="483.950">
            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="392.913" offset="1648431">No, what I am saying is if we, as American seamen, have our employment opportunities, then we have no protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.978" offset="1676643">Now, but what we are seeking is our American opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.173" offset="1685420">To give a classic example, yesterday, in reference to a question referred to my friend, he mentioned a case in Mobile, Alabama, before the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.786" offset="1731918">And in that case the record shows, Your Honor, while these people were protesting for their loss of employment, two American vessels were laid up looking for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.658" offset="1767340">This is what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.393" offset="1774341">We are not seeking under any circumstances, to tell to any foreign nation that they cannot come to the American -- was what we are seeking is a protection of our employment, our domestic opportunities to give us an economic opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.673" offset="1835468">And I realize that lying around is fine but we are also cognizant, equally so, of repercussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.222" offset="1869636">We recognize that Congress possesses the power, if it sees fit, for example, recently in the railway labor industry, where the given federal right to strike was exercised and Congress recognizing a particular situation, moved to it, and passed a legislation accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.926" offset="1948421">We're not engaging in that conduct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.208" offset="1957616">Anymore so than in the famous Court Everett Board holding in the exercise of the Section 13, a right to picket, there is a rippling effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.950" offset="2012578">Let's get back to my question.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.744" offset="2019683">If the foreign ships in question met American standards, do you say, do you conceive that you would not have any right to picket them?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="496.420" offset="2062420">Oh! I would say the -- they would not be substandard but not be truthful, Your Honor, and we've got to have truthful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.147" offset="2089378">That's the direct answer to that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="504.018" stopTime="526.606">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="504.018" offset="2092826">Now -- then from that, on the basis of what either what you said yesterday or perhaps what your friend said, would you say that it is a fact that no country in the world, having maritime activity meets our standards, are paid?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_schulman" startTime="526.606" stopTime="535.637">
            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="526.606" offset="2183210">I would say we -- I don't know of no country, I would say we enjoy one of the highest standards of living and that's why we're referring to.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="535.637" stopTime="542.846">

            <text syncTime="535.637" offset="2219259">Isn't it almost so widely recognized in maritime circles that it would be judicially noticed that if --</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="542.846" offset="2248098">I think it is a fair statement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="547.267" offset="2265861">Then, that means that no ships of any country in the world can come into our ports free of this kind of demonstration, is that not so?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="557.890" offset="2308284">That's an assumption I would not accept because if any responsible American citizen exercise that power, that's a political question and I think Congress would move to the issue and probably so.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.578" offset="2367112">And this picketing demonstrates it, Your Honor, contained in our brief as the Port of Houston authority case.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.943" offset="2404519">In there, the Court refers to an attempt -- and I'll refer to very shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.783" offset="2423850">There are 49 docks in that harbor, legions of ships.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="591.360" offset="2442240">And now you're talking about the economics of it.</text>

          <turn speaker="howard_schulman" startTime="593.194" stopTime="700.558">
            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="593.194" offset="2449554">No, there were three vessels being picketed, that's what I am saying, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.012" offset="2464810">The situation comes about anymore so than if you have domestically, in the United States, Steel Mills and organized Steelworkers stand in front of another place and saying, effect to them that their standards are below.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.489" offset="2534713">This argument I think, is analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.286" offset="2541923">For example, then you could have no more steel mills unless they pay those prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.056" offset="2560940">I don't think that is the fundamental argument and I think, fundamentally, that is more addressed to a political argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.900" offset="2588317">As I review Section 7, Congress said, and it's announced in this Court’s Benz decision, that when they passed the Act they gave the American worker rights of dignity, an economic rights to be exercised here in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.132" offset="2661251">And Congress has taken away rights when the exercise has become extreme and people act irresponsibly -- irresponsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.175" offset="2693433">There is nothing in this case, Your Honor, to indicate at any stretch of the imagination of irresponsible conduct particularly in light of this record of the loss of employment and the literal fight of these American seamen to preserve those which are remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.895" offset="2768353">That is the issue involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.046" offset="2776921">To 8 Nth degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.195" offset="2785489">Yes, of course, any power possessed by any worker in the United States in the combination may conceivably lead to a result which may not be beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.958" offset="2828539">But, is that not an issue for Congress to determine rather than a question for our judiciary to determine if that occasion never arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.744" offset="2867722">It has not arisen and that's the important issue here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Schulman</label>
            <text syncTime="707.745" offset="2907742">I would say the issue resides where there is the greatest degree of unemployment and (Inaudible) opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.884" offset="2932297">If it happens to be in a particular harbor, like in Mobile where there are legions of American seamen unemployed, then it may be that the activity may take place frequently there and perhaps in the Port of New York no activity because of unemployment situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.713" offset="3003559">I think it's no different than you have what we refer to as are stand, it's picketing in the United States unrelated to maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.513" offset="3030831">Where does that take place?</text>
            <text syncTime="740.328" offset="3038041">Maybe it's down the south where there's unorganized people.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.656" offset="3051416">This is what I'm referring to and in our case, it takes place in instances and that's what's taken place but there's been unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.033" offset="3080882">And further significant to that, Your Honor, those questions have been raised about the Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.867" offset="3104183">Number one, questions have been set -- raised about two other cases appearing in the Government’s amicus brief referred to and one in Wisconsin and one in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.878" offset="3156219">And in all those instances, the Court pleases, that the record shows some people cooperate and some didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.568" offset="3187043">Some longshoremen worked and some didn't work, and that's the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.529" offset="3206896">What I am saying is the weighing we have here, as I view it, upon the one hand, the right of American seamen is a federal right given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.646" offset="3263321">We were not excluded as a class from Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.701" offset="3283592">Congress did not say everyone is entitled to Section 7 rights except American seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.288" offset="3309923">Congress gave us the rights like everybody else, and if we're going to be excluded let's be excluded by Congress where we have an opportunity to argue the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.731" offset="3347644">Let's not be excluded by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.288" offset="3361855">This is what I find the heart of the issue and that's taking place, as I see it, is a studied attempt by these interests to do just that, take away our Section 7 rights and our right to strike and protect our interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.155" offset="3429355">Let me give you the example of what I'm referring.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.636" offset="3443252">Port of Houston authority case is one of the steps they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.280" offset="3457881">They went into the Federal Court in Houston and said to them, “Look, you are going to make an exception to Norris-La Guardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.938" offset="3488496">What is the exception?</text>
            <text syncTime="854.639" offset="3495288">The exception is international treaties, international relations, and all our ports will be tied up.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.227" offset="3521620">District Court and the Circuit unanimously affirmed and this court denied Circuit and the Circuit said, “Look, don't come to us with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.193" offset="3549518">Go to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.214" offset="3557564">Come and see what the second step is.”</text>
            <text syncTime="872.921" offset="3568431">They didn't turn around to us here and say, “Look, we have articles, ship’s articles, whatever they're referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.310" offset="3594031">They're being interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.957" offset="3600614">We want to export that law into your jurisprudence and give honor to that,” and this Court (Inaudible) cases said “we won't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.794" offset="3635931">This is our jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="891.182" offset="3641469">Now, let's move to the third area of what they're saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.846" offset="3652127">They're then saying carve out an exception from Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.872" offset="3672189">Everyone in the United States is entitled to Section 7 rights but not the American seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.174" offset="3689430">Carve that out in the interest of international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.051" offset="3704999">Then they hit what they think is the last point and they say in the Merchant Marine Act of 1970, Congress passed some legislation to help the American seamen, therefore, that should be justification, an implicit repeal of Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.239" offset="3773753">And, this is what we are faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.723" offset="3783680">We are faced with the rights of American seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.920" offset="3804473">We have done good service as American cities -- citizens and I need not plea that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.938" offset="3828506">We've lost our jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.167" offset="3841463">We have come to the only place we can come, the American Public.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.649" offset="3859331">You've said to them, “Please help us.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.471" offset="3866645">Here is the truth and here are the facts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="951.728" offset="3883677">This is what we think we have a fundamental right to do aside from constitutional issues, and the opposition has the opportunity, have access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.136" offset="3921293">If we're engaging in conduct of the trilogy nature, then we should be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.999" offset="3948774">We make no bones about it and we're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.816" offset="3955984">In fact, we want to austersize these vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.411" offset="3966433">We want no part of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.398" offset="3978344">Really, where the case boils down to in the final analysis is do American seamen have Section 7 rights or are they excluded?</text>
            <text syncTime="988.038" offset="4028918">I don't think they're excluded and I don't think any court, not jurisprudence in our country should make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.540" offset="4050860">I say it most respectfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.250" offset="4061727">This is a right we have had and this is a right, if we're going to lose it, let's lose it in the Halls of Congress where we can make our points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.308" offset="4101956">Yesterday, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked me about an analogy if the United Automobile Workers put up a picket line and I think their proper association of that is follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.124" offset="4145215">Assuming Volvo move their factory to Virginia and paid the substandard wages, I think United Automobile Workers will have the perfect right to protect it and that's what's happening to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.786" offset="4195892">They are moving, these factories in on us day after day and we have no employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.992" offset="4224731">This is the thrust of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.796" offset="4235912">There is one last argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.432" offset="4242495">Not really an argument, a request to make and I am absolutely embarrassed to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.605" offset="4263184">Last Thursday, I came to my office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.890" offset="4276349">I was served with a supplemental memorandum from the Solicitor’s Office as amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.573" offset="4307069">I called the clerk’s office on Friday to protest the fact that I know no provision and any rules for this, there was no lead made to this court, no lead was granted and equally significant in plain fairness and fair play to have an opportunity to reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.283" offset="4377913">Directed by the clerk to make my request to the courts to find unusual in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.352" offset="4402155">And my press request is just, fundamentally, either that that supplemental memorandum be rejected as not following the rules or have a reasonable opportunity in fairness to reply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.461" offset="4454609">As to the last issue on the case, not really in the case, the issue with respect to our constitutional rights to picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.751" offset="4495778">That was not tried below though we pleaded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.034" offset="4508839">We have no reason to believe that Texas Courts would deny us our constitutional rights but we do believe, however, that present in this case is activity which has found by the court below falls in the orchard, as I call it, of Section 7 protected activity and it's Section 7 Act protected activity which is actually preempted which the court may not go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.328" offset="4618031">I have nothing further to add to it, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
