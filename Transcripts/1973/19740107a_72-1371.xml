            <label>Mr. Scott P. Crampton</label>
            <text syncTime="51.244" offset="281704">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.646" offset="295288">The proceedings before Your Honor, is on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.596" offset="327158">All taxes are involved and the basic issue is a procedural one, namely, do the Anti-injunction Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act prevent the maintenance of this action for injunctive relief?</text>
            <text syncTime="79.193" offset="393509">This in turn requires consideration of the structure which Congress has provided for the litigation of tax controversies namely, proceedings to the Tax Court and then on appeal or first payment of the tax and then a refund suit either in the District Court or in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.442" offset="470518">And this tax procedure is expressly protected as we view it by the Anti-injunction Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.712" offset="507611">I realize that when you’re in a position of deferring judicial consideration of certain questions that is not a popular position to take, but it seems to us, it’s required by the laws and by the need of the United States to protect its revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.174" offset="569469">The case is before the Court on a complaint and a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.101" offset="589113">The motion to dismiss was sustained by the District Court and then reversed in part by the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.561" offset="618998">The respondent, Americans United is a nonprofit educational corporation organized in 1948 under the laws of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.895" offset="660376">Its purpose as stated in its charter is to defend and maintain religious liberty in the United States by the dissemination of knowledge concerning the constitutional principle of the separation of church and State.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.194" offset="721502">In 1950, Americans United asked the Internal Revenue Service for a determination that it was exempt from tax under comparable provisions to what is now effective in the Internal Revenue Code as Section 501 (c) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="178.365" offset="790256">The Revenue Act of 1954 in three sections provides for charitable deductible gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.621" offset="819200">One is 501 (c) (3) and then the actual deductions allowed in 170 (c) (2) and then 2055 (a) (2), the latter being the estate tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.888" offset="864340">Each of this provisions limits a charitable deductible gift to an organization and I’m quoting, “No substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation, with minor exceptions no deduction is allowed to taxpayers for political contributions” and it seems to us that this quoted provision on the exempt organization simply carries out this general policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.704" offset="991608">It may help the Court know the procedure that is followed in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.687" offset="1011461">An organization claiming to be exempt files with the Internal Revenue Service a Treasury Department Form 1023 which discloses considerable information about its organization and its form and the pertinent documents, whether it’s a successor to another corporation, a description of its activities, any financial information that it may have or financial information of predecessor, and it must show that there will be no return of assets to the organizers, a sort of built-in side principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.075" offset="1149074">If there are any problems arising after this is filed, as far as the Internal Revenue is concerned, there are opportunities for conference and the Internal Revenue Service is quite willing to discuss the situation with the organization, and tell them in what particulars they do not believe it complies and ultimately they frequently, generally work the situation out.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.922" offset="1244473">If the Internal Revenue Service is satisfied, it issues a ruling letter to the exempt organization saying that it finds that it has qualified under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.200" offset="1289509">The Internal Revenue Service of course reserves the right to look at the operation and the function of the organization in later years to see that it is operating as it represented it would and furthermore that there’s been no change in the situations that might require a further review of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.658" offset="1363383">This Court some years ago had a situation in the American Automobile Association cases where there was a revocation of a ruling that had been outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.458" offset="1398596">As far as the exempt organizations are concerned, there were 13,000 of these ruling letters issued in the last fiscal year.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.934" offset="1428480">If the 13 -- if that number of exempt organizations, how is it possible for the Service to keep track of what each one does from year-to-year and as you point out sometimes withdraw the exemption?</text>
            <text syncTime="351.731" offset="1483651">Is that -- do informers bring this to your attention or what?</text>

            <text syncTime="364.923" offset="1536418">We have a number of those cases and of course, I suppose, informers do question.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.135" offset="1553241">Now, this is one of our complaints with these procedure is that I think outsiders use the Internal Revenue Provisions as sort of a club to accomplish, a purpose that they disagree with them and to a certain extent, the Service does from time-to-time examine this.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.725" offset="1615621">It's -- I suppose they have the same problem in determining --</text>

            <text syncTime="576.946" offset="2384562">Now, in 1968 the Internal Revenue Service did take a look at “Americans United.”</text>
            <text syncTime="582.210" offset="2405564">It reconsidered the situation and the revoked its prior letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.315" offset="2426044">In doing so, it set forth in number a respondent’s substantial political activities and invoiced the Americans United in part that by engaging in general legislative activities to implement your views and by urging the enactment or defeat of proposed legislation which you believe inamicable to your principles, you have ceased to function exclusively in the educator’s role of informant and thereby encroaching upon the proscribed legislative area.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.412" offset="2618410">Shortly thereafter, the Internal Revenue Service did rule that the respondent was an exempt under Section 501 (c) (4) as a “social welfare” organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.977" offset="2660624">So it as an organization owes no taxes, but found that this did not affect the contributions to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.893" offset="2692284">It did not entitle its donors to the charitable deduction and the exemption under 501 (c) (4) also required Americans United to pay employment taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.982" offset="4636630">Now, the Anti-injunction Act as Your Honor suggested came in a long time ago, 1867, but -- and but the significant thing is we say is that this was reaffirmed by Congress when it re-enacted the Revenue Code or when it enacted the Revenue Code in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.711" offset="4715624">And the only exception to the Anti-injunction Act that we believe is pertinent is the one this Court announced in the Enochs versus Williams Packing Company case where the taxpayer alleged it would go into bankruptcy and the Court said well, still the statute had to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.233" offset="4801724">Unless the taxpayer could show that under no circumstances could the Government prevail and second, that equity jurisdiction exists because of irreparable injury for which there was no adequate legal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.314" offset="4858044">The second statute, I’ve been talking so far primarily about the Anti-injunction Act, but we also rely equally on the Declaratory Judgment Act, and this Court may recall that that was originally passed in the early 1930s and was silent as to taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.390" offset="4926276">There were several attempts made shortly thereafter to apply that statute to taxes and Congress in 1935 promptly amended the Act to provide that it should not apply to any suit with respect to federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.503" offset="4986776">And it seems to us that this is again a congressional affirmance of the Anti-injunction Act, at least a philosophy that you can’t enjoin taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.141" offset="5037349">The legislative history of this Amendment shows clearly that Congress thought the existing remedies provided -- existing procedures provided ample remedies for the correction of tax errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.914" offset="5096385">The basic complaint of the respondent is that the action of the Internal Revenue Service has materially deterred its contributors and I think this is true as I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.163" offset="5133375">But I think the same could be said for the failure of the Internal Revenue to issue the ruling in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.524" offset="5154795">But where there is a factual or legal controversy, the statutes just do not give a tax exempt status pendente lite and we believe it should not be the role of the courts to provide one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.383" offset="5206309">The administration of the tax laws has been delegated to the Treasury and to the Internal Revenue Service and if the Internal Revenue Code is to be administered by injunctions it seems to us that nothing but chaos is going to be the end-result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.358" offset="5338175">And my thought on -- continuing my thought of chaos is we have 400 some district judges and a number of suits now pending where the -- which request the Commission of Internal Revenue to reserve -- to remove the tax exemption of such organizations as labor unions, fraternal clubs, and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.966" offset="5424588">It’s quite conceivable that some organization which is opposing the views of the Americans United would bring a similar suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.510" offset="5454785">This might result in conflicting injunctions in different jurisdictions and complete confusion as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.288" offset="5489894">In our reply brief, we cited two of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.065" offset="5500970">One is the Cattle Feeders case out in Oklahoma and which the -- enjoins the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from applying a ruling that the Internal Revenue Service was to promulgate regarding year-end purchases of feed where in the view of the Internal Revenue Service, it distorted income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.002" offset="5592712">The Internal Revenue Service has also been ordered to revoke the exemption of a hospital where it did not admit indigent patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.109" offset="5633149">It seems to us that the latter case is another example of the use of the tax laws anti-injunction procedure as a club and where there is primarily a fight between private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.431" offset="5678498">It’s our view that the administration of the tax law should not be by injunction and that if the Internal Revenue Service is wrong in its determination regarding Americans United there are two adequate remedies at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.493" offset="5738684">The first as Mr. Justice White suggested is a suit to -- against the -- by the organization itself to recover the employment taxes that it’s been forced to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.469" offset="5782674">In such a proceeding, it can come in, claim it’s exempt under Section 501 (c) (3) and argue the merits of that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.229" offset="5833665">A second proceeding, it would be the suit by what the briefs refer to as the friendly donor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.826" offset="5860101">Usually, that’s the Secretary or somebody with a relatively simple return perhaps on the W-2 form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.356" offset="5886224">They make a contribution to an organization such as this, file a claim for refund and then litigate it and that is a decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.352" offset="5926139">It’s a device that’s frequently used by corporations to test taxability of dividends.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.068" offset="6029061">That was a question whether in that year, money enured to organizers and there was discovery proceeding as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.618" offset="6063229">They were convinced that it did not enure in that year and they made them a refund and mooted it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.447" offset="6090501">But I believe the Service would welcome a chance to test this on the merits and certainly, insofar as those of us who are presently in the Department of Justice are concerned, we think this is the way to meet the situation and I have told a number of tax-exempt organizations that as far as I personally was concerned will meet them in Court anytime on this fact question and get it decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.813" offset="6191961">And I think the Internal Revenue Service shares that view and they would honor a finding like that assuming of course that the operations are conducted the same way in successive years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.503" offset="6258730">The respondent speaks of itself as being a principle party but it seems to us here in legal effect it is acting as agent for its contributors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.252" offset="8441731">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.918" offset="8452389">Americans United is before this Court today largely because the decisions made by the Internal Revenue Service, relating to the administration of the Internal Revenue Codes' provisions regarding charities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.020" offset="8504842">The Service has decided to administer these provisions by a system of advanced rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.079" offset="8529084">This system is unique to the Internal Revenue Service under the charitable area and does not apply with near the force in this area as it does in other areas where rulings are issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.610" offset="8579239">The result of this decision by the Service is that a ruling that an organization is tax exempt is not merely useful, but it’s essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.472" offset="8618632">The ruling has become the sine qua non of effective fundraising for charitable organization and the denial of a ruling or the revocation of a ruling requires immediate action on behalf of the charity if it is to continue without serious financial difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.345" offset="8690103">As Mr. Crampton explained, there are two aspects of a charitable ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.100" offset="8709120">First, that the charity is exempt from income taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.870" offset="8724271">This is relatively unimportant for the small organizations, but to a large university with a significant endowment, the exemption from income taxation can be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.481" offset="8762723">But the second feature and by far the more important because it is essential to all kinds of charities, is that donations are deductible from the income of the donor and particularly from the income tax of the donor with a large income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.378" offset="8830224">The question of whether or not an organization qualifies under Section 501 (c) (3) is ultimately one for the courts to decide under the test laid down by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.690" offset="8879543">Now, the Service could have decided to administer these provisions without a system of advanced rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.483" offset="8906710">Income tax matters would be handled like other income tax matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.264" offset="8921757">Deductions could have depended upon opinions of counsel for either the charity or for the donor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.111" offset="8953208">But the Service decided long ago that a system of issuing advance rulings would be useful both to the Service and to the taxpayers to let everyone know where they stand and they have been issuing these rulings for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.578" offset="9011096">In fact, in 1969 in the tax reform act, the Congress enacted a new section, Section 508 which requires any organization seeking a 501 (c) (3) status to notify the Service in advance that they are going to claim that they are exempt, so the Service can begin considering the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.599" offset="9095105">In addition to the issuance of rulings, the Service has also prepared a document known as the Cumulative List of Exempt Organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.237" offset="9129691">Once an organization has a ruling that it is exempt under 501 (c) (3), it’s name is added to the list and the Service no longer can challenge the deductibility of gifts added to that for an organization on that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.319" offset="9189982">If the organization is not on that list, it creates enormous fundraising problems particularly with regard to the large donors for there are after all a limited number of funds available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.899" offset="9240346">And the absence of the name of an organization from that list puts that organization at a serious competitive disadvantage in seeking to attract funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.656" offset="9279321">In effect, the ruling is a license that operates seriously in the fundraising areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.471" offset="9306593">As the courts below, the court below here, the court in Bob Jones and as former Commissioner Thrower indicated these are very serious matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.038" offset="9344940">And thus, when Americans United had its 501 (c) (3) status revoked in 1969, it caused serious financial problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.351" offset="9382139">Now, it was still and is today still exempt from income taxation under 501 (c) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.627" offset="9411291">Therefore, it pays no income taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.056" offset="11124924">Well, it is important because we think it’s indicative of fact that this case is not dealing primarily with the orderly process of the collection of revenue as has been true in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.844" offset="11172153">And as the Government’s brief says, and as the Supreme Court has said in Enochs, the manifest purpose is to ensure the orderly process of the collection of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.533" offset="11214890">And we suggest that this is far from the mainstream of that kind of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.651" offset="11235370">And its particularly important because of the great need that this taxpayer has to have his ruling of equal importance is the fact that not only does it not have its ruling during this period of time, but that throughout the entire period of the refund litigation, there will be no revenue coming in because of the laws of the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.129" offset="11341218">And this is important because even if we win the refund suit at the District Court level after having waited until the end of the year so that an annual tax could be paid, waited to file a claim for refund, waiting six months after that, thereafter filing the complaint, the Government answering 60 days later, discovery beginning and perhaps the Government discovering an issue in the case that will enable it to prevail for reasons other than the reason that was given for the denial of deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.504" offset="11486772">After that happens and even if we win the case in the District Court, the ruling does not come back yet for according to the Government’s theory that even where the refund suit is won, there is still no right to have the ruling restored.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.975" offset="12140669">And that -- in that case this Court held that where the plaintiff had no plain speedy and adequate remedy at law and I emphasize the word “adequate” because that is in our view the touchstone here, that the remedy suggested by the Government is not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.998" offset="12208692">But the Court had jurisdiction not withstanding the literal language of the Anti-injunction Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.122" offset="12325198">The decisions in Allen and Williams Packing are irreconcilable for one very important reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.732" offset="12351634">The Williams Packing decision predicates jurisdiction upon a finding that under no view of the facts or law could the Government prevail, but in Allen, not only could the Government not prevail but in the very same opinion, this Court upheld the determination that the statute challenged by the University of Georgia Regents was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.066" offset="12452989">Therefore, the decisions are irreconcilable and the Government must contend that Allen was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.509" offset="12478798">We see no reason to believe that this Court overruled Allen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.644" offset="12943360">All that we are seeking here is an opportunity to litigate the question of whether or not our ruling was properly revoked during the course of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.112" offset="12993202">All we want is a chance to obtain an injunction so that we will not have to wait years until the refund suit is concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.939" offset="13028519">We are not as the Government suggests in its reply brief at page 38, asking for an automatic right to retain the ruling regardless of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.169" offset="13069375">We are fully aware of the standards both at the preliminary injunction stage and what we must do with the merits in order to retain the ruling which we have been without for almost four years now. But at least, it’s a chance and it’s a chance for organization such as this, an equally important for fledgling organizations which have no financial backing to rely against -- to rely on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.468" offset="13650651">My share in the oral argument is to emphasize just a few points which makes clear that opinion of the Court of Appeals below which holds that this case does raise a substantial constitutional question should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.470" offset="13706658">I fear that the Commissioner’s counsel have misstated inadvertently the legal question presented where in their brief they say the question presented is “whether the respondent is barred by the Anti-injunction Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act or otherwise from obtaining injunctive or declaratory relief requiring the Commissioner to issue a ruling that respondent is exempt from Section 501 (c) (3) and therefore the contributions to it are deductible under Code Section 170 (c) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.746" offset="13843749">Americans United has never argued that the Commissioner should rule that it is exempt under 501 (c) (3).</text>
