            <text syncTime="19.314" offset="154018">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, to summarize Central Tablet versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.378" offset="186305">The question is whether an involuntary conversion by casualty for the purposes of the application of Section 337 occurs at the point of the casualty which in this case preceded the doctrine of the plan liquidation, or whether instead it occurs at the point that a non-conditional obligation to pay insurance proceeds on the part of the insurance carriers arises, which in this case post-dated adoption of the plan of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.584" offset="323082">I stated yesterday, it’s the position of the government that an involuntary conversion by casualty for the purposes of the application on Section 337 occurs in every case at the point of the casualty, and that an involuntary conversion by casualty is a single destructive event.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.204" offset="413571">It’s our contrary position that an involuntary conversion by casualty is a gain or loss producing transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.786" offset="451918">And that the purposes of Section 337, that transaction is complete on an enforceable right to ensure its proceeds arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.050" offset="508970">We submit that the casualty is much like an executory contract of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.172" offset="541466">In an executory contract of sale by treasury regulation, it is distinguished from a contract of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.505" offset="570723">A contract of sale in turn is defined as a contract in which there is an obligation on the part of the buyer to buy, and an obligation on the part of the seller to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.403" offset="622341">And, if it is not until there those obligations with the sale under treasury regulation is complete for the purposes of the application of Section 337.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.752" offset="667794">And, we submit that the comparable event, the taxable event to that sale is an involuntary conversion when enforceable right to proceeds arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.422" offset="1574452">I was wondering, when this casualty is thrown upon you, and as you indicated yesterday was a vital factor in the decisions of liquidate rather than to carry on whether your posture here for on accrual basis taxpayer sponsoring that statutory purpose in anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.576" offset="1703079">The 337 was obviously on the surface designed to meet what is the difference between a casualty and on executory contract of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.861" offset="1752189">The only difference is its thrust upon this taxpayer, he has no choice or it has no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.518" offset="1778834">In an ordinary sale or an exchange, the taxpayer can take his own time in maneuvering negotiate, and then still has the remedial of fact of Section 377, that on an equity basis, I think it’s more equitable to include an involuntary conversion by casualties or this ordinary sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.580" offset="1939017">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.454" offset="1950616">I think it would be useful for the Court to focus on the text of this statute, which is set fort on page two of petitioner’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.739" offset="1991680">The statute provides that one, if a corporation adopts the plan of complete liquidation and then two, with in a 12-month period beginning on the date of the adoption of the plan, all of its assets are distributed in complete liquidation to it shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.303" offset="2069943">Then and only then shall no a gain or loss be recognized to the corporation from the sale or exchange by it of property within the 12-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.794" offset="2119889">Statute mandates a particular time sequence of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.381" offset="2142250">First, a plan must be adopted thereby identifying the corporation as one which is commencing a liquidation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.707" offset="2183628">Secondly, once the plan is adopted, then a 12-month period begins to commence running forward in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.658" offset="2219363">The statute is a strict statute, it’s so far as sales or exchanges occurring before the adoption of the plan or sales or exchanges occurring after the 12-month period has run cannot be protected by the non recognition provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.898" offset="2300343">Now, here, the sequence of events which have occurred in this transaction demonstrate that it is exactly the reverse of the situation that Congress intended to benefit by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.179" offset="2353424">Because first, we have here the file on September 10, 1965, at that point in time, the taxpayer did not evidence any intension to liquidate, indeed it has been discussed the file itself prompted the decision to liquidate in part because a major asset of a corporation was destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.052" offset="2436911">Then some more than eight months later on May 14th 1966, petitioner adopted a plan of complete liquidation by action of its Board of Directors and presumably by ratification of its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.635" offset="2495321">Now, in order to place the gain accruing from the insurance proceeds, the petitioner must somehow place that gain after the adoption of the plan that is after May 14th 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.754" offset="2559791">For it arises before, the statute cannot apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.465" offset="2574629">Now, it does this by arguing that what has occurred here after the plan was somewhat like in negotiation of sale, it dickered with the insurance company over the amount of the award, and ultimately, that was concluded sometime in August, after the adoption of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.162" offset="2653414">But, it is plain what occurred here was not a sales negotiation in any sense that term represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.565" offset="2682984">It was simply a compensation for loss which the insurance company pays pursuant to the contract of buyer insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.414" offset="2718407">This post-buyer discussions which the petitioner had with its insurance company is simply directed to the amount of the compensation, and the fact that this transaction is not a sale, it’s well settled by this Court’s decision in flack Flaccus Leather Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.514" offset="2782772">Now, the fact that this is not a sale might be deemed to the end of the matter for we have a statute here that talks about a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.868" offset="2816209">But, it is not the end of the matter because two Court decisions, the Court of Claims, and that Towanda Textiles case, and the Kent Manufacturing decisions of the Fourth Circuit have included within the context of Section 337, gains from involuntary conversions such as this, that is gains from the destruction of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.439" offset="2902518">But, the situation of those cases is entirely different insofar as those -- the facts that those cases can be fit within the time sequence mandated by Congress in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.816" offset="3527993">And I think that those cases can best be explained in terms of the reason that prompt to their result by the fact that had the fire not occurred in those cases, the corporation surely would have sold the property pursuant to the normal kind of Section 337 plan that tax practitioners are well familiar with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.459" offset="4722625">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the situations are varied under both Federal and State Condemnation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.942" offset="4752509">We saw the case called Dwight versus United States, a Second Circuit case which involved a State Condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.579" offset="4783020">In that situation is very much like a sudden event of fire. The Board of Estimate of New York City simply filed a damage map in the Court, and that resulted in the taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.063" offset="4837042">To let the condemnation proceeding to fix the amount of the just compensation stretched over many years without any payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.392" offset="4874344">And Second Circuit held in that case that notwithstanding, the fact that the condemnation was sudden and that the petitioner there could not -- the taxpayer there could not even finely adopt the plan even it had known of the -- because it did not know the event still, Section 337 did not apply to insulate these gains from corporate taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.764" offset="4963788">And, there are other Federal Condemnation situations notably in the Likins-Foster Honolulu case which we cite, where there are deposits that paid in before then the condemnee can draw down on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.611" offset="5011226">But, I think that the situation -- the situation sufficiently vary that you can’t really make a general rule about the practice on the condemnation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.878" offset="5060232">When the Second Circuit considered the Dwight case, it was based with the situation far more, shall we say “harsh” than this case, because the Board of Estimate simply filed this damage map, and that was the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.310" offset="5118015">The taxpayer simply did not have time to adopt the plan of complete liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.398" offset="5138390">The Second Circuit simply said the statute has strict requirements and if it is to be modified to cover all gains from involuntary conversions then Congress has to modify the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.312" offset="5186038">As we point out in our brief, an advisory commission in 1959, so urge Congress to modify the statute to cover all gains from involuntary conversions whether they arise before -- whether the event arises before or after the adoption of the plan and Congress did not act on this proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.487" offset="5274645">So, what you have here is a situation where taxpayers subjected to sudden events such as condemnation, clearly cannot have the benefit of this statute if they do not abide by the statutory time sequence of first adopting the plan and then within the 12-months experiencing this event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.558" offset="5362939">What the taxpayer’s position here would lead to, we submit, would be a situation where taxpayers suffering destruction of insured property would be accorded to preference of a taxpayer’s suffering a sudden condemnation very similar to what happened in the Dwight case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.679" offset="5431484">Now, what petitioner attempts to distinguished these condemnation cases, it says, condemnation creates an enforceable obligation to pay a certain amount of just compensation by the condemning authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.773" offset="5487804">But, the destruction of its insured property here gave rise, so it says, to simply a conditional or contingent claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.816" offset="5524062">But what are these contingencies that the taxpayer is relying upon to base its arguments to push forward to this positive event after the adoption of a plan in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.343" offset="5574113">It talks about the filing of a notice of loss, it talks about the filing of a proof of loss, and it talks about other proof complying with other procedural requirements under the contract of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.960" offset="5624581">But the record here indicates that these procedural requirements had already been met by petitioner prior to the adoption of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.171" offset="5665437">For example, a record indicates here that negotiation where the fire started, fire was on September 10th,1965, the negotiations that the petitioner commenced with insurance property began as early as October 8, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.153" offset="5721339">In fact, petitioner’s own counsel in the District Court, testify that the proof of loss in this case was filed prior to December 1965, again prior to the adoption of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.407" offset="5770344">Petitioner does not meet its own proposed test, and that is the test proposed by the District Court in Kinney case on which it relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.361" offset="5806184">But in any event, we don’t think that these procedural requirements under the insurance contract create the claim against the insurance company because just as a condemnation taking creates the claim under -- against the condemning authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.795" offset="5883925">So thus, the destructive event of the fire, we submit, creates the claim against the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.063" offset="5909002">But as this irrevocable event of either taking by condemnation or by fire, which converts the property into the obligation running against the insurance company go with the authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.810" offset="6859964">Yes, well, this raises a question as to whether you are -- I suppose under the tax benefit rule, if you had not got any tax benefit from the loss, you don’t have to take that it into income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.572" offset="6906984">I was imagining it would be only the net of the loss, I think that’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.103" offset="6925166">Now, we think that this subsequent events upon which petitioner relies, that is its negotiations with the insurance company, its compliance with the procedural requirements of the policy simply go if an aid of the collection of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.205" offset="6989531">They do not create the claim against the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.696" offset="7003533">Now, while the taxpayer recognizes that this transaction is not a sale here, it argues that into its reply brief, it has many of the characteristics of a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.988" offset="7048673">What it says in effect is the insurance award is analogous to a sales price, and it assumes that you cannot have a sale without a determinable sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.117" offset="7089215">Well, this assumption which was made by the Morton opinion as well, we think is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.111" offset="7117218">There are many instances where you can have a sale not only for tax purposes but for any purpose without the existence of the determinable sales prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.881" offset="7152222">For example, a business can be sold for a percentage of future profits over a stated period of time, and the sales price in that situation is not determinable until the end of the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.915" offset="7208438">But no one would doubt it, there were a transfer of the benefits and burdens of ownership to that business, that there was a sale, clearly a sale occurs in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.538" offset="7246890">And to that extent, we think that the petitioner’s analogy is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.566" offset="7267056">Alternatively, the taxpayer argues here that the payment by the insurance company could be a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.961" offset="7292552">It talks about a situation where the insurance company will pay an adjustment for salvage, and presumably take over the ownership of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.826" offset="7328078">Now, first of all, there’s no showing that it has occurred here, it didn’t occur here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.145" offset="7345319">Well, this payment was simply compensation for a loss, but even if there was -- even in such a situation, we think that the compensation for the loss element of the payment would not be analogous to a sales price, so to speak, because that simply is a payment for a decrease in value of the damaged property, value which has disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.839" offset="7432150">That is -- can in no way, be analogize to an element of the payment which would be in the sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.049" offset="7464960">And finally, as we point out in greater detail in our brief, we think that the net effect of the petitioner’s position here is contrary to settled rules governing the holding period of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.000" offset="7516787">Almost 40 years ago, this Court held in the McPhee case, that holding period -- the concept of holding period is coterminous with the concept of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.870" offset="7560255">And, as corollary to those cases, there are other cases which hold, that when property is destroyed, its holding period ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.969" offset="7596617">Now, those holdings were rendered in a situations involving sunken ships, but the lesson is equally instructive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.239" offset="7637682">In those cases, a taxpayer board a ship on January 1st and then it sunk on March 1st, to use the example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.475" offset="7674671">The insurance proceeds however were not paid until July 15, and what the taxpayers in those cases argued was that the holding period -- their holding period should be stretched forward beyond six months to the point where the insurance proceeds were paid and in that way, to try to get long term capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.569" offset="7767040">Now, the Court rejected that notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.633" offset="7775295">The holding period ended when the ship sunk, when the destructive event occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.290" offset="7797864">So, we think that the -- we think that those holdings are instructive as to the error that petitioners making in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.522" offset="7830883">Because if petitioner’s argument is right that its so called “sale” under the statute did not occur until the insurance proceeds were paid, the implication of its argument is that a sale occurred long before after its coterminous holding period, an ownership have ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.022" offset="7908833">We think that’s wrong and we think that that’s simply another demonstration of the error of petitioner’s position and the reason why the Court’s judgment at Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.168" offset="7953450">I have nothing further to say if the Court has no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.623" offset="8551236">And with that in mind, I would like to read Treasury of Regulation 14437-2A which says, “In ascertaining whether a sale or exchange occurs on or after the date in which the plan of complete liquidation has adopted the fact that negotiations were sale may have been commenced either by the corporation or insurer.” All of those are both shall be disregarded.</text>
