            <text syncTime="18.434" offset="150465">In these two cases, Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Powell take no part.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.083" offset="185051">In number 948, first one, involving the CATV, a trade association, Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.714" offset="259553">In the second case, Federal Power Commission versus New England Power, Mr. Justice Marshall has filed has concurred in the result in a separate opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.691" offset="319530">These two cases involve an act passed by Congress in 1952 called the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, which authorized each federal agency to prescribe by regulation, such fee for the agencies services as determined to be fair and equitable taking into consideration the direct and indirect cost to the government for the value to the recipient, public policy of interest served in other pertinent facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.664" offset="479399">In the first case, National Cable Television Association case, the Federal Communications Commission established a fee which was challenged in the Court of Appeals in the Fifth Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the Commissionâ€™s action.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.649" offset="583367">In the second case, the Federal Power Commission established a so-called fee, services rendered to New England Power Company and on review that was set aside by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.573" offset="671033">We conclude, for reasons stated in two opinions filed with clerk that these fees, set by these two commissions, did not comport with the law or out of line with the requirements of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.168" offset="753371">And that both agency actions must be disapproved, which results in reversing in The National Cable Television Association case and affirming in the New England Power Company case.</text>
