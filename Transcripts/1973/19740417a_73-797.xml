            <text syncTime="71.671" offset="363416">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.808" offset="375954">This case is here on appeal by the Miami Herald from a decision of the Florida Supreme Court, which sustained the constitutionality of Section 104.38 Florida statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.586" offset="427050">This appeal involves the constitutionality of that statute on its face under the First and the Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.564" offset="459024">This statute involves the question of whether a newspaper under the First Amendment may be compelled by the Florida Legislature, to print the political statement of a candidate which it does not desire to print.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.918" offset="520464">The facts of this case arose when the appellee, Mr. Tornillo became a candidate from Dade County for the Florida Legislature in the 1972 State Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.525" offset="566857">In 1913, the Florida Legislature had enacted a criminal statute, which is reproduced in the appendix in full at the top of page 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.704" offset="607608">That statute requires a newspaper to give a political candidate, free space to reply to any criticism of the political candidate published by a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.712" offset="655569">Statute on its face applies to criticism of a candidate whether published in news articles, columns or editorials.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.518" offset="690782">The truthfulness or fairness of the criticism is irrelevant under the statute and the violation of that statute is the crime punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine up to $1,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.852" offset="752118">There is no legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.233" offset="761731">It was adopted as a part of the States Corrupt Practices and Elections Act and there’s no record of it’s use for almost 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.773" offset="803840">Its First judicial test was in 1972 in State versus News Journal.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.983" offset="996728">No, he was a candidate for an office in State Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.581" offset="1019089">In the first judicial test of this statute in Florida courts in 1972 in State versus News Journal, the Mayor of Daytona Beach had the newspaper arrested for refusing to print the Mayor’s reply to an article critical of the Mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.763" offset="1083768">The lower court held the statute violated free press and due process guarantees of the U.S. in the Florida Constitutions and dismissed the criminal proceedings, that decision is reproduced in the appendix at page 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.780" offset="1143850">At that time, the Florida Attorney General conceded the invalidity of the statute and refused to appeal the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.512" offset="1174779">Mr. Tornillo became a candidate for the legislature some seven months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.934" offset="1196513">That election was scheduled for October 4, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.781" offset="1219918">On September 20, seven -- 14 days before that election, the Herald printed an editorial critical of Mr. Tornillo’s candidacy, that editorial appears at page 5 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.735" offset="1275716">It referred to Mr. Tornillo, criticizing his opponent for violating the election law.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.623" offset="1299226">The editorial pointed out that Mr. Tornillo was the same one, who had led an illegal teachers’ strike and the editorial concluded by saying it would be inexcusable if the voters elected Mr. Tornillo to the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.155" offset="1361398">Mr. Tornillo waited a week and on September 27, submitted a statement he entitled, “Pat Tornillo in the CTA record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="330.571" offset="1399014">He demanded that the Herald print that statement, pursuant to the Florida statute, which carries criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.844" offset="1432137">Mr. Tornillo in his statement did not claim that the editorial was not truthful and he did not seek a retraction under the Florida Retraction Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.767" offset="1471843">He claimed that the Herald was dwelling on past history and he listed his own accomplishments during the past four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.089" offset="1505071">The Herald did not print that statement of candidate Tornillo.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.978" offset="1524611">The Herald printed a second editorial on September 29, which appears in the appendix at page 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.656" offset="1555331">Mr. Tornillo submitted a second statement the next day and demanded that it'd be printed, that statement appears at page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.818" offset="1588036">Again, there was no claim that the editorial was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.928" offset="1608411">The Herald did not print Mr. Tornillo’s statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.315" offset="1621995">The next day on October 1, Mr. Tornillo filed suit in the Dade County Circuit Court, seeking actual and punitive damages and a mandatory injunction to print his two statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.476" offset="1674658">In his complaint, Mr. Tornillo alleged that by this Florida statute, Florida had established “a fairness doctrine” in enacting this compulsory publication statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.639" offset="1727321">At Mr. Tornillo’s request an emergency hearing was held in the next day, October 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.965" offset="1752607">The Florida Attorney General was present, since a statute of the State's constitutionality would be questioned and he advised the Court that he would not defend the statute as he had done in prior case involving the Daytona Beach News Journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.246" offset="1817704">The Court denied Mr. Tornillo’s request for an injunction and declared the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the First Amendment and the due process guarantees of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.240" offset="1865665">Mr. Tornillo then advised the Court that he elected not to proceed further in that case and the case therefore dismissed with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.349" offset="1910178">Mr. Tornillo appealed directly to the Florida Supreme Court and on July 10 of this year in a per curiam opinion, one justice dissenting, the Florida Supreme Court reversed the lower court and held the statute did not violate either the First or the Fourteenth Amendments or the due process guarantees of the Constitution, that opinion of the Florida Court is in the appendix at page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.992" offset="2012682">A rehearing was denied in a second per curiam opinion of the Florida Supreme Court on October 10, which is also in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.719" offset="2047582">The Herald appealed directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.269" offset="2061793">On January 14, the Court agreed to hear this appeal on the merits, postponing decisions on appellee’s jurisdictional claim until the hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.585" offset="2103066">Appellee has subsequently abandoned his claim that this Court does not have jurisdiction of this appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.229" offset="2233678">Yes, I think the Florida Supreme Court said that there was no injunction remedy under the statute, but they did imply, despite the fact that it was a criminal statute, a right for civil damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.388" offset="3858286">There is a national policy that has been expressed in the First Amendment, that newspapers should not be deterred in printing what they choose particularly about political candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.116" offset="3905202">Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out in his opinion in the CBS case, the First Amendment protects newspapers from the intrusive editorial form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.804" offset="3947938">If there is any area where the role of the press under the First Amendment must remain unfettered, it is criticism of political candidates of the very kind expressed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.180" offset="3993496">One of the chief roles of the press is vigorous criticism of candidates and the public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.778" offset="4019827">Newspapers historically in this country have been in the business of grinding access and particularly political ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.447" offset="4050547">Editorial discretion and judgment must mean freedom to choose what to print and what not to print.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.037" offset="4080849">As Mr. Chief Justice Burger pointed out in the Columbia Broadcasting case, editors are editing is what editors are for and editing is selection and choice of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.211" offset="4129541">The only restrains on the autonomy of the press, which this Court sanctioned in the Columbia Broadcasting case in its non-business aspect,s are the restraints imposed by its readers and by its journalistic integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.718" offset="4191608">The attempts at regulation of fairness or balance of newspapers strikes at the very core of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.968" offset="4224627">As Professor Barren concedes in his writings, it would lead to the press being treated as a public utility and licensing of the press would be the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.326" offset="4266005">There would be a return to the conditions, which led to the adoption of the First Amendment to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.420" offset="4294426">Freedom of the press, not fairness is what the First Amendment is concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.601" offset="4319190">Fairness has been left to the editors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.915" offset="4332460">As Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out in his opinion in the CBS case, fairness is too fragile a commodity to be left to the Government to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.443" offset="4374570">Although the Florida statute is vague and ambiguous, it is certainly broad in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.250" offset="4401737">It may be invoked by any candidate, who has filed for local, state or federal law office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.697" offset="4427546">In fact, it may be invoked by an incumbent public official, as soon as he qualifies for reelection and becomes a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.599" offset="4463177">It applies to any criticism of the candidate published in the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.641" offset="4479269">It is not limited to editorial criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.717" offset="4495569">It applies at the very least, to news articles, to syndicated columns, to cartoons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.161" offset="4709355">A New York Times story for example, on Florida politics, would trigger the statute and the New York Times under penalty of criminal sanctions would be required to accept replies of Florida candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.563" offset="4767033">And again, I emphasize that this statute applies without regard to the true or the falsity or the fairness of the original article, regardless of whether there was any malice involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.159" offset="4825339">In fact this statute stands the libel standards of the New York Times versus Sullivan on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.211" offset="4849580">Newspapers which publish something which is true may be required to publish a totally false reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.971" offset="4888660">As I said, statute carries criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.652" offset="4899318">The editor can be put in jail for up to a year and fined a thousand dollars in addition to the civil remedies, which have been implied by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.522" offset="4942785">Now the appellee seeks to justify this sweeping incursion on the First Amendment on the ground that the state has an interest in fair elections and that this justifies abridgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.329" offset="4998060">We submit that such an argument ignores this Court’s holding in Mills versus Alabama, which interestingly is not cited in the Florida Supreme Court opinion or in the appellee’s briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.389" offset="5042260">In the Mills case, it was argued in defense of that Alabama statute that purity of elections, justified this ever so slight, abridgment of the First Amendment made by the statute, not to publish any critical of a candidate on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.207" offset="5113626">Nevertheless the court struck that statute down on the ground that the state's interest in fair elections could not justify an abridgment of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.129" offset="5161273">Secondly, we are told by appellee that the statute is justified by the economic concentration of the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.731" offset="5187709">However, there is nothing in the record to justify appellee’s argument that the media is now one vast monolith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.680" offset="5219474">The facts are, that there is much more diversity in the media and in the number of media, than at the time the First Amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.393" offset="5254269">But again, the Court has found in the Associated Press case that even antitrust violations do not justify infringement of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.789" offset="5295856">Of course, the press has power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.285" offset="5305887">It’s obvious that the press has to have power to assure its editorial independence and to assure that it can fulfill its role under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.931" offset="5352490">Interestingly enough, the argument made in this case for this statute and the benefits it theoretically would provide, the statute would have exactly the opposite effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.484" offset="5402645">Newspapers, particularly small ones, with space limitations would be deterred in publishing political criticism for fear of triggering the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.788" offset="5443918">Publications for example with the distinct editorial viewpoints would have the greatest dilemma of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.581" offset="5471086">Will the 12 black newspapers, serving the black community in Florida have to give equal time to George Wallace to reply as a candidate, despite the views of the particular editor of that newspaper in the community which it serves?</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.772" offset="5535869">There are many other examples but we submit that an examination of this statute on its face dictates that the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court must be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.602" offset="7035193">Moreover, in the petition for rehearing when the same parties and amici who are here made the same argument about the criminality of the Statute 104.38, the Florida Supreme Court on page 39 in this petition for rehearing said that no criminal penalty is sought in the case sub judice, they emphasize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.924" offset="7148460">They said that very clearly on page 39 and therefore the validity vel non of the criminal penalty is not here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.459" offset="7174583">Now obviously the Court only wanted to pass upon the case before them, but they certainly prepared the way for the future in case there was a criminal proceeding because they said on the very next page, page 40 of the appendix, anticipating a criminal penalty, they said the statute is so constructed that the criminal penalty can be easily severed and deleted and still leave a complete legislative expression establishing a civil right to damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.680" offset="7295478">That language has to be read in conjunction with the second paragraph on page 39.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.677" offset="7323481">I believe these two pages of the court decision below are very fundamental to an understanding of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.024" offset="7344797">And if you look at paragraph 2 on page 39 what they talk about is the fact that what was sought by Tornillo was the publication of a reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.160" offset="7413342">That is all that is before this Court is a civil proceeding to enforce a reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.860" offset="7440196">We quite understand the reason and the drive to have this conceded as a criminal penalty in hopes in validating, but that is simply is not this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.382" offset="7482305">That is not this proceeding at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.991" offset="7500696">This statue can be justified on two very familiar propositions of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.960" offset="7536640">The first is that some regulation, some regulation of the press is permissible so long as it serves an overriding police power purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.593" offset="7611141">Along with our brief on the merits to this Court we submitted an appendix, our own appendix of a 146 pages reciting various kinds of state statutes which restrict the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.894" offset="7680313">The primary motivation in preparing that appendix which has -- collects statutes about our restricting electioneering at the post, and reporting boycotts in newspapers, and reporting the names of rape victims in newspapers and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.918" offset="7756382">The point of that was not to glory in regulation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.822" offset="7788042">It was because we thought the statute that we are defending is so much superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.110" offset="7809149">Why did we think it was so much superior because unlike the legislation that I am talking about, this statute does not detract from expression one iota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.921" offset="7852408">What it does is it adds to the realm of discretion, so that the statute has the unique feature of both responding to a police power purpose and free and fair and honest election and implementing one of the grand ideas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.380" offset="8042266">In the rich case law that has developed since this Court’s decision in New York Times against Sullivan, in 1964 for example you take the case as the go from New York Times against Sullivan to Rosenbloom against Metromedia in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.221" offset="8109662">I think you see the breakdown of an implied premise in New York Times against Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.443" offset="8134531">The case talks and I just said, I just gave the word, the case talks about the word debate and I think the assumption of this Court was that if the media are free as perhaps they should be from the specter of heavy damage suits that can put them out of business, that then we would have vigorous criticism of governmental institutions and of public issues that was finally held in result by this Court in Rosenbloom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.972" offset="8244663">However, by the time the New York Times against Sullivan fact situation was extended, first from elected public officials to non-elected public official to public figures and finally in Rosenbloom just to anyone involved in a public issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.853" offset="8308193">What happened was as this Court pointed out in its plurality opinion in Rosenbloom, the situation arose or the conclusion developed that it may not be true that debate will come merely by removing newspapers from libel -- from heavy libel suits for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.998" offset="8408712">That is why in the plurality opinion, it was suggested that damages revisited was the answer, but rather that the answer might be to allow some kind of reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.159" offset="8461375">Florida with prophetic judgment has precisely the statute geared to fulfill that purpose, to let New York Times against Sullivan live, but yet to have debate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.275" offset="9765825">Now I would like just to say a couple of other things with regard to Mr. Justice Brandeis’ opinion in Whitney against California because I really think it is terribly dispositive and helpful to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.179" offset="9829460">Mr. Justice Brandeis asked two questions and after all this is a person who himself studied the press, Mr. Justice Brandeis, the most famous of all Law Review articles is his article on The Right of Privacy in 4 Harvard Law Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.016" offset="9880764">And Mr. Justice Brandeis said two things as to why we have First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.392" offset="9902289">First of all he said we have First Amendment protection because public discussion is a political duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.628" offset="9935308">What did he mean by public discussion is a political duty?</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.325" offset="9950041">He meant that public discussion is a political duty in the sense of what we talk about today in our contemporary language as the public’s right to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.799" offset="9983896">Then he said something else which I think is equally responsive and significant in trying to ascertain the validity of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.488" offset="10014720">Mr. Justice Brandies said, “Opportunity to air supposed grievances is the path of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.636" offset="10051291">Opportunity to air supposed grievances is the path of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.508" offset="10074802">”What did he mean by that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.621" offset="10079190">I believe what he meant by that is that if we are going to have things like freedom of speech and press, if we are going to have a free society, then people have to have a sense of justice about existing institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.122" offset="10125270">He believed that if they could reach an audience that if they could -- that if we could have what this Court has always talked about, debate then our institutions, our free institution would be secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.399" offset="10170305">It seems to me that 104.38, the Florida Right of Reply Statute though permits the airing of supposed grievances, and notice how artfully Mr. Justice Brandeis wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.259" offset="10221819">He didn’t say there were legitimate grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.628" offset="10235298">He said supposed grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.492" offset="10246687">I find it shocking that the people on the other side should say well they can publish a false reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.464" offset="10270616">This Court and I have no quarrel with it has given the media that opportunity to write false replies in the sense, a false editorials rather, in the sense that we are not interested whether ultimately whether in the eye of eternity something is true or false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.816" offset="10327980">Unless we can show calculatedly that it is false first -- from our First Amendment point of view, we are not interested because we know that we are going to have hurly burly of free debate we cannot stop and pause to verify each statement but by the same law and doctrine that gives that latitude to the Miami Herald, should not Tornillo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.757" offset="10767778">I am a teacher of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.592" offset="10783138">I am supposed to know what chilling effect means whether I do or not, but in any case chilling effect comes from the Dombrowski against Pfister.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.969" offset="10820650">What was Dombrowski against Pfister all about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.925" offset="10832457">The Dombrowski against Pfister was a case with civil rights workers who wanted to engage in protection that was unquest -- an activity and expression that was unquestionably protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.156" offset="10877388">And they were faced with a situation where law enforcement people said, in effect, we will prosecute you, we don’t care whether we win or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.049" offset="10908944">We will prosecute you, we will fix your First Amendment right, so that the specter of a prison was put aside or was a threat to the implantation of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.059" offset="10960980">Is that this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.496" offset="10966727">This, the Florida Court it seems to me, has done all but any state court can do in a case that did not involve or request for from criminal sanctions to exclude the possibility of criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.382" offset="11014269">It seems to me it is that the chilling effect that was talked about in Dombrowski is a world away from the cry we have heard in this case which is that if we must give our proponent of forum we would rather say nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.996" offset="11084696">To call that chilling effect, I think we have to ask a question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.759" offset="12527804">If we exhaust the free expression rights of the American people with the property rights of those who own communication facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.363" offset="12562181">This is not to say those who own and work in such facilities do not have First Amendment rights, of course they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.367" offset="12590184">The question is, can we afford some modicum to some slight legislative aid to make the debate we have all been talking about a reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.725" offset="12635638">And it is my position that the sustaining of the statute would lead precisely to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.452" offset="12666567">Now, if the argument is that as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out, one could be presented with statutes which would raise great problems then the answer to that is this Court has said again time without number is that it is a process of constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.005" offset="12728738">It is part of the task and the obligation of constitutional adjudication to draw lines and to save the beyond this point, we will not go.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel P. S. Paul</label>
            <text syncTime="3187.486" offset="12826645">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.242" offset="12841691">Just briefly, I would like to clear up two misstatements by Professor Barron in reference to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.905" offset="12868336">He refers to the statute as applying only to criticism published in a newspaper published in the same community where the candidate is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.757" offset="12903758">There is no such limitation in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.454" offset="12914521">As I said it would apply to the New York Times if it happens to publish something about a particular Florida election and the candidates involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.866" offset="12952242">And it is not correct to say that the criminal penalty can be detached from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.444" offset="12982544">The Florida Supreme Court has let the criminal penalty standing, but there is no way that any candidate can get a reply under this statute by any other way than the criminal penalty because the Florida Supreme Court has knocked out the mandatory injunction penalty, on the old common law theory that equity will enjoin a crime, a rule which is followed in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.311" offset="13073972">So without the criminal penalty this would not provoke any reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.737" offset="13099677">Mr. Barron keeps talking about Mr. Tornillo being censored but there is absolutely nothing in this record to support any such assertion that Mr. Tornillo did not get his message across.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.223" offset="13149623">Mr. Barron describes Mr. Tornillo as a public figure and as a controversial man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.290" offset="13173864">We would have to be very naive to think that Mr. Tornillo was relying entirely on a paragraph statement in the Miami Herald in order to get his message across in his campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.346" offset="13218168">There is nothing that shows that he was muzzled, but I think de novo it comes down to the concluding remarks that Professor Barron made when he says that this case poses compete -- competing First Amendment interest in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.606" offset="13275220">There are no competing First Amendment interests in conflict here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.099" offset="13293192">There is no First Amendment right to use the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.713" offset="13315553">There is no right of a citizen to be interviewed by the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.462" offset="13334570">There is no right to have a letter that a citizen may write to the press to have that letter printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.055" offset="13364976">As Mr. Justice Stewart pointed it out yesterday in the prison cases, the editor might just as well throw that letter in the waste basket if he determines that he does not desire to print it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.080" offset="13409071">A judicial inquiry into the editorial discretion and the editorial function is not permissible under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.257" offset="13445747">Compulsion is the same as censorship and there is no difference between saying that you shall publish and you shall not publish under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.029" offset="13484826">As Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed it out, our founding fathers in writing the First Amendment opted for a free press, not a fair press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.657" offset="13515337">They decided fairness was too fragile an issue for them to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.098" offset="13533100">It is the only First Amendment we have as pointed it out in the Columbia Broadcasting case and it is not the function of the Court to rewrite that Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.039" offset="13568940">The issue is really who decides what gets in to the newspaper?</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.792" offset="13587958">The government, the Florida Legislature or the editor of the free newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.203" offset="13613558">There is no constitutional right for the Florida legislature to regulate the fairness of political criticism without violating the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.264" offset="13657757">I understand that Professor Barron says this is a noble concept, but motherhood is, as one editor pointed out, also a noble condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.937" offset="13684506">But motherhood under compulsion is the product of rape and it begets illegitimacy and to force an editor to print in his editorial judgment what he does not desire and his conscience does not wish to print or he may think is not true is a clear violation of the First Amendment.</text>
