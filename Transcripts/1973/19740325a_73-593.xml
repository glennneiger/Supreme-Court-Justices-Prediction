            <text syncTime="26.947" offset="184529">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.115" offset="201247">Central Tablet Manufacturing Company versus the United States is an income tax case arising under Section 337 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.009" offset="248790">Section 337 provides in substance that sales or exchanges by a corporation within a 12-month period following adoption of a plan of liquidation shall be free from tax to the corporation provided that during the same 12-month period, all of the assets of the corporation are conveyed or transferred to stockholders in liquidation of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.230" offset="373656">Section 337 is a remedial statute enacted in 1954 to eliminate the need for determining in the course of a corporate liquidation whether assets are sold by the corporation or whether instead, they are sold to stockholders following distribution of the assets to the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.278" offset="481907">By eliminating this determination, the statue eliminates the tax on both the corporation and the stockholders with the same sale or exchange transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.574" offset="547004">In the series of lower court decision’s following the enactment of 337, it was held that involuntary conversions by a casualty ought to be included within the term sales or exchanges as used in Section 337.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.008" offset="624744">These decisions were subsequently acquiesced in by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.698" offset="651494">The new question presented here by Central Tablet is whether in the application of Section 337 to involuntary conversions by a casualty, the involuntary conversion occurs at the time of the casualty, which in this case Central Tablet preceded adoption of a plan of liquidation or whether it occurs on the right to insurance proceeds arises which under the facts of Central Tablet occurred after adoption of the plan of liquidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.603" offset="855144">I think in response to your question in trying to state it fairly, I think the very fact that we negotiate these insurance claims was a recognition tacitly on the part of the insurance carriers that there was some liability, but they neither admitted nor disallowed liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.429" offset="1302465">Frankly, I don’t recall the figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.978" offset="1312705">The biggest dispute with regard to the building policy was whether or not a coinsurance clause applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.093" offset="1341127">The insurers took the position that it, did had it applied or if it did apply, it reduced the limit of coverage approximately 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.244" offset="1385744">Now this, like every other factual issue that we got into and of course the negotiations was never determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.952" offset="1420539">What finally happened is we started to talk in terms of numbers and agreed on a dollar amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.908" offset="1448333">But in addition to this, of course there was the usual question of the value of the building at the time of the loss, with regard to the personal property that was a question of a value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.280" offset="1497861">Of course, at the time of the loss, there was a question of whether some of the personal property was repairable.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.439" offset="1522521">There was even a question with regard with part of the machinery and equipment, whether the damage to it had been caused by the fire and the water that had been used to put out the fire, or whether instead it had been caused by the elements and the failure of the insurer to properly take care of that equipment after the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.307" offset="1606008">This was not a great bone of contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.227" offset="1617607">And I don’t -- I can’t tell you how many percentage-wise the number of machines it involved, but it was a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.511" offset="1650834">Here again, it was never sudden.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.210" offset="1657626">It was never decided that the insurer was or was not at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.352" offset="1674136">We finally agreed on numbers and on dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.175" offset="1689496">The negotiations of these claims took some two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.750" offset="1711752">The building claim took approximately nine months to reach a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.016" offset="1736829">Settlement was after adoption of the plan of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.795" offset="1755951">The personal property tax claims were settled approximately a year after the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.804" offset="1783954">The business interruption loss claim, which is not here in contention, was two years after the fire before it was -- before it was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.592" offset="1831079">But the length of the negotiations were lengthy as indicated by that time span and they were quite intense, and there were a number of questions that arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.052" offset="1872980">And to repeat my statement on answering your question before, there was never any admission of liability on the part of the insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.495" offset="1906730">Neither did they specifically deny it except that they did reject our proofs of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.256" offset="1941734">The question that’s raised by Central Tablet was of course raised for the first time in the case of United States v. Morton, an Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision decided in 1968 in which Morton which the Court of Appeals in the Eight Circuit held that insurance proceeds received after adoption of the plan of liquidation as a result of a fire occurring before that plan of liquidation were entitled of a Non-recognition Provisions of Section 337.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.760" offset="2075794">The Circuit of Appeals judgment in this case in Central Tablet is of course directly in conflict with Morton.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.837" offset="2108082">It also conflicts with Kinney v. the United States, which is a District Court case in California which held that in that case, the acceptance by the insurance carriers on the insured’s proof of loss was the time for the completion of the involuntary conversion by casualty and the Court further held that Section 337 applied to that case, and that the taxpayer was there too entitled to the remedial provisions of Section 337.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.864" offset="2264189">Despite Morton and Kinney, of course, the Court of Appeals in this case as held that for the purposes of the application of Section 337 an involuntary conversion by casualty occurs in every case at the time of the casualty because this is the position of the Government here.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.731" offset="2347677">It’s the position of the Government that an involuntary conversion by casualty is a single destructive act.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.864" offset="2384248">It’s the contrary position of Central Tablet that and involuntary conversion by casualty is not a single destructive act but is instead a transaction which is complete for the purpose of the application for 337 when an unenforceable right to insurance proceeds arises, that’s our further position that under the facts of Central Tablet, that occurred when the insurance carriers accepted our proofs of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.291" offset="2525936">This of course is exertedly occurred following adoption of the plan of liquidation in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.978" offset="3796637">And I think when you analyze those condemnation cases against this involuntary conversion by casualty, you will see that the take is the significant part in the condemnation case because it is at that time that the right to compensation arises, and that’s the basis of holding that it’s the time of taking that a condemnation occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.323" offset="3906038">If you look at the similar event, an involuntary conversion by casualty, I believe you have to come to the conclusion that that’s going to be comparatively when the right to insurance proceeds arises.</text>
