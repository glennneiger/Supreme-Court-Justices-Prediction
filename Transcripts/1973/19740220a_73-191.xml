            <text syncTime="3.410" offset="90384">We’ll resume arguments in Village of Belle Terre against Boraas.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.031" offset="116924">Mr. Gegan, I think you have about 10 minutes remaining all together.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_e_gegan" startTime="14.552" stopTime="42.585">
            <label>Mr. Bernard E. Gegan</label>
            <text syncTime="14.552" offset="135001">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.152" offset="153391">Yesterday, I had tried to make two basic points.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.259" offset="169796">First, the general proposition that the village has a legitimate interest, being zoned as a one-family community, a legitimate interest in imposing some kind of limit on a number of unrelated people who may aggregate together under the roof of one private residence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="42.585" stopTime="44.673">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="42.585" offset="247118">That is two, as I understand it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_e_gegan" startTime="44.673" stopTime="350.295">
            <label>Mr. Bernard E. Gegan</label>
            <text syncTime="44.673" offset="255478">That is the particular figure set by the village, Your Honor, and yet, at the same time, an equally legitimate interest in not imposing the same kind of numerical limit on the occupancy of a traditional family.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.979" offset="312633">That’s the basic principle, but as Mr. Justice Douglas said, our village has a limit of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.818" offset="340010">Additional public purposes are particularly relevant to the number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.371" offset="370207">The legitimate interest of the village in equalizing the competitive position of families seeking to rent a residence with an aggregation of unrelated individuals seeking to rent a residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.844" offset="428095">Families have usually one income, perhaps two incomes.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.318" offset="450038">Whereas, a group of unrelated individuals, each eating separate -- leading separate lives can have a pooling of far greater financial resources and could easily bid a family out of any market to occupy a residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.294" offset="533943">The case of Dandridge against Williams turned in part on a similar consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.812" offset="559961">The ceiling in that case, put on aid to families with dependent children, was justified by a parity between what a welfare family would be earning and what a wage-earning family would be earning.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.041" offset="632895">Indeed, this is an easier case than Dandridge, because in Dandridge the classification placed at a disadvantage the under-privileged group whereas in our case the classification seeks to benefit and give a break and a parity to the entity that would otherwise be at a disadvantage, namely the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.228" offset="729652">This seems obvious to us, yet the plaintiffs have suggested that this is not a real concern of the village, that it’s a fictitious, a spurious concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.972" offset="780643">I don’t know where they get their crystal ball to make such an assertion, but I’m here to tell you that the village has a legitimate and real governmental concern with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.401" offset="830380">We are 15 minutes from the State University at Stony Brook which has a potential of thousands of unrelated people.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.468" offset="870609">The exact figure at Stony Brook is not in the record, but it’s a matter of public record so it could be judicially noticed, over 12,000 students are at Stony Brook.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.239" offset="921704">Several -- a few houses in the immediate neighborhood of the Dickman house have already been rented at about $350 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.292" offset="961933">The Dickman house, which is rented to the group of students, rents at $500 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.257" offset="985757">The disparity is there, and under the law of supply and demand, houses that are not presently on the rental market can come on the rental market once it is seen that we have an abundant demand on the part of unrelated people who are willing to pay plenty to occupy a one-family residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.040" offset="1080947">The last major public purpose underlying this ordinance is the community’s legitimate interest in stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.363" offset="1122220">If it may reasonably be thought that groups of unrelated people tend to be more transient and provide a less stable community, then it seems to us that a one-family zone limited primarily to families and small twosomes of unrelated people promote this additional legitimate interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.943" offset="1236532">Indeed, on the point of stability, one need only look at the record in this case, appendix page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.350" offset="1278119">The plaintiffs’ own allegations were that it was never planned that these students would be permanent residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.921" offset="1312392">Two of them were on the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.023" offset="1324826">Four of them were not on the lease, and it was contemplated that they would come and go.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.961" offset="1348545">The only constant thing was that the total would remain at six.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.105" offset="1373205">So, this is clearly a more transient situation than family occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.869" offset="1400268">The plaintiffs say that we live in a mobile society and even families move, and they cite some figures, but those are gross figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.460" offset="1438616">They don’t give a breakdown as between families, non-families, people who rent, people who own.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.009" offset="1464738">Your Honor, I’d like to reserve a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.016" offset="1472784">If may, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.678" offset="1503504">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.195" offset="1517505">The Belle Terre Ordinance which is challenged here and which was invalidated by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals below is, in many respects, an extraordinary piece of municipal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.187" offset="1561496">It’s important at the outset, I think, to recognize what the Belle Terre Ordinance is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.203" offset="1581558">It is not an ordinance of the kind which this Court validated in its sweeping decision in Euclid versus Ambler, and it is not in like fashion an ordinance of the character which has received widespread acceptance a tradition of comprehensive local zoning as taken hold in this country as a result of this Court’s Euclid decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.332" offset="1658044">It is different because it in no sense, purports to segregate incompatible physical uses of land or to encourage the productive use of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.581" offset="1695033">What this ordinance does in its substantial purpose, in its operative criterion, and in its effect is to exclude persons who are regarded as uncongenial from a community, and exclude them not merely on the basis of a random criterion of uncongeniality, but on the basis of a criterion of deeply personal choice, namely a person’s choice of household associates.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.633" offset="2035252">In the situation involving a boarding house, it’s entirely possible in most communities that there would be substantial legitimate governmental interests justifying the prohibition of a boarding house.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Sager</label>
            <text syncTime="516.303" offset="2141936">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.765" offset="2143817">This was the point made by Justice Rehnquist in argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.499" offset="2162730">It’s interesting to note, however, if you refer to the appellants’ brief in this case at page 30, the appellants give their explanation for permitting an unrelated household of two persons, and that explanation makes it perfectly plain that they regard this as a grudging exception which violates their basic policy of excluding unrelated persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.076" offset="2249038">Their rationale expressed on page 30, in essence, runs as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.988" offset="2264712">We recognize that, says the village, that there may be some single persons who own a house in Belle Terre by themselves and we think it would be unjust to make them move, and we’re concerned that they may be lonely and so we permit them to have one associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.865" offset="2328242">Now, I don’t criticize the policy, let me make clear, of allowing two unrelated persons, but I do want to make it perfectly plain that the village by its own description, of its reason for this exception to the exclusion of single families, does not purport to be saying “yes, we in fact like single -- a traditional -- untraditional household groups, but we want to regulate their size,” rather, it says “we want to keep unrelated persons who form households of such persons out of this community, but we realize the equities become so great in some situations that we make an exception.”</text>
            <text syncTime="596.387" offset="2462302">That’s the village’s own characterization of that, accepting, Your Honor, not mine.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.066" offset="2477035">Mr. Sager, I’m not sure I attract your response to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question, but let me try another one that might be somewhat like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.168" offset="2509427">What about a fraternity house?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_sager" startTime="610.869" stopTime="648.253">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Sager</label>
            <text syncTime="610.869" offset="2520189">Again, Your Honor, I think that the question in each instance would be at a minimum as in any governmental classification which deprives a given group of people of a substantial benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.667" offset="2567419">Is there a legitimate interest which substantiates or supports or justifies this classification?</text>
            <text syncTime="628.454" offset="2590616">I think in the case of a fraternity house, in many communities there might indeed be such legitimate interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.147" offset="2617365">There might be serious concerns about the supply of parking, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.152" offset="2633352">There might be other legitimate concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.757" offset="2643801">Where those concerns existed, our quarrel with such legislation would largely cease.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="648.253" offset="2669714">But why wouldn’t there be serious concerns about parking here, where you have six individuals in a house and, very likely, each of the six might have their own car?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Sager</label>
            <text syncTime="659.535" offset="2714854">In this instance, Your Honor, there are several important reasons, I think, for believing that this ordinance does not rationally advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.074" offset="2745051">First, that this ordinance does not advance any such concern and, secondly, that the village has no such concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.257" offset="2769816">If I can start with the second half of that argument, this village has 220 homes distributed over an area of more than a square-mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.623" offset="2807223">The present density of population in the village of Belle Terre is 1.1 persons per Acre, an extraordinary low density.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.361" offset="2838152">Parking by the village ordinance, which we cite to this Court, I believe at page 53 of our brief, parking by virtue of the village ordinance is prevented on any street of the village.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.567" offset="2891024">At this time, there are no cars parked on the streets of the village.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.659" offset="4715416">Let me say that, and make perfectly clear because I think the argument of the appellants here has been a little misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.311" offset="4753972">This ordinance has been justified below and justified in the brief by the appellants here on two very different kinds of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.512" offset="4786782">And, it’s critical I think to separate out those grounds and to delineate the two different positions that, as appellees, we take to each of those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.379" offset="4822309">On the one hand, the village has candidly acknowledged that it intended, as it clearly must have when it passed this ordinance, to project into law the social preferences of the residents of the village of Belle Terre for a socially homogeneous community, for a community in which neighboring households would be exclude -- would be comprised exclusively of traditional families, and on the other hand, the community has argued that very much more orthodox interests such as density of population, transiency of population, and red level support this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.522" offset="4974864">Now, as to the former we claim, and I believe that this is the crux of the case, that it is simply not a legitimate interest of government to divide this society into socially homogeneous residential enclaves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.822" offset="7356082">And, the Court of Appeals concurred in that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.796" offset="7367889">There is a -- there is a substantial analytical disparity between the position of the District Judge and the majority below, but the one thing they had in common was a complete and comfortable rejection of the view that these more orthodox interests of government could be the basis for justifying this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.704" offset="7435598">Their discrepancy was in the District Judge’s perception that the interest in having families and in having family organization was a justifiable interest, and the Court of Appeals concluding that that had no place in a – in a unit or subdivision of government and that, I think, is the crux of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.939" offset="7512503">I think it’s critical to examine the more orthodox or traditional interests which are proffered, but critical to examine them only to realize that they are indeed after the fact rationalizations of an ordinance which should rise or fall on very different constitutional grounds, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.144" offset="7581362">I think with the aid of your questioning, I addressed two of the governmental interests which the village has advanced, namely density, where I’ve tried to show that the community has no density problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.534" offset="8274860">I think it’s also important to note that the number “two” not merely is unusually low in this regard and, therefore, makes the ordinance in some sense less rational.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.899" offset="8820297">The census data which seeks to indicate that families are on the average, larger than unrelated households is -- could be misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.262" offset="8865750">The Bureau of the Census, which incidentally defines family in terms of blood, marriage, and adoption, defines household to include single people living alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.409" offset="8922384">So, of course, the average household being weighted with single people will be low.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.145" offset="8957283">So, it’s not fair to compare it with families which begin with two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.598" offset="8987167">I again wish to say that, to the extent that the one family-zoning ordinance embodies both the physical benefits and the social well-being of family organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.309" offset="9209940">Well, if that’s not the end of one-family zoning, I don’t know what is, and it certainly has nothing to do with keeping out undesirables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.492" offset="9242749">And, my last point is that while some families may be larger, some families may even have a servant, whereas, a group of three spinsters may be small.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.327" offset="9286008">Euclid against Ambler itself said that uses, whether it’s a boarding house, a fraternity house, or a private residence occupied by a group of individuals, uses tend to fade into each other by imperceptible gradations, and that does not put the stamp of invalidity on a zoning ordinance which seeks to draw some reasonable line based on the average family.</text>
