            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="43.101" offset="249104">Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.566" offset="266971">The issue here is a propriety under Section 718 of the 1972 School Aid Act or under the Fourteenth Amendment and the related jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Act statutes and the reversal by the Fourth Circuit of the District Court’s award of counsel fees for petitioners’ successful efforts in obtaining an injunction which required the Richmond School Board to adhere to its constitutional and statutory duty to desegregate its public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.813" offset="412003">The issue tendered here predates and has nothing whatsoever to do with the subsequent Richmond area school case which this Court heard last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.981" offset="452650">Petitioners here are Black school children and their parents who live in Richmond and who were required to return to the District Court on March 10, 1970 to force respondents to adopt an effective desegregation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.669" offset="515448">I say “required” because on May 30, 1966, after five years of litigation, the school board had proposed and the District Court had ordered a freedom of choice plan for the 1966 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.466" offset="582635">Such plan, however, specifically provided and I call your attention to page 23 of the record that if such plan did not produce sufficient results -- significant results during the 1966-1967 school year, it would have to be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.932" offset="656509">The plan also provided for desegregation of the school faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.464" offset="674586">Moreover, on May 26, 1968, this Court decided Greene which held that freedom of choice plans which did not result in a unitary school system were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.067" offset="729025">The schools in Richmond, both pupils and faculty, however, despite the 1966 plan and despite Greene, remained non-unitary, respondents did nothing whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.309" offset="778031">So, finally, on March 10, 1970, petitioners were forced to move in the District Court for further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.455" offset="806557">The motion included a request for counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.655" offset="819409">The motion, after extensive litigation resulted in the school desegregation order of April 5, 1971, incidentally is the order under which the schools in Richmond are now being operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.828" offset="876042">The school -- the District Court then, as part of the equitable relief, awarded counsel fees for petitioners of $43,000 and costs of $13,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.771" offset="931840">Before making this award, the District Court determined that, on the record before it, the award was justified by respondent's conduct both in making necessary petitioners’ 1970 reopening of the case and in the course of the litigation thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.383" offset="1010312">Ultimately, the court held that the fee award was justified by the fact that petitioners had acted as private attorneys general in securing respondent's compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment and such award was required to give complete and effective equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.824" offset="1084082">For a moment, I would like to call the Court’s attention to the findings of fact from which the District Court order was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.089" offset="1113130">At page 133a of the record, the court found that since 1968, at the latest, the School Board was clearly in default of its constitutional duties to take steps which would result in a unitary school system that, when brought into court, even though the School Board admitted noncompliance, it put petitioners to the effort of showing that governmental action was behind the segregated school attendants prevailing in Richmond, that’s at page 115a of the record and page 133a of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.679" offset="1259416">The Trial Judge further found that respondents would take no steps whatsoever to end segregation in Richmond unless and until sued by petitioners and then, only as ordered by the District Court, and that’s the finding on page 133a of the record and 134a of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.916" offset="1344366">The counsel fee award was based in part upon these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.062" offset="1360980">Thus, we do not understand the observation of the Fourth Circuit, on page 167a of the record, that the District Court does not seem to have based its award on the inaction of the School Board prior to March 10, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.143" offset="1421270">The District Court also found that the first two plans of desegregation which were filed by respondents as a result of the court order were clearly deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.485" offset="1458678">That finding is on page 117a -- 116a of the record and that two out of the three subsequent plans filed by the respondents were clearly deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.555" offset="1499011">Thus, time and effort was spent by petitioners in demonstrating the invalidity of the proposed plans until, finally, the court accepted plan 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.863" offset="1540180">Finally, and this finding I think is quite important, the District Court found that the character of school desegregation cases by 1970 and 1971 had become such that full and appropriate equitable relief should include the award of expenses of litigation, that finding, sir, is made on page 137a of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.363" offset="1634220">And that counsel of great expertise was needed to aid the court, and that finding is on page 141a of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.547" offset="1666926">The Court of Appeals, nevertheless, reversed the award of counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.083" offset="1685107">Petitioners submit that there are five separate and distinct legal grounds, each of which required that the judgment of the District Court be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.295" offset="1741949">First, this Court’s decision in the Mills case and in the Hall case, cited on pages 21 and 23 of our record -- of our brief, permit legal fees to be awarded because petitioners’ actions benefited and ascertainable class, namely, the school -- all of the school children in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.018" offset="1836826">Second, petitioners are entitled to counsel fees because they acted as private attorney general in bringing this action which vindicated important constitutional and constitutional -- and congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.289" offset="1897953">Third, Section 718 of the School Aid Act of 1972 which we cite on page -- which we set forth in page 8 of our brief, enacted while this case was pending on appeal, expressly requires the award of counsel fees in school desegregation litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.314" offset="1974021">Fourth, it was within the discretion of the District Court, sitting as a Court of Equity to award counsel fees as necessary to ford full complete equitable relief in this particular school desegregation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.011" offset="2040790">And, finally, the legal fees here were required by the District Court’s findings supported by the record that the respondents unreasonably -- acted unreasonably in refusing to desegregate voluntarily, the Richmond schools system and he persistently proposing a series of unworkable desegregation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.508" offset="2126785">It should be noted that only the fifth ground requires consideration of whether, as the District Court found, respondents’ conduct was unreasonably obstinate.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.581" offset="2175060">Mr. Coleman, I realize you’re not relying exclusively on the 1972 Act by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.335" offset="2222080">I suppose had a final order been entered here prior to the enactment of that statute, that ground would’ve been taken away, wouldn’t it?</text>

            <text syncTime="550.827" offset="2280072">If what you’re saying by final order, Your Honor, that the award of counsel fees had been denied, an appeal was taken, and that was denied and thereafter, Congress enacted a statute and, clearly that statute would not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.044" offset="2344960">You could not go back and reopen the litigation on the counsel fees.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="587.154" offset="2425313">Is the statute capable of being applied to services rendered after its effective date?</text>
            <text syncTime="594.245" offset="2453734">I take it your position is that it applies to all circumstances as long as the statute is applicable?</text>

            <text syncTime="602.983" offset="2488633">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.583" offset="2491037">Well, why don’t I go right to Section 718?</text>
            <text syncTime="607.163" offset="2505352">It’s on page 8 of our brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.434" offset="2518518">As we understand it, Section 18 says that where there is a final order to desegregate the schools and there’s a finding of fact that proceedings were necessary to bring about the compliance, then the court may award counsel fees to the prevailing party, that statute was enacted on either June or July 27, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.397" offset="2622380">It was enacted while the case was pending on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.701" offset="2643592">There is nothing in that statute which says it’s not to apply to existing litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.249" offset="2673789">As we read your decision, particularly for US Alabama, the one thing [Attempt to Laughter] that’s clear is that where you have a statute which does not, by its term, restrict itself to future events, that statute pertains to pending litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.724" offset="2851631">And then, while the case was pending on appeal, the statute changed to 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.525" offset="2878798">Now, is it your argument that the 6% would apply to all of the services that had been performed prior to the change?</text>

            <text syncTime="722.203" offset="2965525">I mean, this case, Your Honor, you have to overrule 10-12 cases before you could say that this statute would not be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.237" offset="2997708">Now, the only thing that the respondents said, the only argument he has because the statute has an effective date which says in respect of July 1, 1972, but obviously that was before the case was decided by the Fourth Circuit, before you heard the case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.557" offset="3074926">To the extent that there is legislative history, my understanding of the law, Your Honor, is if the legislative history is neutral, then clearly the rule of thought applies, to the extent that there is legislative history, the only legislative history that you can find here is that, at one time, the Bill specifically provided that it would only be applicable to legal services performed after the effective date of the Act, that was then deleted from the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.040" offset="3188924">Now, to the extent that there’s any legislation, that’s it and also, and I will be finished with this report, Your Honor, if you recall in Goldstein versus California which was decided last term, Mr. Chief Justice when you wrote the opinion for the Court, you spent two paragraphs completely twice quoting language which showed Congress there intended specifically only to apply the statute in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.148" offset="3305326">And, it was clear that but for that specific language, you then would apply that statute to the action that already took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.019" offset="3336777">And not only under 718, Your Honor, do I think that this case has to be reversed and the order of the District Court reinstated, but under your decision in Hall where you said that, there, there was simply a congressional statute which said that if an employee, if a member of the labor union was kicked out of the Union, he could sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.825" offset="3468016">That you indicated there that part of the relief since what he did was an ascertainable class, part of the relief could be the reward of counsel fee and, once again, the District Court awarded the counsel fee and the sole issue was whether you should upset it.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.074" offset="3525068">The issue is not here whether if they had not awarded the counsel fee, what would be the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.457" offset="3542622">Here, you have a case where the court did exercise the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.313" offset="3557982">In addition, the cases make it clear that where the petitioner acts as a private attorney general, he’s entitled to counsel fee as part of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.350" offset="3610122">And the one thing is clear and it’s contrary that private persons were forced to bring lawsuits to vindicate constitutional rights which resulted in the desegregation of public schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.642" offset="3687340">There are other cases which say that where it happens and the government, here in its amicus brief, freely concedes that it just did not and could not bring the litigation which resulted in the desegregation of public school and under those circumstances, we certainly were vindicating the rights of a private person.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.670" offset="3779396">Now, as I understand the respondent’s brief, he pretty much concedes that if you read Mills, if you read Hall, if you read the private attorney general’s cases that clearly the law should be, that under those circumstances the Black petitioners were entitled to counsel fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.558" offset="3850971">But he says that because Congress has now passed Section 718, for some reason, you forget the one group of people that stood in the trenches, that took the risk that supplied the legal talent to change the society peacefully and by the use of law rather than by being in the street and somehow, they should be penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.099" offset="3937176">We also think that some urge in the government’s position that the best thing here for the court, for all courts, is to award the fee under the basis of the Hall case of the private attorney general because the District Courts and, frankly, we don’t like to be in litigation with School Boards as to whether they were obstinate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.906" offset="4020349">Now, if you really want to have a lot of litigation, that’s the only rule you would go for, but if you’d go for the Hall rule or the Mills rule or if you apply Section 718, then you don’t have this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.750" offset="4075729">Now, on the being obstinate, I think the findings of that and if Rule 52 needs anything, I think you have to carryout the rule of the finding of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.626" offset="4115226">After all, it was Judge Marriage who dealt day and day with the litigants, day in and day out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.678" offset="4139468">He was the one that knew nuances of how cooperative you’ve been, the things which you just can’t put in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.756" offset="4163814">And, he was the one that made the determination that based upon everything that had happened before him, he felt the award should be made on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.738" offset="4195683">He also was the one, and I think you ought to give some weight to the experiences of these great federal district judges that have really worked this problem out locally, that he was the one that having these cases and knowing cases, talk to his brother who I’m pretty sure, realized that the effort involved in bringing this type of litigation requires there to be competent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.625" offset="4287216">Counsel has to be skilled, a counsel has to spend a lot of time and since that you are defending the public here, that for that reason you ought to award the counsel fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.944" offset="4340506">I think Brown number two, if it teaches anything, it teaches that in this type of litigation that sometimes the rights of the individual have to be subordinated to the rights of the entire group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.393" offset="4390348">And that clearly, by bringing in litigation and having a class action, you are functioning to change the whole society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.326" offset="4422008">And, if the cases which we cite in our brief have any significance at all, it is clear that in this instance that you ought to indicate that there is -- that we were functioning as a private or Mr. Greenberg and the other people who had nothing to do with the case were functioning as private attorney generals and on that basis, you should reinstate the order of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.388" offset="4514273">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. George B. Little</label>
            <text syncTime="1119.919" offset="4556382">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.753" offset="4571742">The issues could be narrowed very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.754" offset="4587729">We take no issue with the fundamental sounds of the rationale advanced by this Court in Mills, in Newman versus Piggie Park, in Hall v. Cole, and cognate cases, but we must question the applicability of the rationale of those cases to pre-Swan school desegregation litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.980" offset="4704653">Accordingly, we take the position that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed since the unique nature of pre-Swan school desegregation litigation renders the traditional equitable standard of overt obstinacy entirely appropriate for litigation in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.964" offset="4828578">That, the record fully exonerates the District Court’s findings with respect to the conduct of this Board and for the reason that Section 718 does not reach services concluded more in 17 months prior to the effective date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.863" offset="4920216">By way of an overview to reach our position, we must go back to 1970, that is the area of time involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.535" offset="4974864">We can gain a proper perspective to determine what is a proper standard to measure the conduct of the Board, with respect to pre-Swan litigation, through a very brief review of the actual, factual realities confronting the Richmond School Board, the precise issue that gave rise to all of this litigation and a very brief review of the state of the law as it then applied, particularly to the issue involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.995" offset="5112686">The dilemma confronting the Richmond School Board at the time of the filing for motion for further relief on March 10, 1970 prior to Swan is very easy to describe to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.555" offset="5170991">We had a large metropolitan system, majority Black, characterized 99% by marked residentially segregated neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.577" offset="5239014">The first plan submitted by the School Board based entirely on the efforts of HEW, they prepared the plan, the first plan which was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.152" offset="5289378">The principal deficiency in that plan was the failure of HEW, and I’m not saying it’s their responsibility, it’s the School Board’s responsibility, but in drawing the plan, they refused to use transportation over and above what was then being done in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.400" offset="5370358">Every bit of the litigation from that point on narrowed down to even a much more restricted aspect of the transportation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.682" offset="5415497">Now, this is in the summer of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.944" offset="5432529">Specifically, the issue narrowed down as fine as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.170" offset="5449456">The necessity for buying buses to alter the racial composition of 19 elementary schools because the interim plan, that was approved by Judge Marriage, which was the second plan submitted, did the job at the high school level, at the middle school level, and at the elementary level with the exception of these 19 schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.810" offset="5556036">Twelve, more than 90% Black on one side of town and seven, more than 90% White on the other side of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.756" offset="5595742">The racial composition of these 19 schools was the major deficiency which the court found in the interim plan which was implemented in September 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.189" offset="5657496">It formed the basis for the plaintiffs’ motion for mid-year implementation of additional relief beginning in January of 1971 which the lower court denied and it was the reason why Judge Marriage ordered further relief on April 5, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.653" offset="5739311">Now, on this issue, there was no disagreement that the only way these 19 schools could be desegregated was by the extensive cross down transportation of elementary-aged children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.094" offset="5793123">It was also agreed, Richmond had never operated a transportation system with the exception of, I think, eight buses used in special education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.985" offset="5832725">And, that public transportation was not then available, the capacity to do the job, they were not disputed issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.875" offset="5868251">Now, so much for the factual dilemma; let’s come to the state of the law as it existed on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.865" offset="5912242">In the same month that the motion for further relief was filed, the Chief Justice in Northcross pointed out that whereas the objective of a unitary system non -- wherein racial discrimination did not exist, it was perfectly clear, the means were left largely unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.982" offset="6016627">Specifically, the Chief Justice mentioned one of the issues as being the extent to which transportation may or must be used, as a desegregation tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.014" offset="6076813">In Swan, this Court frankly acknowledged the enormity of the problem, the complexities of the problem as it did beginning with Brown one as it repeated in Brown two because bear in mind, school desegregation litigation set a precedent in our history of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.284" offset="6177855">It was the first time of which I am aware of that constitutionally deferred -- constitutionally declared rights had to be deferred because of the complexities of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.761" offset="6231771">Thus, it was not until May, I beg your pardon, April 20, 1971 that there was any occasion for this Court to ever have addressed itself to the metropolitan school problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.142" offset="6297287">As this Court noted in the Swan decision, it was its first effort to deal with this subject of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.308" offset="6337933">Now, what was the law in the Fourth Circuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.982" offset="6352666">Bear in mind, we lived in Virginia under the law of Briggs versus Elliott for fourteen years prior to this decision in Greene when no less a juris than John J. Parker interpreted Brown to mean that there was nothing in the constitution to require integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.323" offset="6426018">So, the light is not the dawn too early in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.920" offset="6444408">The first time that the Fourth Circuit had occasion to address either transportation or metropolitan school district where in its decisions in Swan and Brewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.257" offset="6493727">Now these decisions were both decided after the HEW plan had been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.272" offset="6517864">In other words, at the time of the preparation of the first plan that was submitted by HEW there were no guidelines from this Court or from the Fourth Circuit with respect to metropolitan school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.782" offset="6559869">Now, significantly, the District Court found that the interim plan, which we submitted within 19 days after the decision in Brewer, fully complied with the Fourth Circuit’s test of reasonableness as it then existed in the Fourth Circuit and that it represented, this is the judge’s language, a sincere effort to comply with the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.501" offset="6694766">He was not thinking in terms of bad faith at that time, that reference is 317 F. Supp. at pages 573 and 575.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.538" offset="6746906">Now, the precise issue that we were wrestling with, and the state of law with respect to that issue, provides a setting for our conclusion that the Court of Appeals did not err in applying the conditional equitable standard with respect to fees or in concluding that the Board -- that the record exonerated the Board under this status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.960" offset="6840633">The universal acknowledgment by every court in this country of the enormity and the complexity of this type of litigation prior to Swan underlies the decision and the determination by every Court of Appeals in this country which has passed on the issue that the appropriate pre-Swan standard is the traditional equitable standard of obstinacy in every suit that has been brought under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.409" offset="6974380">I don’t think we should presume that the Fourth, the Fifth, the Sixth, the Eighth, and the Ninth Circuits have been oblivious to either the vital importance of the constitutional rights being vindicated to the public benefit that has resulted or to the fact that the plaintiffs, in a very real sense, are acting as attorney generals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.503" offset="7370710">We -- the standard of the statute has been set by this Court and we have no -- in Northcross in June of this past year, we have no objection to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.038" offset="7400908">But, that addresses itself when we will come to Section 718, but I’m bringing out what the absolute uniformity has been prior to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.123" offset="7437270">Now these same factors, that is, the enormity of the problem, the complexities involved, the frequent admonition by this Court beginning with Brown two that equitable standard shall govern, and the courts construed that to mean the traditional equitable standard with respect to the award of fees, has been the basis for distinguishing this type of litigation from every other form of civil rights litigation of which I am aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.979" offset="7556702">The recognition of this distinctive nature of pre-Swan litigation has lead the Fifth Circuit, subsequent to the decisions of Hall v. Cole and Northcross by this Court, to expressly reject the reasoning of a District Court in this case and to reaffirm the traditional equitable standard of obdurate obstinacy even though, and I call the Court’s attention to this particularly, the Fifth Circuit had previously extended the Newman rationale to other civil rights actions brought under Sections 1981 and 1982, but it said not so in light of the uncertainties of the law that existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.739" offset="7755755">The rationale, why the Fifth Circuit refused to do this, is well-stated on page 29 of our brief, the blue brief, it’s a part of a quotation from Johnson versus Combs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.949" offset="7824509">This complete uncertainty of the law which has lead to this uniform adoption by all of the circuits underlies the basic fallacy in the District Court’s finding as to the conduct of this Board in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.649" offset="7895353">The basic premise that Judge Marriage used to substantiate his conduct finding was that the Richmond School Board had ignored clear legal directives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.420" offset="7946449">Such a finding, in light of what we had just reviewed as to the unsettled state of the law at that time, compelled a reversal by the Fourth Circuit on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.645" offset="7995350">As the District Court, throughout this litigation, itself had made repeated references to the unsettled state of the law at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.575" offset="8039027">Let me cite just one; eight weeks before the opinion came down finding bad conduct and clear authority -- I mean, the ignoring the clear legal authorities, this is what the District Court itself was cautioning us about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.667" offset="8107468">This was on March 4, 1971 prior to Swan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.327" offset="8130038">We were all groping, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.689" offset="8139546">We did not know what this court would ultimately do in Swan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.699" offset="8155533">The District Court said we ought to contemplate that there may be some expression in the law which would advocate neighborhood schools for children in grades one through five.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.552" offset="8202971">This was Eight weeks before his opinion of May 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.768" offset="8235781">Moreover, the District Court -- I mean, the Court of Appeals could hardly have concurred in what the judge below had singled out as the real failure of the Richmond School Board, namely, its failure to buy buses until ordered to so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.654" offset="8331389">If you will look on pages 133, 134, and 135 -- I beg your pardon, on pages 118 of the record the judge says “the School Board had in August still taken no step to acquire the necessary equipment,” he’s addressing himself to August of 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.059" offset="8537025">Now, this is what the judge thought below was about buying buses in August of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.524" offset="8562834">“It seems to me it would be completely unreasonable to force a school system that has no transportation and you don’t have any to any great extent to go out and buy new buses when the United States Supreme Court may say it is wrong.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.353" offset="8634201">Now, the District Court on three occasions, in June of 1970, in August of 1970, in January of 1971, had refused to order us to buy buses, despite the request to do so because he knew at that time that the law was unsettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.485" offset="8710687">I think, in view of time, I better move to the significant reasons why we say that Section 718 should not be applied to pre-Swan services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.251" offset="8765753">First, the Fourth and Fifth Circuits are the only two that have had occasion to rule on the applicability of Section 718 to pre-Swan services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.032" offset="8824895">Both have refused or declined to do so, to apply Section 718 to those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.374" offset="8854256">One of the grounds cited by both of the courts that the -- was that the inconclusive legislative history of Section 718, and both courts determined that the legislative history was inconclusive, did not overcome the historic presumption against the prospective operation of statutes absent, clear, and unambiguous intent to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.275" offset="8973897">Now, Mr. Justice White, we feel that that rule is perfectly consistent with the teachings of United States versus Schooner Peggy and with Thorpe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.775" offset="9023843">As Judge Winters conceded in his dissent in this case, and you’ll see on page 192, he doesn’t like this interpretation of Peggy Schooner, but he does concede that the facts in Schooner Peggy and much of the opinion deals with the effect on a change in law pending appeal, is that the proper statement of the rule is that when there is a change in law, of course, the Appellate Court is required to consider that law, that is not saying “applying it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.011" offset="9168771">It is to examine that law to try to determine whether or not it was intended to cover transactions which had transpired prior to its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.380" offset="9226240">This was exactly what this Court did in both US versus, Chief Justice Marshall did, in US versus Schooner Peggy and, I submit, what was done in Thorpe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.976" offset="9276604">Now, let’s mention Thorpe just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.113" offset="9289247">No one can deny the existence of the historic presumption of retroactivity -- I mean, against retroactivity of a congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.759" offset="9339820">We can’t agree with Judge Winters who says that Thorpe reverses that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.878" offset="9372212">In his view, once a law is changed you presume it applies to a pending case unless there is intent to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.691" offset="9407530">When you look at Thorpe, there are two things I would invite the Court’s attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.697" offset="9427487">The court there went and construed the regulation involved, the HUD regulation involved and after construing it as applying to all tenants still residing in the project, this is an ejectment suit, eviction under Housing Act, it then decided that it applied to this lady whose litigation was then in process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.452" offset="9522573">In addition, Thorpe is one of those cases that we members of the Bar have a hard time determining the proper scope of for the reason that, in Thorpe, this Court judiciously avoided a fundamental question of due process by a very reasonable interpretation of the regulation before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.520" offset="9614838">So much for the first reason for not applying Section 718, another one is well stated by the Fifth Circuit in Johnson versus Combs and I will read just a portion of the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.097" offset="9677113">It’s found on -- “to apply this statute retroactively would place a wholly unexpected and unwarranted burden on these districts who have done no more than litigate what they in good faith believe to be demands which exceeded the constitution’s demands.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.209" offset="9761541">This rationale is expanded, but time does not permit me to read any more from it, but that is the second ground that has been use as the basis for not applying Section 718 to pre-Swan services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.934" offset="9812532">And, as I’ve mentioned earlier, the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed the same standard for pre-Swan services even after the decision of this Court in Northcross and in Hall v. Cole, they did that in Henry versus Clarksdale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.277" offset="10089848">And, this brings me right to this point of another basis for not applying and that is the entry of an order of compliance, in other words, an order necessary for compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.221" offset="10125584">And, the Fourth Circuit of course said while there was no order of compliance on appeal or that was even pending at the time of the effective date of Section 718, and that is another basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.874" offset="10192248">But I think the true test, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is that how do we say that Congress, knowing that this rule of obdurate obstinacy, has prevailed uniformly throughout the country in five circuits and, how many District Courts, I don’t know, that they would come in and enact the statute intending to cover services rendered prior to its effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.132" offset="10293290">I have very great difficulty in thinking that Congress intended to bring about a lot of re-litigation because bear in mind, school desegregation suits are unique in another sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.610" offset="10351177">Adhering to the admonishments of this Court, these cases are still within the realm of pending cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.647" offset="11263373">The expansion and extension of the Doctrine of Mills and Newman and Hall v. Cole, we think, is fully appropriate to many forms of the civil rights actions which are being brought under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.601" offset="11327112">But we say that they -- such an expansion is not warranted in pre-Swan school desegregation litigation because of the complexities which necessitated the evolutionary development of remedies in school desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.753" offset="11395762">We say that this record exonerates the School Board under the obdurate obstinacy standard and certainly, would render the imposition of a stigma of bad faith unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.417" offset="11450410">Admittedly, upholding the award under Section 718 or under any other theory while more palatable would be incorrect for the reasons cited and would also create quite an inequity of subjecting these respondents, this School Board as being the only School Board in this country that is ever been held to that standard for pre-Swan litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.541" offset="11614877">In the first place, I’ve read a lot of cases of this Court and I stand -- and I don’t know of any case where you’ve used this obdurate obstinacy rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.278" offset="11669838">The obdurate obstinacy rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.271" offset="11681855">I just never heard it in any of your opinions, I’ve never read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.332" offset="11694080">Secondly, what really happened was, in several cases where the District Court for some reason denied relief, based upon the findings Court of Equity, and the issue before the Court of Appeals was whether you should reverse the District Court and that’s when this expression appeared in a couple of opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.726" offset="11783628">Thirdly, there have been very few cases that made an award and, in the Bradley case, as early, the award was $75.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.192" offset="11825528">Now, while we were or while Mr. Lucas and Mrs. Chachkin was litigating against the Richmond School Board, it so happened that the lawyer for the Richmond School Board for the same period of time received fees in excess of $86,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.680" offset="11911419">This is public money from a school system with 60% Black, 40% White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.422" offset="11942452">Clearly, the decisions of this Court have indicated that the constitutional rights of the Blacks were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.233" offset="11965649">It is only fair to be equitable when the lawsuit was finally successfully won, that those who fought the School Board ought to be compensated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.843" offset="12120085">Judge Marriage entered the order of April 5, 1971, based upon the state of law in his circuit, the Fourth Circuit, which had decided Swan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.609" offset="12387161">Sure, they had to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.875" offset="12392281">And, certainly, what you did, depending upon the local situation, the sincerity, and the sophistication of the School Board, but, what he says is if you take the law as it existed in my circuit in 1970-1971, the School Board did not discharge its functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.954" offset="12472529">And his opinion, when you read his opinion which is the order of April 5, 1971, you will find where he states “I’ve been told to hold this case until after the Supreme Court of the United States decides Swan, but I’m not going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.684" offset="12527491">I’m going to decide it on the basis of the existing law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.234" offset="12537731">So, every one of these plans he threw out, He threw out solely because it did not comply with the law of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.067" offset="12565002">He did not throw it out because he felt, that he knew that a year later you were going to decide a case where you would expand the rights of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.796" offset="12599902">Now in closing, Your Honor, on this question of the applicability of Section 718, I know that every rule about appellate arguments says one thing you don’t do is read from a court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.279" offset="12661864">But, I just would call your attention to the Thorpe case where the court says that the general rule, however, is that an Appellate Court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.284" offset="12721842">Then, in footnote 38, a change in the law between a -- apply, and appellate decision requires the Appellate Court to apply the changed law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.253" offset="12753711">Now, that is the law and as I understand the decision of this Court, unless the respondents can point to a legislative history or specific words as existed in Goldstein which says you don’t apply to pending cases, you clearly comply to the pending case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.016" offset="12828839">Now, the Fourth Circuit said that the legislative --</text>

            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3192.330" offset="12846080">Well, that’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.885" offset="12848274">Unless you -- if you were -- if there’s a grave injustice and if you talk about the presumption of Congress, which I -- I’ve never used Congress, but I always felt that it’s conceding that congressmen reads every case and knows every statute, anything he does, he knows the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.697" offset="12911491">And, therefore, that you think that those congressmen had read and knew the obstinate rule which existed in the Fourth and Fifth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.187" offset="12941479">When we read those cases, I’m pretty sure you’re convinced there is no rule, that’ the theory you’re going to go on, which I really think is, you know, it just isn’t so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.310" offset="12973976">Congressmen just don’t read all the cases and they don’t have time, but the rule which is certainly one that any legislature ought to know is that when there’s a federal statute enacted, that that statute will apply to existing cases unless Congress goes out of its way to demonstrate that that general rule is not to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.226" offset="13069688">Now, if you got to compete between which presumption you should take of Congress, I think that that has to be the presumption because that is the law in the federal cases and it seems to me, on that basis, you should apply Section718.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.337" offset="13122142">If you do it, you avoid a lot of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.613" offset="13135203">It becomes very simple and concise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.726" offset="13147638">You don’t have this problem and I can understand why a School Board would not want to be labeled with what it should be labeled as, namely, that the fact it did deny the right to these Black children and it took a lot of litigation and we finally converted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.321" offset="13202077">But, we converted them three or four years later and while we were in there and trying to convert them, I think that we’re entitled to counsel fees.</text>
