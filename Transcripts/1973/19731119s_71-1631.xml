            <text syncTime="25.226" offset="177633">The opinion I am authorized to announce this morning is in number 71-1631, Stanley P Kusper Jr. and others, appellants against Harriet G. Pontikes, appellee in a case which is here on appeals from the United States District Court for the Northern district of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.123" offset="265195">Under a provision of the Illinois Election Code a person is prohibited from voting in a primary election of a political party, if he has voted in the primary of any other party within the preceding 23 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.077" offset="329038">The appellee Harriet G. Pontikes is a qualified Chicago voter who voted in a Republican Primary in February of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.560" offset="375014">She wanted to vote in March 1972, Democratic Primary, but was bared from doing so by this 23-months rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.692" offset="415556">She filed a complain for the declaratory and injunctive relief in United State's District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that the Illinois law unconstitutionally abridged her freedom to associate with the political party of her choice by depriving her of the opportunity to vote in the Democratic Primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.345" offset="494132">A statutory, a three-judge court was convened and that Court held, one judge dissenting that the 23-months rule is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.504" offset="534779">We noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal from that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.022" offset="560797">For the reasons set out in some detail in the written opinion filed today, we conclude that this provision of Illinois Election Code unconstitutionally infringes upon the right of free political association, protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.686" offset="635507">The judgment of the District Court is accordingly affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.125" offset="653270">The Chief justice concurs in the result and I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion and that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Blackmun has joined.</text>
