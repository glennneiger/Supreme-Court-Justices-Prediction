            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="9.007" offset="112744">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.327" offset="122044">First of all, I think we left off with the Court addressing the question about or comment to the extent that this Court has from time to time allowed the State Supreme Court of the States so we can give a say in its construction to its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.301" offset="185992">We suggest of course in this instance we think that the concept of the Circuit Judge Morgan was correct that this statute is sort of straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.546" offset="222981">It says that any place that sells an alleged obscene publication by the definition of the criminal law, that’s using the criminal law definition, is declared to be and shall be a public nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.359" offset="278152">Hence, the activity is clear that what they can do is one publication offered for sale could in fact, if it’s declared to be obscene, justify the closing the entire premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.166" offset="325381">That’s what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.266" offset="329770">That’s what the statute gives them authority to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.489" offset="338756">Now, certainly we have a question of who won the race to the courthouse door.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.982" offset="352653">Well, obviously, in this context, we didn’t know and couldn’t know what’s in the mind of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.574" offset="379089">He files a civil action in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.355" offset="394136">We of course, move right into federal court taking and trying to have an election of the jurisdictional forum in which we seek to litigate our rights and if we --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="89.914" offset="436454">Are you -- are you saying Mr. Smith that it is inconceivable that the state court would say that this statute, the state statute would pass constitutional muster for them as the state’s highest court only if it were construed and not to reach anything except to obscene materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.721" offset="543660">Haven’t state courts exercise that kind of a role before?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="123.000" offset="568738">Sir, they have not generally done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.743" offset="587755">There are some states of course which I pointed out in our brief that have done so but they are statutory weren't like the statute at bar here.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.410" offset="614400">The New Riviera Arts Theater case was -- didn’t have such a statute in their jurisprudence, hence, we have one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.130" offset="641254">There was such a statute as we indicated yesterday in the matter of presume limited which the state court construed to authorize the entire shuttering of the process and of course that’s what is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.748" offset="699768">We don’t have a statute saying that the sale of that article would be a public nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.294" offset="717949">This Court addressed itself to the question in Paris Adult Theater of whether or not a procedure could be employed whereby a film or a book or anything which might be declared to be obscene in civil proceeding could not further be shown and that’s of course now the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.719" offset="779598">But here they are going on a broader attack saying we’re going to shut the entire premises because of the one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.461" offset="802586">Now, if the Court’s language in Heller and Roaden has significance in quoting Bantam Books and such that any law that necessary involves a prior restraint, comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its validity and we’re talking about that kind of law in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.294" offset="885969">As I said and it’s the extreme to which the law certainly can be applied that is obvious and patently apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.400" offset="914390">As I said before, if a department store which might offer for sale the book of Joy of Sex, if it prosecuted one or two week ago it didn’t say, okay they sold this book, hence the department store could be closed and everything there can be seized as contraband and destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.440" offset="966531">Hence the state court found that none of this material was obscene, none of those untoward offense would occur, would they?</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.490" offset="5102759">Your Honor, may it please the Court, the facts in this case are essentially that in August of 1972, the state brought a nuisance action some two months after we had a mistrial on a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.440" offset="5150511">Nuisance action was brought against Camden Road Bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.020" offset="5164826">The criminal case was against one man Chandler who we found out after we brought the civil action either lost its proprietary interest or something and Speight took over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.178" offset="5213414">Now, we set it down for rule hearing as a normal Georgia procedure in nuisance cases that was four days after the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.784" offset="5251866">On the morning that we arrived for Court after the Court had cleared its calenders for a rule hearing, where we were served with removal after we announced strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.768" offset="5287811">At that time, we repaired to the federal court on the state court’s direction and we discussed the case, both counsel with Judge Moore (ph) who drew the case when we got over there, we sought over for a three-judge panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.731" offset="5347683">Between the time that we could hear the removal action in 1983 Civil Rights Actions filed by appellants herein, they alleged that the Georgia statute 26-2101, which is our General Obscenity Statute and in that time pro Miller, it tracked Roth memoirs and it had been declared constitutional in the Fifth Circuit and was affirmed by this Court in Gable versus Jenkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.305" offset="5465966">They attacked 26-2103 which is a nuisance statute that counsel has referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.803" offset="5491984">They attacked 26-2104 which makes any material which had been found to be obscene, contraband, that is after determination, therefore we could destroy it and they attacked the entire nuisance chapters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.966" offset="5560633">Now the District Court when we went over there did not reach the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.616" offset="5583203">They decided the case with abstention, comity and federalism and sent us back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.132" offset="5605251">That’s where we are at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.419" offset="5618416">Now, it’s important to note that the rule then pending in the First Circuit as far as abstention and comity and what to do when a injunction or declaratory leave is asked against the state statute, was it federal intervention will not rest on label such as civil or criminal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.967" offset="5704620">It’s simply balancing of the competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.197" offset="5717577">The doctrine arose out of the Poile (ph) Chandler case and that’s what the Court did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.047" offset="5740983">They wanted the competing interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.246" offset="5749760">They determined that this was a quasi-criminal case and similar to Poile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.143" offset="5777345">Therefore Younger versus Harris standard should apply, but I also found that this statute had never been construed by any state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.418" offset="5810469">Therefore, abstention would be proper.</text>
