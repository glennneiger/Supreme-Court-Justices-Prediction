            <text syncTime="44.385" offset="254328">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the conviction of William Carol Huddleston for violating Title 18, United States Code, Section 922 (a) (6), which prohibits the making of a false statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed firearms dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.613" offset="351190">The basic problem in this case arises from the simple fact that Section 922 (a) (6) prohibits false statements only if they are made in connection with the acquisition of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.771" offset="403853">However, Mr. Huddleston's statements were made in connection with the redemption from pawn of three rifles which he himself had previously pawned at a pawnshop some three or four months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.692" offset="463517">That is, the statements were not made in connection with the purchase or sale of firearms by Mr. Huddleston, but rather in connection with redeeming property which he himself had brought to the pawnshop.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.972" offset="648673">Now, we believe that first of all, the use in other sections of the laws of broader terminology, such as deliver, would indicate that the term acquisition has a narrower meaning and is simply physical transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.542" offset="702903">Furthermore, we believe that Congress may well have been concerned with trades or barters which were not technically sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.055" offset="740937">And that the term acquisition must have had a narrower meaning than simply physical transfer, or they would have used the broader terminology that is used in other sections, such as simply transfer or deliver.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.949" offset="4032575">Basically what happened, I was the trial attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.620" offset="4047203">Basically what happened is the Justice Department was trying to create a lack of conflict in the Circuits by contending that this case was different in the Laisure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.793" offset="4111882">The trial judge indicated that very early in the game in the trial that we were probably going to lose and that the best thing that we ought to do is to make sure we had an appealable issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.163" offset="4161411">And therefore, as he states on page 29 of the appendix, "Mr. Saferstein, you're in a good shape right now because the pawn ticket is in Mr. Huddleston's name, and that puts you right smack-dab in Laisure."</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.162" offset="4217417">What he meant by all that was that the government was trying to distinguish Laisure by saying that in Laisure, it was the owner who had pawned the gun, whereas in our case it was an agent of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.832" offset="4260049">And he basically said, "Mr. Saferstein, I don't want to try your case for you, but you're in as good as shape as you are right now, and I wouldn't proceed any further, we're trying to show whose guns they were."</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.681" offset="4299442">So the testimony that did come out was simply that Mr. Huddleston pawned the guns, and the government only brought out the simple question that Mrs. Huddleston had bought the guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.036" offset="4340924">And under California Law in a community property state, the presumption would still be that they were co-owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.226" offset="4365688">So -- and in the Ninth Circuit, the same arguments about the distinction between who owned the gun, and whether this was under Laisure or not under the Laisure case were discussed in the Ninth Circuit except the position that they were co-owners of the guns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.219" offset="5049574">It seems to me that pawnbrokers were included in the law for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.904" offset="5068382">The testimony of Mr. Bennett before the House showed that there were a number of purchases by the people from pawnbrokers, especially the kind of purchase that Mr. Justice Stewart talked about, that is the swap, and they were also concerned I believe that pawnbrokers were often in parts of the community that had high crime rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.595" offset="5175171">And so I think they were concerned with making sure that, number one, they were licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.219" offset="5193665">They wanted them to be licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.049" offset="5200980">And number two, that their sales of guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.571" offset="5219056">Every one of the Congressman and every one of the Senators who talk about pawnbrokers, talks about their sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.986" offset="5244656">They talk about windows and displays of guns in their windows, whereupon a pawnbroker does not display in his windows the guns that he is keeping in the safekeeping for the pawnor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.505" offset="5286766">So I think they included them to include their sales, and they were fearful in light of the testimony in Mr. Cone, and the unique nature of the pawnbrokers business that they would not be included within the definition of a retail seller of guns at retail or wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.540" offset="5346952">And so I think that is an explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.417" offset="5354371">Furthermore, they may have been simply concerned with making sure they were regulated in the entirety.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.593" offset="5487073">And I think for that reason, Congress went out of its way to include pawnbrokers as a separate category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.476" offset="5510687">Now I think the primary legislative history, apart from the debates which supports our position is the Code Section cited on page 13 of our brief, Section 922 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.249" offset="5561783">This is the cornerstone of the 68 Law, 922 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.315" offset="5582054">It's this Section which prohibits any interstate shipment by a firearms dealer to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.580" offset="5607027">It simply outlaws it, and this was -- the whole purpose of this was to bring the whole gun transactions into licensed dealers, into transactions between licensed dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.512" offset="5650808">Yet despite the importance of this basic prohibition in the gun control law, Congress exempted from that in their subparagraph (a), they state, "This paragraph in subsection (b) (3) shall not held -- be held to preclude a licensed dealer from returning a firearm to a person from whom it was received."</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.748" offset="5735758">In other words, despite the crucial importance of this Section, Congress exempted the type of repossession that we have in this case, that is the return of the gun to the person who deposited it with that licensed firearm dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.974" offset="5804617">Our second basic argument in the alternative is that the statutory language is so ambiguous that, and raises such serious constitutional questions that the statute should be narrowly construed in light of the statutory construction rules cited by this Court, the United States versus Bass, when dealing with another title of the same 1968 Gun Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.690" offset="6535523">This case essentially turns on the construction of a single relatively simple English word, acquisition, and its root, acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.348" offset="6570109">As has already been indicated, the essential dictionary definition of this word would be, to come into possession of, when which we perceive no basic ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.230" offset="6617652">We would also note that this word is used in correlation with the words sale or other disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.981" offset="6652656">When the man goes into the pawnshop, or into any transaction, he acquires the man in the other side of the counter, sells or disposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.345" offset="6690168">Now the word dispose and disposition itself appears throughout the statute as part of the basic scheme of control over the use of firearms, which is in fact the basic statutory purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.219" offset="7021610">I think that it doesn't have to be decided here, but I would point out as this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Marshall said in the Bass case that the purpose of the statute was to control the firearms related activities of felons and other dangerous persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.500" offset="7082736">And I trust that it will not be belaboring the obvious to indicate that this statute was passed, the debate was begun shortly after the assassination of Dr. King.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.286" offset="9305861">Government's -- the Government doesn't want and Congress didn't want that gun to get back into his hands and in addition, I would make this further point about 923 (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.102" offset="9349120">I believe the counsel opposite stated that, 'Well, this requirement was just a Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.260" offset="9369809">The Treasury could make those regulations."</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.197" offset="9377541">The statute, the 923 (g) says, that they may make regulations with regard to records of sales or other disposition, so that if we determine that this is not a disposition, they may be entitled to make no records at all when the gun goes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.016" offset="9448803">Now let me raise a point with regard to the gun going out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.570" offset="9459043">The counsel opposite spoke at several points about -- well, under California Law, only the owner -- only the pawnor could redeem the gun and he took that from California Financial Code 21201, which simply says that the borrower may redeem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.240" offset="9533753">Now the general law of pawn, taking either for example, the articles in CJS, or the specific laws in many states, is that anyone with the pawn ticket may get an item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.250" offset="9589760">The Uniform Commercial Code specifically says that such an interest is assignable, and as a matter of practice in California, pawnbrokers habitually return to the pawn ticket holder regardless of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.592" offset="9643154">So that if we cannot control the disposition of the gun, if we cannot control the gun as it goes out of the shop, we have the situation in which a felon, a new felon, a different felon, or a felon from a case where it was pawned by a non-felon, may then come in and get the gun without filling out any form at all, which again that's a large hole in the purpose of the statute being to control the disposition of firearms into the hands of people in these prohibited categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.316" offset="9789962">I believe we have indicated the statutory contexts, these words are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.827" offset="9812010">I would like to make an additional point with regard to the definition of pawnbrokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.144" offset="9837296">Under the old National Firearms Act, the wording was exactly as it is in the present one that dealers are persons engaged in the business of selling firearms at wholesale or retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.787" offset="9887869">Under that Act, pawnbrokers were licensed in the same way as any other person who was selling at wholesale or retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.770" offset="9919843">Now we had some discussion with regard to the question of the bowl of a watch swap, but it would certainly appear to me that in any indication of what was a sale, if one tried to escape by saying, "I sold the gun not for money, but for a bowl of a watch."</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.062" offset="9980970">He would certainly not be able to get out from under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.641" offset="9991314">So that the Congressional action in adding the wording that pawnbrokers defined as people who merely take pledges of guns are under the Act and in the report accompanying it specifically stating that pawnbrokers who deal in firearms, rather than those who sell them are under the Act, would certainly be a strong indication that something in addition to mere sales would have been included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.784" offset="10107925">We -- we've discussed the 922 (d), the question of other disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.179" offset="10129450">This is I believe a rather important policy implication that's concerned here, and that gets us to the question that I believe Mr. Justice Brennan raised with regard to the Laisure case that in Laisure, the Court specifically said, "Well, we believe that other disposition is broader than acquisition."</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.173" offset="10205414">And that this was where they found the ambiguity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.719" offset="10303634">If we follow the lead of the Laisure Court, and said that this is not an acquisition, but it is indeed a disposition, then it would appear that the arguments and the evils that the counsel opposite was attacking would be futile, because although he perhaps would be able to wiggle out under 922 (a) (6), he couldn't get the gun back under 922 (d) (1) because the dealer couldn't dispose of it to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2919.798" offset="11755938">May it please the Court Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.089" offset="11769104">First of all, I'd like to answer the argument of counsel that the pawnbrokers were included because of the worry of the swaps not being included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.114" offset="11813198">I don't think that was the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.454" offset="11818527">I think they were worried that their business which is primarily lending was not included, and that they were not in the business of selling guns at wholesale or retail, and particularly because of the unique nature of the foreclosure sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.458" offset="11870563">As to the question of their -- of the record keeping requirement for other dispositions and somehow knocking a hole in that, again the hole is not knocked in so far as there are any records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.546" offset="11926883">They don't -- the only hole that would be knocked is the question of whether Mr. Huddleston would be criminally liable for any statements made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.853" offset="11956140">And the Government has argued and has proceeded against people under Section 924 (a) with the same type of transaction that Mr. Huddleston engaged in, on a grounds that was a false statement on a record required to be kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.488" offset="12022700">Finally, I think that the point of the Gun Control Law was to focus on the dispositions by dealers, to regulate dealers, and in so far as people who were not supposed to have guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.218" offset="12077662">They were relying on the illegal possession statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.246" offset="12089783">And this case, because of the pawn records that are kept by virtue of state laws, by federal laws, by the truth and lending laws, Mr. Huddleston's transaction was an open, public transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.587" offset="12139102">His possession was a matter of record, and if the agent, who goes around to the pawnshops and checks the records, would've checked his police reports, he could've simply brought an illegal possession case against Mr. Huddleston.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.599" offset="12331154">They run it through Sacramento or the FBI, and they say, this fellow is a felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.994" offset="12348709">In this case, the felony was six years previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.175" offset="12361456">He had pleaded guilty to writing checks without sufficient funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.309" offset="12377966">The question is whether that is a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.050" offset="12384967">Technically, it is a felony under California Law even though he was sentenced to only 30 days in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.995" offset="12408686">But during the period that that was in pawn, he makes an open public statement, "So here I am and the government has the -- all the records."</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.086" offset="12449123">In fact, it would seem to me that under the Craven decision of the Sixth Circuit that they probably could prosecute him for illegal possession simply on the basis of the fact that he pawned the guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.993" offset="12488725">And he filled out his name and wrote, and said, "I accept the money for the gun that I am giving you."</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.899" offset="12508369">The gun is spelled out in the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.189" offset="12517460">So it seems to me that there is no legitimate enforcement device of the government that we are knocking out by asking for an honest, narrow construction of what we feel is an ambiguous statute that raises serious problems both in terms of fairness to people, in terms of property rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3154.666" offset="12695406">The question of the illegality of Mr. Huddleston's possession would require first proof that he was a convicted felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.667" offset="12727380">That would probably be proven by what was proven here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.075" offset="12741068">However, that under the United States versus Bass decision of this Court in 1971, an interstate commerce nexus would have to be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.873" offset="12772206">And -- honestly I think that is what is trying to be avoided by this procedure the government uses here, because they are trying to avoid the interstate commerce nexus that has to be shown under this Court's decision in Bass.</text>
