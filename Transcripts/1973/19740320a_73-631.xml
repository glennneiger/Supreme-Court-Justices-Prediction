            <text syncTime="13.934" offset="132493">To briefly put the matter back in focus, this is a Section 301 suit to compel arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.209" offset="185574">The problem it raises is whether the duty to arbitrate survives over a change in the identity of owners, where that change takes place against the background of a collective agreement enforced and is brought about by negotiations between the first employer and the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.871" offset="292258">At the afternoon recess yesterday, I was endeavoring to respond to Mr. Justice White’s questions concerning the scope of Wiley versus Livingston which was also a Section 301 case presenting the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.096" offset="373133">Naturally, Wiley like every other president leaves certain leeways in the law, but it is a recent decision and I hope we’ll be able to demonstrate that if rooted in basic precepts of the National Labor Policy, and is not simply a decision which can be read to settle the particular facts there before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.143" offset="485355">To understand its lessons, we believe it’s necessary to analyze its basic rationale.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.462" offset="554632">What is the scope of the arbitration agreement assuming arbitration is compelled?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="128.400" offset="590367">There are two aspects to that Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.995" offset="600712">First, we look at the scope of the arbitration agreement if one means what are the subsequent obligations which the second employer is bound by to be essentially equivalent to the process of arbitration mapped out in the Steelworkers’ trilogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.990" offset="708754">Namely that in the arbitration, the arbitrator is bound by the agreement, but he is to take into account changed circumstances and the different equities of the parties, and to fulfill his role as the expositor of the contractual law set out in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.552" offset="826932">Naturally, the assumption is that there will be more need for a creative and sensitive application of the agreement where there is a new employer, because he brings different insights, different presuppositions, and he may make certain changes within his permitted scope under the Managerial Prerogatives Clause which this agreement has, which may substantially change this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.073" offset="1025045">It is the framework, the duty to arbitrate survives and the arbitrator is to determine the subsequent obligations that survive.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.774" offset="1095889">Well, if the arbitrator isn’t bound by the contract, what framework does he use to determine what obligations survive?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="261.726" offset="1123683">The answer that I was attempting to give is that my understanding is that he is bound by the framework of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.953" offset="1148552">He cannot toss it over his shoulder and act as a someone who is making law, but he can take into account reasoned arguments from the second employer that changed circumstances, or different equities makes specific provisions inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.512" offset="1230785">It seems to us that that is the role that Wiley envisages and that’s what in essence the arbitrators have been doing in the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="306.755" offset="1303719">Yes, because if that were not true, then we would have to agree with the company that the task would not be a principled one, but we do think that the task is a principled one, and we do think that the flexibility is there in the sense that the arbitrator, just as he can under the Steelworkers trilogy, but to take into account changed situations and changed equities.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.837" offset="3712104">And the end is collective agreements which stabilize the terms and conditions of employment for certain period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.673" offset="3743451">And the practice of collective bargaining, as this Court has recognized in Warrior and Gulf, is to attempt to elect a system of self -- industrial self government which controls a specific business enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.912" offset="3808444">It sets the terms on which the employees deals with each other, and which they deal with the employer, and it binds employees who come into the unit after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.433" offset="3850449">It binds those who would not have supported the Union in the first place, and indeed to push for stability is so great, that if the employees change their mind during the term, they can’t get a Board election in which to express that, that’s the contract by rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.099" offset="3921189">And because of all that in one of the early leading cases this Court said, that the collective agreement is analogous to a tariff, or to a Government utility rates which bind all those who come within its terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.086" offset="4265064">It’s our theory that the cases stand together, after all in your opinion, you distinguished Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.526" offset="4298815">Our view is that there is a difference between the statutory obligations which can be drawn from Section 8 (a) (5) and the contractual obligations which can be implied as a matter of law just as the basic duty of arbitrators imply, and just as a no strike agreement can be implied, as this Court did in Lucas Flower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.845" offset="4392124">The very theory of contractual enforcement is that these duties can be implied by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.659" offset="4431412">And what Burns says is that the Board has a more limited authority, but that doesn’t seem to us to undercut the Board’s authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.438" offset="4466521">Indeed, in the AFL-CIO brief, the (Inaudible) brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.578" offset="4483030">We quoted from C&amp;C Plywood decision by Mr. Justice Stewart, in which he draws the point that when Congress made its decision to give the Courts the authority to enforce agreements, it rejected giving that authority to the Board, this is on page 6, because that would be Government compulsion of the terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.881" offset="4612284">But that authority given to the Courts isn’t the same, because the Courts are not deriving the obligations they state from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.554" offset="4658991">They are deriving them from the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.724" offset="4675605">The contract is interpreted in the normal way Courts interpret contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.812" offset="4695980">And I just want to conclude by saying that there are three basic choices open in Wiley, either the continuity with business enterprise the test drawn from the understanding of collective agreements would apply, or else the employer would be able to choose or not choose whether to be bound, and if he were able to choose or not choose whether to be bound, that would create an extraordinary disparity, because the employees would be at the second employer’s mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.631" offset="4811233">The value of their bargain would depend on whether or not he thought it was a good bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.562" offset="5667004">I think our first duty is to show that there is a continuity of the business enterprise which makes it proper to say the second employer is a successor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.977" offset="5780689">Yes, Your Honor, because we think that the background of the law is different that if that is the test, then the very issue to be are he can control whether or not there’s to be an arbitration by disregarding a potential obligation, and therefore, that the situation is different from the situation under 8 (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.251" offset="5865744">Under Section 8 (a) (5), first of all, there’s no obligation, and secondly you look to the employee complement because you’re asking whether or not there should be negotiations for new agreement whether there’s a duty to recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.382" offset="5918302">And the duty to recognize stands from the employee free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.392" offset="5934289">Employee free choice is subordinated to stability during the term of the agreement, and that’s why you don’t look to the employer-employee complement in a contract case, but rather as Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out, and certainly what he said is applicable in this case, you look to continuity on the employer side, continuity in the business enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.747" offset="6023732">And if that is there, then the duty to arbitrate does follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.240" offset="6397701">Your Honor, it so happens that I was the attorney for an employer in a case which was a companion to the Burns case at the Board, and my client desired that the contract continue in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.657" offset="6447334">The Union did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.983" offset="6456633">The company had been bought by a larger company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.205" offset="6469590">The Union saw an opportunity to negotiate a better contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.143" offset="6489339">The Board, as you know in Burns, said the contract did continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.085" offset="6513058">The case in which I was involved was never appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.630" offset="6523298">I submit that it had been appealed with Burns, The result would’ve been the same as Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.018" offset="6548793">The continuation of the contract is a two-party affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.976" offset="6568647">The contract does not run with the business, as Mr. Justice Marshall says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.083" offset="6593097">It is something which is a matter of consent, and both the company and the Union must consent for the contract to continue in effect, and this Court pointed out in Burns the policy considerations which require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.561" offset="6666971">Court pointed out that there could be considerations on both sides of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.262" offset="6685780">Now, the duty -- the contractual, consensual duty to be bound by that contract and to arbitrate in accordance with the contract is inevitably intertwined with the status of successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.100" offset="6769162">And the questions which the Court has put to Mr. Gold demonstrate the difference this case and Wiley, and indeed the difference between this case and the case like Lion Dry Goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.584" offset="6819109">In Wiley, the plaintiffs who brought grievances had attained employment status with the employer, and thereafter, had grievances arise, differences with their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.084" offset="6881071">And this Court in Wiley held that those grievances which arose after the employment’s relationship existed rose subject arbitration under their contract of the prior employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.086" offset="6933107">There is certainly a serious question whether even that can stand today in view of the Court’s unanimous ruling that the contract does not survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.547" offset="6970932">The question becomes, what is parameters for the arbitrator?</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.206" offset="6993607">What is the basis in which he can make a decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.737" offset="7007713">But, in any event the contract cannot be a vehicle with which the persons who claim grievances under this contract can attain employment status with the new employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.034" offset="8308924">I agree with you, Your Honor, and I believe that is the real meaning of the Wiley decision, and that’s the full meaning of the Wiley decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.728" offset="8343615">You cannot boot scrap the successorship doctrine without retention of employees, or hiring of employees by the new employer into a requirement that he must take the employees, and therefore must recognize the Union, unless you are really going to say as Mr. Justice White said that you’re going to take a very large bite out of Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.205" offset="8449567">There is in Burns a decision which was unanimous as to the effect of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.730" offset="8479660">And that decision is not consistent with the position of respondent in this case, or the position of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.804" offset="8511948">It is consistent with the petitioner’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.567" offset="8526994">We request therefore, that the Court reverse the decision below.</text>
