            <text syncTime="38.297" offset="229982">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.680" offset="243461">The issue before this Court today in this case is whether US Magistrates are empowered by the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968 to conduct the evidentiary hearings in habeas corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.959" offset="292571">I would like to first briefly tell how the case got to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.528" offset="318903">In 1971, the Respondent, Carl James Wedding, after exhausting all his available state postconviction remedies, filed a petition in US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, claiming that his 1949 conviction for willful murder was invalid based on contention of court’s plea of guilty, in effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.779" offset="423915">The District Court reviewed his petition and summarily dismissed as being without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.002" offset="448784">A certificate of probable cause was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.440" offset="458501">The respondent, Mr. Wedding, then appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.455" offset="482534">The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded the District Court’s decision saying that the petition presented certain factual questions which require an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.016" offset="528823">On remand, the matter was assigned to the US Magistrate to conduct the evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.128" offset="565290">The evidentiary hearing was conducted by the Magistrate and recorded by electronic sound recorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.208" offset="593607">The Magistrate, in conducting the hearing concerning all the pleadings and all available state records, made a finding of fact, proposed findings of fact and conclusion of law, report and recommendation that the petition of Mr. Wedding be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.411" offset="666436">The District Court upon request by counsel for Respondent, Mr. Wedding, gave the double considerations of recorded testimony, electronically recorded testimony of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.779" offset="715860">Thereafter, the District Judge after reviewing all of the pleadings, they recorded all the considerations of recording of the evidentiary hearing, adopted the Magistrate’s findings of facts, conclusions of law, report and recommendation as his own and dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.572" offset="795063">Whereupon, the respondent once again appealed to the Sixth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit reversed again, stating that US Magistrates are not empowered by the Federal Magistrates Act to conduct the evidentiary hearings in habeas corpus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.506" offset="870818">We submit that the Magistrates are empowered by the Section 636 (b) of the Federal Magistrates Act to conduct the evidentiary hearing of posttrial cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.501" offset="914704">636 (b) in substance states that by concurrence of the majority of the judges of the District Court, they can adopt assigned additional duties to the US Magistrates, so long as they are not inconsistent with the constitutional laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.903" offset="1000385">Inherent in this language are two limitations on the duties assignable to the Magistrate: First, the Magistrate may act only pursuant to a rule passed by a majority of the judges of the District Court, as was done in this case; and two, the duties so assignable must be consistent with the constitution and laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.678" offset="1739442">The intent and purpose of the Habeas Corpus Act was to determine the legality of the intention of the person held and restraint of his liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.270" offset="1769848">Now the intent of the Magistrate Act in respect to the habeas corpus petitions, it was clearly that the intention of Congress to have Magistrates assists the overburdened -- the courts which are overburdened by habeas corpus applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.338" offset="1898057">In order that this new tier of judicial office which was created by the Magistrate Act of 1968, in order that they might be able to perform this function, Congress upgraded the old Commissioner System not only in position but in the qualifications so that Magistrates would be qualified to adequately perform this must needed assistance to the judges of their crowded dockets of habeas corpus petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.845" offset="1996173">For this reason, we submit that the Magistrates Act is consistent with the Habeas Corpus Act and actually forces or supports its purpose and intent, and that it ensures that the person was illegally -- who is detained is getting upon determination as to the legality of his restraint of his liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.901" offset="2276310">The Congress intended to make this 636 (b) purposely broad and flexible in order that the judges might be able to utilize the Magistrates to the efficiency of the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.235" offset="6501669">Mr. Justice Blackmun, there are some provisions in that statute which I think are important for this Court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.700" offset="6539598">Number one, the Magistrate in those federal crimes statute has jurisdiction over those crimes, which are normally denominated as misdemeanors up to a year, carrying up to a year in the penitentiary up to $1,000 fine or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.997" offset="6608771">However, there is also the provision that the defendant and the Government have to agree to the trial before the Magistrate, and there is also of course the right of appeal to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.137" offset="6657254">But I think that’s a very important distinction because not only does it take the agreement of the parties but the Magistrate only has that limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.622" offset="6707200">Whereas, if this Court were to hold that the Magistrate have the authority to hold evidentiary hearings, he would be weighing the liberty of persons filing habeas corpus who are incarcerated for a much more lengthy period of time as, for example, the respondent in this case who is under a life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.482" offset="9174727">Is one of your concerns, Mr. Glass what I would consider as perfectly legitimate feeling that although the rule perhaps contemplates the District Judge sit there and listen to the tapes if he is busy and doesn’t want to just duplicate the time that the Magistrate put in, he may short circuit that process a little bit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.495" offset="9250691">That, I think it’s a legitimate concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.079" offset="9265110">It’s not a particular concern of me in that -- let me just say that I have a degree of faith in the three district judges that we have in the Western District of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.480" offset="9330625">However, I do think that to allow the Magistrate to hold an evidentiary hearing and still say that it’s within the providence of the Article III Judge to hold another evidentiary hearing is just one more step in the judicial process and I don’t think that’s what the Act was intended for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.067" offset="9417038">It’s just like another appeal and then if the District Judge rules that the Magistrate’s finding of fact and conclusions of the law are correct then you go up to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in our situation and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.735" offset="9479732">And I don’t think that’s what the Act calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.169" offset="9489450">The Act, I believe, was intended simply to reduce the routine of mundane workload of the District Judge so that he could address himself to things like evidentiary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.319" offset="9529992">And Sixth Circuit noted in their opinion in this case that they couldn’t see how an evidentiary hearing that is listening to the tape de novo would require anymore time than an actual evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.808" offset="9591954">And along the lines of the suggestions that I have made that the Magistrate can do, I think that he could reduce the time necessary for an evidentiary hearing and could probably almost pinpoint it by taking this proceedings through with counsel in the form of plea hearing conferences with the counsel, because the counsel are appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.021" offset="9700833">And then submit a report to the judge that the hearing is going to take 45 minutes or it’s going to take an-hour-and-a-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.025" offset="9724865">It’s going to take three hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.767" offset="9731866">These are the witnesses that are probably to be called.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.621" offset="10039275">If you go back to the appellate process and if the petitioner and/or his counsel knew at the time they had the pre-hearing conference with the Magistrate that certain matters were available, that certain people were available, if they wanted to get a certain issue into evidence if they knew at that time and didn’t disclose it, then I think they would not be entitled to bring it up by a way of notice or within the hearing itself under those circumstances.</text>
