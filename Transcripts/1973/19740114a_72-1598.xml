            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1598, National Labor Relations Board against Bell Aerospace.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.463" offset="230609">Mr. Come, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="45.067" offset="257045">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.011" offset="276793">This case is here on certiorari to the Second Circuit and the principal question involves the extent to which certain kinds of employees whom the Board calls managerial employees are covered by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.089" offset="357146">Now managerial employees, is a Board concept, it’s not a statutory definition and the Board has defined these employees -- as employees who are in a position to formulate, determine and effectuate management policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.450" offset="442514">The category as I will show is not limited to top management, nor is it limited to persons who carry out labor relations policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.497" offset="490684">But it includes a wide range of minor administrative or executive personnel such as buyers, expediters, claims adjusters, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.641" offset="539272">The present case involves buyers employed by a company which manufactures and sells rocket engines and electronic equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.050" offset="592980">Now it is the Board’s position that managerial employees, assuming that they are not otherwise exempt as supervisors are covered by the National Labor Relations Act and thus entitled to organizational and bargaining rights under the Act unless their duties are concerned with labor relations or other matters which are likely to cause a conflict between their job responsibilities and their responsibilities to a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.237" offset="713665">The court below on the other hand held that all managerial employees are exempt from the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.013" offset="740833">What -- Mr. Come, what’s the Board’s theory on the -- you say this is not a statutory concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.888" offset="768313">It’s a pure Board case by case definition?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="177.604" offset="787122">And pursuant to what authority did it report to include -- to say exclude the recovery to managerial employees of any kind other than supervisors?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="189.021" stopTime="277.195">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="189.021" offset="832784">I will show that that is based upon some indication in the legislative history which I’ll get to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.414" offset="898403">The case arises in this factual setting, Local 1286 of the Auto Workers filed a petition with the Board seeking certification as the bargaining representative of 25 buyers employed in the Purchasing and Procurement Department of the Company’s Wheatfield, New York Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.692" offset="991504">The company opposed the petition on the ground that the buyers were managerial employees and thus excluded from the Acts coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.587" offset="1027135">At a hearing before the Board, the following facts were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.539" offset="1046883">The purchasing and procurement department fills orders from 30 other departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.551" offset="1070916">This involves purchasing, maintenance and repair items such as fuel oil and light bulbs, support items such as packaging and paper and production items ranging from simple nuts and bolts to sophisticated components for the equipment of the company manufacturers and about 70% of the company’s business consists of parts for the Minute Man missile project.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="277.195" offset="1185541">The nuts and bolts don’t loom very large in that total spectrum, do they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="281.614" stopTime="635.318">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="281.614" offset="1203200">I said that 70% of the company’s business are materials for the Minute Man missile project, some of which has nuts and bolts.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.185" offset="1261505">Many of the purchases are off the shelf items which can be obtained from a number of sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.310" offset="1285956">Other items must be made up according to the companies’ specific needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.473" offset="1306645">The buyers in this proceeding work under a procurement director -- an assistant procurement director, two purchasing agents and four supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.782" offset="1359830">There are seven or Eighth supervisory personnel over the buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.170" offset="1385430">The buyers need not have a college education nor does the company have any formal training program for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.341" offset="1414060">They are guided in their work by a procurement manual and other written instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.646" offset="1439347">Their salaries range from a $195.00 to $275.00 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.606" offset="1471216">They are not paid for casual over time but they are compensated for scheduled over time that has been authorized by a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.469" offset="1506638">Purchase orders are initiated by requisition from the various departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.147" offset="1529313">These codes of procurement department whether they are assigned to a supervisor who in turn assigns them to a particular buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.967" offset="1568601">Requisitions for items which have been ordered previously generally specify a particular vendor.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.139" offset="1601306">Where no vendor has been designated under requisition, the buyer is free to select one.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.894" offset="1628369">When obtaining sophisticated production items, purchasing decision are made by a team of supervisory personnel from the engineering quality assurance finance and manufacturing departments and the buyer “X” is the team chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.128" offset="1697228">The buyers may place or cancel orders of less than $5,000.00 on their own signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.729" offset="1723664">Larger orders however require supervisory approval with higher levels of supervision required as the cost rises.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.511" offset="1774759">Indeed an order is over $5,000.00 the buyer is required to conduct pre negotiations with supervisory personnel and the procurement department before he can even contact a potential vendor.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.102" offset="1845185">On the basis of these facts and others in the record, the Board assumed that the buyers were managerial employees as the company contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.148" offset="1893355">However following its decision in North Arkansas Electric where it held that managerial employees were covered by the act and entitled to representation or rights there under unless they or concerned with labor relations or other matters it would present the conflict of interest that I alluded to earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.559" offset="1983007">The Board concluded that the company’s buyers were not in this category and therefore covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.687" offset="2015504">The Board rejected the company’s claim that the buyer’s authority to commit the company’s credit and to select suppliers created a potential conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.303" offset="2065972">In that the buyers would be more receptive to higher bids from unionized contractors, the Board found that the purchasing discretion of the buyer was neither quoting from the Board presently so on bridled or potentially so uncontrollable as to create the possible problems of which the employer complains.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.783" offset="2155833">And the Board then found that a unit of buyers alone would constitute an appropriate unit for collective bargaining directed in election in the unit which the union want -- certify the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.756" offset="2207765">The company refused to bargain in order to test the certification the Board issued a bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.597" offset="2239112">The Court of Appeals, as I indicated rejected the Board’s view that managerial employees are covered by the Act except where a conflict of interest is presented and hailed that a managerial employee is not only an employee that would present a conflict of interest problem but any one who has formulating, determining or effectuating his employer’s policies or as discretion independent of an employer’s established policy in the performance of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.600" offset="2395115">If you fell into that category you are a managerial employee and not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.569" offset="2423014">However, the court added that the Board would not be precluded from determining that the buyer is here or some types of them might not be managerial employees as it define the term in a remand of the case to the Board for such a determination but directed the Board to do so via a role making proceeding under Section Four of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.844" offset="2548088">Now we do not think that we reach that issue although we are prepared to if the Board’s definition of managerial employee is upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.606" offset="2895203">We would have to also disagree with the Second -- we’d have to disagree with the Second Circuit to as to the reading as to what you have done.</text>

          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="710.398" stopTime="907.104">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="710.398" offset="2918296">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.629" offset="2923311">Now I like to get to what we have been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.701" offset="2939507">Section 23 of the Wagner Act provided that the term employee shall include any employee but shall not include any individual employed as an agricultural laborer or into domestic service of any family or person at his home or any individual employed by his parent or his spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.886" offset="3028323">Now the Board early ruled that since the statutory definition was of wide comprehension and only had these three exclusions in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.878" offset="3064268">It covered all other employees including managerial employees and supervisory employees, thus the discharge of managerial or supervisory employees were engaging in union activity would violate Section 81 and 3 of the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.187" offset="3133544">The Board however excluded managerial and supervisory employees from bargaining units of rank and file employees on the ground that their duties are closely related to management.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.832" offset="3196029">With respect to supervisors because that’s where most of the action occurred under the Wagner Act, the Board vacillated between holding that not only were supervisors not included but then rank and file units but for a time it held that it wasn’t even appropriate to put them in a unit confined as supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.193" offset="3297489">But the Board changed that policy in the Packard case and found that a unit of supervisors was appropriate for bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.199" offset="3345554">The Packard case came to this Court in 1947 and this Court by a five to four vote sustained the Board’s position that foreman were protected by the Act and that a unit limited to foreman or supervisors was appropriate for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.085" offset="3425071">Now in 1947, Congress turned around and overturned the Packard decision by specifically excluding any individual employed as a supervisor from the Section 23 definition of employee and thus from the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.521" offset="3506782">The legislative evolution of this exclusion however is very significant, the House Bill defined a supervisor as including not only those individuals with power to higher transfer, promote and discharge or discipline other employees but also personnel who fix or make effective recommendation with respect to wages earned by other employees, labor relations, timestudy, police and guard personnel and confidential employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.040" offset="3652859">This would have excluded from coverage not only the traditional supervisors but many of the individuals whom the Board had treated as managerial employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.241" offset="3773753">Except in so far as they would have been excludable as supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.181" offset="3789427">It is difficult to conceive of one in that position that would not have met the supervisory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.183" offset="3829447">Now that Senate Bill defined the term supervisor more narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.335" offset="3854106">Limiting it to individuals having authority to higher transfer, suspend layoff and so on the traditional indicia of a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.631" offset="3907291">The Senate report and the Senate debates showed that the narrower Senate definition represented a rejection of the views of those who instead of merely wanting to over turn Packard and excludes supervisors with genuine management prerogatives from the Act wanted to exclude wider categories of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.589" offset="4003109">At a conference committee accepted the Senate’s definition of supervisor and with regard to those additional employees would been included within the House but not the Senate definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.536" offset="4062877">The conference reports stated, in the case of persons working in the labor relations, personnel and employment departments, it was not thought necessary to make specific provision as was done in the House Bill since the Board has treated and will continue to treat such persons as outside the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.451" offset="4166531">This is the prevailing Board practice with respect to such people as confidential secretaries as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.351" offset="4198191">They went on to say that they were not excluding timestudy people or guards nor did they exclude professional employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.425" offset="4254407">Now the House Conference Report, in so far as it stated that the Board was excluding persons working in the labor relations personnel and employment departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.746" offset="4351687">From the coverage of the Act, it was mistaken and that the only thing that the Board had done with respect to those people as it had done with respect to supervisors was to hold that they were not appropriately included in units of rank and file or office or in clerical employees but giving that conference report, the benefit of what of the misapprehension that the conferees were under.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.073" offset="4561084">The most that it shows was an intent to exclude from the coverage of the Act labor relations personnel and employees in the employment departments and confidential employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.695" offset="4643527">The buyers here and most other of the managerial employees not concerned with labor relations policy certainly do not fit within that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.531" offset="4702877">Now the reason for excluding persons in the labor relations and employment departments from coverage is that people with those duties are in a position where their duties could bring them into a conflict of interest situation if you were to accord them unionization rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.649" offset="4847386">The Board’s test of what managerial employees are and are not covered by the Act we submit gives effect to this congressional intention that those types of employees should be excluded from coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.774" offset="4947801">Whereas on the other hand, the broader definition of the Court of Appeals that what exclude from coverage not only managerial employees who are concerned with labor relations policies but any other employee who is concerned with effectuating the employers policies would exclude from coverage thousands of employees who there is no reason to believe that Congress would have wanted to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.926" offset="5116447">It would exclude many employees that certainly do not rise to the level of the frontline of management which was what Congress was careful to confine itself to in restricting the definition of supervisor and it would exclude many who certainly are not as well trained as professional employees whom Congress did not exclude from the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.328" offset="5250090">The only provision that was made with respect to professional employees was to say that before you can group them with in a unit with non professionals, you have to give them a self determination election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.107" offset="5301185">Now what are the reasons which lead the Court of Appeals to what we regard as a misreading of the congressional intention?</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.391" offset="5358341">The Court of Appeals thought that unless they adopted the expansive interpretation of managerial employees and I have just alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.582" offset="5439112">You would not be giving full effect to this Court’s decision in the -- that is the dissent in this core -- in the Packard case which to be sure was very, very responsible for the exclusion of supervisors from the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.752" offset="5531794">Now in Packard however, the dissent as we read it was concerned with putting in the employer category all those who acted for management, not only in formulating but in also executing its labor policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.842" offset="5644121">The Boards’ conflict of interest test excludes from the coverage of the Act managerial employees who are so involved with labor policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.457" offset="5690619">Now the court below also said, and this gets back I believe that the question that you have asked Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that if you would interpret, unless you interpret managerial employees as broadly as the court below did, it could lead to the organization of vice presidents and other top executives which was prophesied in the dissenting opinion in Packard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.078" offset="5833038">We submit that the Board’s test does not do that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.038" offset="5852891">In the first place as I mentioned before, most such executives are likely to be excluded from the Act as supervisors and those who do not meet the supervisory definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.067" offset="6961006">Now, the Court of Appeals felt that the Board had in the Swift case, lead Congress when it amended the Act in 1959 to believe that buyers were not covered by the Act and therefore the fact that Congress in 1959 did not change the Act, should be deemed to fortify the view that buyers were not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.239" offset="7157656">Now, in the Swift case in 1954 to be sure, the Board held a separate unit of poultry procurement drivers could not constitute an appropriate unit for collective bargaining because it was the clearer intent of Congress to explode from the coverage of the act, all individuals allied with management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.556" offset="7270922">We submit that this was an inaccurate statement that went beyond Congress’ intent in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.508" offset="7318779">It was contrary to numerous Board decisions immediately after the enactment of the 1947 amendments which merely held that managerial employees could not be included in the same bargaining unit with rank and file employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.137" offset="7401326">The fact that Congress in 1959 did nothing, we further submit is of no relevance because when it amended the Act in 1959, there is nothing in those amendments which dealt in so far as the basic 1959 changes dealt with the rights of labor unions under Landrum-Griffin recording and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.113" offset="7541238">And the only amendments to the National Labor Relations Act were to strengthen the union unfair laborer practices against secondary boycotts and picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2219.991" offset="8956761">My partner, now deceased, Mr. Winch handled the original proceedings before the epic time of the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.286" offset="9045891">The buyers in this case who petitioned to be represented under the Labor Management Relation Act were 25 in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.299" offset="9077969">The job description called for preferred or senior buyer and that was the largest number of them of a college education with a business administration specially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.149" offset="9121332">Now it’s true that many of them did not have them and that was not covered at the hearing but six years, practical experience was considered a substitute for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.614" offset="9159158">In this case, the buyers and may I just say that our business was not either burning fuel oil or burning out electric light bulbs as the brief might suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.577" offset="9203043">We are contractor, very heavily in research and development and 70% of our business is the guidance package, propulsion package for the Minute Man missile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.855" offset="9252153">A large part of which is Tailor Made, the most exact specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.629" offset="9271275">The buyers in this case had the prime responsibility, two-fold of seeing a steady flow of a necessary material, special tools and components came to the plant at belt so that the production schedule for our Missile Man would stay on line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.582" offset="9339089">Second, they had the responsibility to see that this was done with the maximum economy of the company, their employer’s money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.629" offset="9375242">One buyer, senior buyer in this case in the 19th-month period which we are talking about, spent $1,300,000.00 as on an issue taking collectively the amount that he purchased on his own say so alone, the group in total.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.294" offset="12685897">Now this is where Judge Friendly said, “If you are going to change and say, what is always been a part of management and say that’s not management or say if you will, that management has the right to organize and bargain under the Act with management if you cannot show that it is labor sensitive or in a conflict of interest.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.720" offset="12871680">It was never intended that management would bargain with non-labor sensitive management and that was the position that Mr. Judge Friendly took and he said, “If you want to establish a rule now that managerial employees, part of management have the right to organize and bargain with other management if they are outside the labor relations department or if they are not in a conflict of interest situation, you go back to Congress with that argument.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.823" offset="12988082">But he said, “If what you are trying to say is that buyers whom for this whole period from 1947 to 1970, on similar facts situations, without exceptions during that period, the Board had treated as they did on Swift and American Locomotive and treated those type of employees as a part of management and said that they were outside that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.597" offset="13431118">Congress quickly corrected that and said they should not be -- they should be excluded from the Act and that was done but from the very beginning of the National Labor Relations Act had certainly throughout its whole history hold purposes to provide a system of ground rules between management on one side and labor on the other and no attempt, I don’t believe Mr. Justice White was ever made to say the following shall constitute management and the following shall constitute labor.</text>
