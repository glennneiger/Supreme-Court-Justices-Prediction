            <text syncTime="21.022" offset="160810">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.540" offset="174916">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia, Circuit Court of Appeals on a petition of the Renegotiation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.436" offset="214518">It is a suit under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.416" offset="230400">That Act provides that any member of the public is entitled to non-exempt federal agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.326" offset="270002">If the party requesting records does not receive them from the agency voluntarily, he is entitled to sue in the District Court to compel the production of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.573" offset="343040">The plaintiffs are government contractors who are negotiating to determine whether they must refund excess profits to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.083" offset="393091">They have sued to compel the Board to produce documents relating to their renegotiation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.314" offset="434051">The District Court in this Freedom of Information Act suits issued temporary injunctions against the continued conduct of the negotiation procedures pending the resolution of the Court of Claim -- the Freedom of Information Act claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.489" offset="534674">The Court of Appeals affirmed those rulings, the government is here appealing on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.613" offset="567171">The merits of the party’s Freedom of Information Act claims are not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.913" offset="608444">In order to evaluate the issues in this case, it is important to understand the nature of the Renegotiation Act proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.441" offset="658495">The Renegotiation Act requires the Board to try to reach an agreement with government contractors concerning the amount of excess profits they have earned which they should refund to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.170" offset="749401">The Board is involved in negotiations essentially in offers of settlement rather than in adjudications on the merits of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.385" offset="810318">They attempt to reach settlement by a series of essentially five different negotiating levels within the Board, there’s Regional Board and National Board, and you negotiate through five levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.459" offset="886596">The contractor submits statements giving financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.307" offset="917943">The Board then considers the statements, meets with the contractor, and makes an offer in settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.136" offset="965277">The contractor is then entitled to a statement giving the basis for that settlement offer in order for him to determine whether he was just to accept it or to require the Board to negotiate again at a higher level.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.054" offset="1040927">And of course, at each level, the Board may increase or decrease the amount of the offer in settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.818" offset="1076036">If the contractor accepts the first level offer, Mrs. Shapiro, is that then binding on the government?</text>

            <text syncTime="260.035" offset="1116891">If no settlement is reached within the Board, the Board issues an assessment, a determination of the amount of the contractor’s liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.491" offset="1182720">Then the contractor is entitled to a trial on the merits in the Court of Claims, that trial is de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.389" offset="1226292">The government must prove the amount of the contractor’s liability and the proceedings in the Board are simply not relevant to the Court of Claims determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.271" offset="1297868">Of course, the contractor when he gets to the Court of Claims is entitled to use the Court of Claims’ discovery procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.245" offset="2065763">This Court held in Aircraft and Diesel Equipment Corporation against Hirsch that these proceedings were not to be enjoined even when as in that case, the contractor alleged that he had been unable to participate effectively in the proceedings because he did not have information upon which the Board had relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.253" offset="2189793">The Court, nevertheless, found that Congress had intended the entire negotiation ending with the adjudication was supposed to be completed without judicial interference.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.716" offset="2267638">I noticed in your footnote 6, page 5 of the Board’s brief this gets back to my brother Blackmun’s question that Astro asked copies of the recommendations contained in the renegotiation report prepared by the staff.</text>

            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="620.273" offset="2557806">Well, certainly you would have trouble on the breadth of that in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.349" offset="2582152">You would also have a great trouble on the breadth of that on the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.126" offset="2629277">The effect of the decision below is to alter the ruling of this Court in the Aircraft and Diesel Equipment Corporation against Hirsch at least to the extent of permitting temporary injunctions against Board procedures while Freedom of Information Act questions are litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.228" offset="2717675">Our contention is that this is a misinterpretation of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.805" offset="2744007">The Freedom of Information Act was not designed to permit courts to review agency rulings on the scope of discovery in pending proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.365" offset="2798237">The Freedom of Information Act was specifically intended to change the rule that had existed before that those properly and directly concerned had a greater right to agency records than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.650" offset="2875350">Instead, the Freedom of Information Act indicated that all members of the public have an equal right to the use of agency records regardless of the use that they intend to make of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.757" offset="2939820">The contractors here claim that the special use they wish to make of these records entitles them to a special remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.634" offset="2975242">But what the Act says is that all members of the public have an equal right to a prompt resolution of their claims of entitlement to documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.208" offset="3025607">The Congress provided a very specific remedy to protect the specific right, which they established.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.622" offset="3063223">And in that remedy, they emphasized the importance of speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.821" offset="3087987">They provided that the suits to compel the production of documents should be given priority on the District Court’s docket and expedited in every way.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.073" offset="3161025">If the remedy, which the Court below found is permitted, it will tip the balance that Congress established instead of making the Freedom of Information Act claims promptly determined, instead, it will become a very effective tool for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.720" offset="3275651">For once people in the position of the contractors here have obtained a stay of the proceeding, which threatens them, they have no interest in the prompt resolution of their claims under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.735" offset="3339703">Instead, their interest is entirely in delaying the resolution of these claims and therefore delaying the continuation of the administrative procedure which can affect them adversely.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.144" offset="3401352">Even if the state rarely granted the existence of the jurisdiction to grant the remedy will encourage litigation, this is a possible means of obtaining a delay of the agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.497" offset="3482749">We therefore contend that the issuance of injunctions against the continuation of agency proceedings is not consistent with the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.093" offset="3537084">And that the courts below expanded on the Act and acted legislatively rather than judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.979" offset="3568640">Certainly, Congress could have concluded the specific uses to be made of the information just to find specific protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.874" offset="3616287">They could have concluded that the interests of those involved in agency proceedings were so important that it was appropriate to require the courts to review agency rulings on the scope of discovery and pending procedures proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.588" offset="3691102">We contend that the Act simply does not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.004" offset="3708761">If it had intended to change the traditional allocation of responsibilities between agencies and courts, they would have said so clearly and there is no indication of any such intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.209" offset="3785561">We do not believe that the issuance of the injunction in these cases was consistent with the traditional equitable power to maintain the status quo because in this case, it was not a situation in which a court has acted to stay agency action while it determines the validity of that agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.713" offset="3903634">Instead, what they did was to stay the agency proceedings while they reviewed the validity of collateral agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.398" offset="3958387">In effect, they have stayed the Renegotiation Board proceedings while they reviewed the Board’s determination of the proper scope of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.275" offset="4005825">And this is certainly not a traditional exercise of equitable power.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.165" offset="4037381">In some, as this Court recognized last term in Environmental Protection Agency against Mink.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.687" offset="4071445">The Freedom of Information Act provides a workable formula which carefully protects and balances all interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.314" offset="4110002">The Act protects the public interest and prompt access to government records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.156" offset="4145424">It also protects the public interest in minimal of interference with efficient government operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.738" offset="4195683">The specific remedy that they provided is an important part of this balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.313" offset="4225985">The additional remedy that the Court below granted upsets this careful balance and it does not, if not, in order to achieve the purposes of the statute which is a prompt availability of government records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.830" offset="4292023">But instead, to give the contractors the specific benefit in their negotiations with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.637" offset="4331311">This is simply not consistent with the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.319" offset="4362031">The Court below, nevertheless, found that the District Court had properly exercised not only that it had jurisdiction to enjoin agency proceedings under the Freedom of Information Act but that it had properly exercised this jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.606" offset="4455131">Since unless the proceedings -- renegotiation proceedings were enjoined, the contractors would be irreparably injured if they were compelled to negotiate without the information they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.140" offset="4513332">And since there was no review as such of the proceedings in the Court of Claims, we believe this is incorrect in both of the Aircraft case and in Lichter against United States, this Court recognized that the renegotiation procedures were designed to be very informal and that they were not to be adjudications with the discovery, formal discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.092" offset="4665156">They are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.548" offset="4678949">They are designed to help the defense and effort by obtaining rampant settlement in procurement matters and they are not designed to help the contractors get a more favorable settlement than they might be entitled to by an adjudication on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.945" offset="4764526">So the contractors are not entitled to the most favorable settlement that they could reach if they were negotiating with full information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.370" offset="4818233">What they are entitled to is a full and fair hearing in the Court of Claims on the merits of their liability and that is what is provided in the Renegotiation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.990" offset="4884689">Furthermore, the fact that the review in the Court of Claims is de novo does not mean that there is any irreparable injury if they don’t get the information before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.717" offset="4943621">If they are not satisfied that the Board determination is fair, they may get a determination in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.294" offset="4973923">And at that point, the prior Board procedures are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.075" offset="4997016">In one sense, they are in a better position than they would be if there was a review proceeding in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.587" offset="5039125">Since the Court of Claims does not need to consider whether there’s substantial evidence to support the Board procedures and they may not show that they received any prejudice from Board procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.814" offset="5107984">In short, the Board procedures can impose no continuing disadvantage on the contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.914" offset="5140376">And therefore the enjoining of those procedures was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.594" offset="5167125">I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.669" offset="5235461">First, the regulations of the Board as they were amended last November -- November 197, in fact provide that from now on, a contractor on request will get all of the information, I believe that Bannercraft asked for and most of the information that the other contractors asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.449" offset="5318531">For example in 32 CFR Section 1472.7, the regulations of the Board now provide that a contractor may have on request the performance information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.099" offset="5365133">That is the performance evaluation of other agencies of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.551" offset="5378926">Or in the case of a subcontractor-prime contractor relationship, the performance information provided by prime contractor on the level of performance of the subcontractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.839" offset="6700095">Well, precisely, if the Court please, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.077" offset="6709081">It’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.281" offset="6713887">There’s plenty of relief in the Freedom of Information Act, however, there’s nothing in the Freedom of Information Act that says that the Court does not have a general equity of power to consider whether the renegotiations that stayed for a short period of time, the renegotiation process, but it seems clear on the face of it and I submit on the face of the regulations now that it’s abundantly clear that they are ignoring the responsibility under the other Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.693" offset="6807510">This is just a traditional exercise of the equity power where -- I think we established the irreparable injury can accrue by virtue of the Boards’ refusal to follow the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.331" offset="6858083">The Board has been told in numerous cases that they must follow the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.928" offset="6872503">There are several Federal Court decisions and Appellate Court decisions instructing the Board to follow the statute and now they have done so in their regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.995" offset="6912731">We do not suggest that there’s any authority in the Freedom of Information Act to grant this type of an injunction but we say that when a failure of an agency to follow its own regulation or follow a statute is brought to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.291" offset="6965917">The Court does have general equity power which can be exercised only in very limited circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.124" offset="6989218">I wish to point out that as this Court has held, and as the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia has held repeatedly where there is judicial review of the agency process, the Court should not entertain interlocutory appeals except in very rare special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.405" offset="7054420">We have no problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.429" offset="7062465">The NLRB cases, the other agency cases where there’s statutory review, there you get review in the Court of Appeals of a denial of due process or denial of procedural or substantive errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.474" offset="7110635">We don’t get that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.492" offset="7118681">A counsel said in response to you in response to you Mr. Justice Rehnquist that if we agree with the first level of renegotiation, is the government bound?</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.739" offset="7147729">They are not bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.192" offset="7153476">The Statutory Board, can at any time, and they have done this to me on more than one occasion, set aside an agreement with the Regional Board reached after a conference with the renegotiator and assign the case to itself and go through the entire process all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.354" offset="7218155">And understanding -- we get no understanding of what the Board is doing until after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.677" offset="7235500">Let me try to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.261" offset="7245740">We have a meeting with the Regional Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.558" offset="7254936">The Regional Board writes us a letter and it’s shown in the exhibits to our complaint to ask Bannercraft $1,400,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.772" offset="7291820">We then asked summary of facts and reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.056" offset="7301016">It was after the fact that they gave us their reasons and we could take it or leave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.836" offset="7324108">It is after they have made their judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.421" offset="7334452">Then we go to the Statutory Board and the same procedure obtains.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.603" offset="7447197">They can reassign the case to itself at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.009" offset="7468826">After the Statutory Board makes its determination then you get, it's on request, a statement of the reasons for the Statutory Board action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.047" offset="7500904">But there’s no further negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.861" offset="7508219">You would have paid it or you don’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.413" offset="7518354">Now, as a result of the summary where the Regional Board told us that we have been compared with other contractors as they are required to in their own regulations and where they said that their procurement information indicated a lack of adequate competition that we wrote and asked for these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.948" offset="7588571">We wanted to get the documents that supported the contentions of the Regional Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.896" offset="7612291">For example, in 1967, Bannercraft performed four contracts, two primes and two subs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.808" offset="7636010">We took the subcontracts on the same price or less than the prime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.686" offset="7655445">Now, if the Board did not renegotiate the prime, but renegotiated us on the same price, they were being penalized for efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.248" offset="7689718">We have a right to examine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.344" offset="7702152">And now, I think the Board will give us that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.937" offset="7716467">I sincerely believe under their regulations, they would give us that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.436" offset="7730469">Maybe they don't want to apply these regulations retroactively but when they tell us we’ve been compared with other contractors, and refused to tell us who they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.131" offset="7761293">When they say that procurement information, procurement documents indicated lack of adequate competition and refused to give us the procurement documents, there’s not much that we can do by way of renegotiation except to say, “Look, we still think we are efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.199" offset="7817509">And we still think that if you will compare us with this primes under whom we perform subcontracts, we can establish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.769" offset="7843840">That’s really what we asked for” Now, how long should the stay be in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.212" offset="7865574">There need not be extensive delay in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.806" offset="7876023">In the first place, with the change in regulations, and the status of Grumman and I understand the status of Grumman to be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.514" offset="7906847">A petition for rehearing by the government was denied the mandate has issued, I thought it was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.166" offset="7929417">Late yesterday afternoon, I heard by telephone that the Government had filed a motion to recall the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.326" offset="7950002">Now, whatever degree of finality that takes away from the case that is its present posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.698" offset="7971527">The case will never rise again even under the Renegotiation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.872" offset="7984274">And this case can never rise with an agency that has Statutory Judicial Review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.948" offset="8220526">A District Court is unlikely to grant an injunction where the distinction is on two or three documents as against the broad denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.271" offset="8253858">Understand what the Board gave me and charged me for was a stack of documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="2101.891" offset="8484362">For this contractor, it’s extremely important because before we go to the Court of Claims, a final order is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.173" offset="8509440">We must post a bond equal to 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.691" offset="8519471">It’s almost like a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.851" offset="8524173">It’s immediately collectible, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.327" offset="8534100">The final order is not the result of a breakdown in negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.161" offset="8549355">It has the effect of a final judgment of a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.133" offset="8561267">We must post a bond of 100% of the amount of the determination in government bonds with the Court of Claims to prevent collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.429" offset="8594495">So at each step of the agency process and in the Court of Claims, the demand can be raised or lowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.493" offset="8618736">Therefore, if we don’t have a fair opportunity to negotiate with the Board and reach agreement, we go to the Court of Claims fully informed, we run the risk of having that $1,400,000.00 go to a $1,700,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.603" offset="8663144">We don’t have opportunity to make a fair judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.534" offset="8674847">But this is not an earth-shaking case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.552" offset="8682998">This is not a case of even any great presidential value in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.333" offset="8702119">Because it would only apply to agencies like the Board and I’m not sure that there are very many that don’t have statutory review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.246" offset="8729704">And secondly, it probably will come up with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.811" offset="8739944">I do want to make one quick reference to Aircraft and Diesel Equipment Corporation which the counsel has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.072" offset="8761051">That case in my judgment affirmed the authority of the District Court to issue an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.286" offset="8785920">Because what the Court said was, the District Court had no jurisdiction in equity and since the appellant had a complete remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.708" offset="8819566">And the complete remedy of law that this Court was talking about was this, Aircraft was a subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.472" offset="8842658">Its prime contractors were withholding money from Aircraft at the direction of the Government based upon a renegotiation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.445" offset="8874527">This Court said to Aircraft, “Sue your prime contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.548" offset="8890932">Your prime contractor hold and we know of no reason why all of the issues that you raised before this Court could not be raised in litigation with your prime contractor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.292" offset="8925936">And this Court would not have go into the light of saying that you have an adequate remedy at law, if they didn’t recognize the inherent equity jurisdiction of the District Court to under limited circumstances issue a very temporary stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.297" offset="8989884">And I emphasize, if the Board had gone back and complied with Grumman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.352" offset="9014126">If the Court please, the first Grumman decision had been entered before this preliminary injunction was held.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.300" offset="10037917">Perhaps the best way for me to put it is not to paraphrase it but to quote one sentence from the Government’s brief because I think if any one sentence in the brief states the issue that warrants the case being here, it’s this one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burton A. Schwalb</label>
            <text syncTime="2506.176" offset="10101447">Of the Government’s main brief, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.657" offset="10111373">And I quote about three quarters of the way down the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.516" offset="10126838">“Accordingly, this is not a situation where Congress has utilized the Board equitable jurisdiction that inheres in Court and where the proposed exercise of that jurisdiction is consistent with the statutory language and policy, the legislative background and the public interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.023" offset="10196846">Now, the reason why this statement is important is that the Freedom of Information Act is silent on the question of whether or not a plaintiff suing under that Act can also enjoin an agency, which is preceding with the procedure to which the documents requested relate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.273" offset="10261838">What do you do in a situation where accord its given equity power in one respect under a statute and the statute is silent as to any other powers of that that District judge now vested with at least partial equity can do, what can he perform?</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.277" offset="10325891">And I think this is why the government must have felt that this issue was important namely: Federal Jurisdiction under a statute creating at least some equity jurisdiction under the circumstances but not stating just how far that jurisdiction goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.165" offset="10393391">Now, if indeed the test is as it seems to be, as the Government set out and as case would seem to set out that when a statute is silent, you don’t assume that there is no further remedy of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.328" offset="10446054">You look at the legislative history of the policy of the public interest etcetera to see whether or not that extra power should be applied in the act namely, employing it or reading it in or inferring it or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.739" offset="10499657">Does it serve a public interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.848" offset="10508121">Does it serve a purpose that Congress had in mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.976" offset="10516689">Because if it does, it should be read in and there’s many a case so holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.223" offset="10537691">And I think this is why the Government has formulated the issue as it has in page 15 talking about legislative history, purpose, and public interest because its conclusion is that what the District Court did below was contrary to the legislative history, to the purpose, and to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.243" offset="10605714">And therefore, that kind of an injunction should not be implied because it undercuts rather than furthers Congressional Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.211" offset="10633613">And if that is the main issue which I think it is then I want to address myself to that in the few minutes that we have left because I think that the equity isn’t clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.737" offset="10667677">The Government counsel has said they are not contesting the matter on their right to document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.313" offset="10681992">That is something that is still left for the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.326" offset="10690038">I think the equities are things that are better left to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.716" offset="10703621">They have been faced once on a preliminary injunction to be faced again if the Court’s case was back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.601" offset="10731102">The legislative history is something that this Court very recently explored in the EPA-Mink case and I don’t intend to spend much time in identifying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.998" offset="10768718">There are basically three documents I would like to refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.291" offset="10785959">The Freedom of Information Act as it now is was Senate Bill 1160 in the Eighty-Ninth Congress First Session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.627" offset="10819291">In the Senate Report number 813 that accompanied that bill said on page 7 as follows, “Requiring the agencies to keep a current index of their orders, opinions, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.362" offset="10870178">It is necessary to afford the private citizen, the essential information to enable him to deal effectively and knowledgeably with the federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.809" offset="10911974">The change will prevent a citizen from losing a controversy with an agency because of some obscure and hidden order or opinion which the agency knows about but which has been unavailable to the citizen simply because he had no way in which to discover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.384" offset="10978325">The House Report which was May 1966 report in the Second Session of the Eighty-ninth Congress, Report number 1497 says very much the same thing, namely, a purpose to prevent a citizen from losing a controversy with an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.356" offset="11046139">Now, in the Eighty-eighth Congress, the prior Congress, the Senate had a similar bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.686" offset="11063484">In fact, I think that I can’t represent it exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.623" offset="11079262">Basically, the same bill came up in the Eighty-eighth Congress and consequently in the Senate, but I think it was passed too late to go to the House so it was renewed in the Eighty-ninth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.165" offset="11113430">But the Senate Report number 1219 which accompanied the bill in the Eighty-eighth Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.592" offset="11143105">At page 3, it said very much the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.165" offset="11157420">They were talking about the old Administrative Procedure Act 3 which permitted disclosure but only if it wasn’t in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.430" offset="11194514">They were decrying the fact that the public interest exception or notion was being used as a shield to disclosure rather than an aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.419" offset="11226384">And said as follows, “retention of such an exception”, we are talking now about that Section 3 of the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.520" offset="11254805">In Section 3 (a) is therefore inconsistent with this section’s general objective of enabling the public readily to gain access to the information necessarily to deal effectively and upon equal footing to the federal agencies.</text>

            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="3269.672" offset="13155474">The legislative history that the counsel pointed to, indicating that one of the intents of the Freedom of Information Act was to prevent people from losing a controversy within agency on a basis of secret information is a discussion, a section of the Act, which requires the indexing of agency opinions and essentially agency case law, the end product of the administrative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.192" offset="13309492">That section requires not only the indexing of these materials but it also provides that none of the materials that’s required to be indexed and has not been indexed may be relied upon as a precedent against anyone who hasn’t been informed of these secret laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.439" offset="13406459">This is quite a different situation from the situation that’s in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.392" offset="13434358">And in effect, there was a specific provision for this specific problem in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.062" offset="13480960">You simply can’t rely on that information or on those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.730" offset="13507709">Also, the contention that the fact that there is no statutory review of the renegotiation procedures here means that in this case, there is jurisdiction under the Freedom of Information Act to enjoin agency procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.570" offset="13623066">This is an incorrect analysis, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.990" offset="13636754">I think that whether or not there’s jurisdiction to review agency procedures goes to the question of the propriety of the exercise of jurisdiction under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.932" offset="13692447">It doesn’t go to the existence of that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.435" offset="13722540">In the Sixth Circuit, and the Sears, Roebuck case found that there was no jurisdiction to enjoin agency proceedings against the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.766" offset="13783771">They also mentioned that there would be a review of the NLRB procedures later but the question is, is really jurisdiction not the exercise of jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.446" offset="13870498">I don’t agree that there it’s clear that the contractors are entitled to any of the information that they have asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.983" offset="13932669">The Grumman case that they referred to the petition for rehearing has been denied but the Government’s time to petition for certiorari hasn’t expired and it would settle some of the issues it wouldn’t settle all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.173" offset="13997453">The fact that performance information is available under the regulations now doesn’t necessarily mean that the performance information supplied earlier in Bannercraft would be since under the new regulations when the Board asks the various contractors to supply the information to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.362" offset="14098181">The request indicates that this information will be made available to the contractor before the request indicated that it would be kept confidential and so there is a question of protecting an assurance of confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.009" offset="14188774">The only other point I had was that once the Statutory Board makes a final determination that is the determination, the contractor can still make a compromise offer and that may be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.360" offset="14250214">It will be considered by the Board if the Board’s action doesn’t become final until it makes an order.</text>
