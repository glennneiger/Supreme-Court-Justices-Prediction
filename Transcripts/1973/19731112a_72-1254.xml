            <text syncTime="48.572" offset="271047">Your Honors, this an appeal from a decision of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in which that Court ruled that the Massachusetts Flag Statute was vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and overly broad in violation of First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.563" offset="343040">The facts in this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.975" offset="356624">On January 30, 1970, Valerie Goguen was seen on the Main Street Leominster Massachusetts with a small American flag approximately three by five inches or four by six inches sewn to the seat of his pants in the area of the left buttock.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.258" offset="429767">A police officer saw him standing on the streets of Leominster and saw a crowd of people with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.442" offset="450560">The police officer approached him and spoke to him about the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.464" offset="466651">Thereafter the police officer went to the Leominster District Court and swore out a complaint charging that Valerie Goguen did treat contemptuously the flag of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.589" offset="511060">Mr. Goguen was tried in the Local District Court and found guilty by a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.926" offset="528405">He exercised his right for a trial de novo to Worcester Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.624" offset="547213">A trial was had before a jury and the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.319" offset="566021">Mr. Goguen was sentence to six months in the House of Correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.136" offset="581277">Execution of this sentence was staid pending his appeal to the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.318" offset="602070">In that appeal the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed the conviction unanimously in a rescript opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.988" offset="1120653">That’s all that the Federal Courts had when they decided this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.869" offset="1136222">On February 23, 1972, we filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus and in June of 1972 the District Court judge granted the writ saying or finding that Mr. Goguen’s constitutional rights have been violated according to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.098" offset="1197140">The First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction or affirmed the granting of the writ, I’m sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.885" offset="1220336">The first point I would press to this Court is the question of whether or not Mr. Goguen properly exhausted his available state remedies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.987" offset="1264744">By that I mean, was it proper for the First Circuit to reach a facial vagueness claim in this case in light of the record and briefs that were filed in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.849" offset="1316153">If you study those briefs and tie them in with the short record it becomes quite clear that the question of whether or not this statute gives fair notice of the conduct it proscribes whether or not that question was raised on the SJC.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.705" offset="1375608">It becomes clear that it wasn’t appellee in his brief to this court tells us that the essence of a Fourteenth Amendment vagueness claim is whether or not fair notice is given and yet if you look at the brief that was filed in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, you will not see a single case cited for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.736" offset="1455647">You will not see an argument developed along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.676" offset="1471425">I do not deny that in the area of First Amendment rights many times vagueness and overbreadth are closely connected and intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.554" offset="1506952">And yet, the question I think before this Court is whether or not it was permissible for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts to handle this case in the way it did relative to Fourteenth Amendment vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.782" offset="1559928">In other words, if you look at the SJ or the Supreme Judicial Court opinion, you will see that they said simply this, “Whatever the uncertainties in other situations, we find no vagueness in the statute as applied here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="384.258" offset="1613740">So the question becomes, should the First Circuit have reached a facial vagueness argument in light of what the Supreme Judicial Court said?</text>
            <text syncTime="394.283" offset="1653864">I think it’s a question of exhaustion in not standing because the Supreme Judicial Court never faced the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.382" offset="1686256">If the issue had impressed to them and they had said, no we find that this man has no standing to raise a facial vagueness argument then the First Circuit’s opinion would have been in line.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.363" offset="1730247">In other words, a discussion of standing to raise facial vagueness but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts never entertained an argument because one was never made to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.810" offset="1767967">Accordingly, we would urge this Court to find that the exhaustion of state remedies was violated when the First Circuit Court reached a facial vagueness claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.174" offset="1809450">Assuming though that the First Circuit Court could consider a facial vagueness claim properly, we submit that that issue was wrongly decided by the First Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.304" offset="1862008">We say that because of the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.955" offset="1876532">This statute when you consider whether or not it is vague on its face has a very narrow subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.910" offset="1904431">It deals with the United States flags.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.668" offset="1915402">It’s not dealing with loitering or noise or annoyance, it’s dealing with flags.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.686" offset="1947481">Now, if a person is going to violate this statute he immediately knows if he wants notice as to what conduct this statute proscribes, he immediately knows that it has something to do with flags.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.280" offset="1993874">Now, if he wants to stay clear of violating this statute, he just has to stay clear of doing something to United States flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.935" offset="2020519">So the subject matter of this statute is uniquely narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.277" offset="2037864">Now, we think that that takes some of vagueness away from the phrase “treats contemptuously” in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.537" offset="5210906">The First Circuit said in so many words that all flag conduct is closely akin to pure speech very close in the opinion of the First Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.072" offset="5305051">It’s very difficult to come up with a valid state reasons as to why this legislation is not directed towards the First Amendment in conduct under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.063" offset="5353012">It seems to me though that from the citations in Massachusetts’ opinion, Massachusetts’ opinion recognized two interests namely, the very diffused meaning of the United States flag for all American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.574" offset="5419050">It can’t be constricted and equated to a promotion of patriotism and loyalty as the First Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.025" offset="5444859">It’s much broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.296" offset="5449979">It includes that but it’s so much broader for all Americans, the flag means so much to -- we constrict and restrict the meaning of the flag just to that I think does deserve as to what the flag means for Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.451" offset="5506508">Number two, as the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court showed, they cited Halter, they cited Chaplinsky and they cited Sutherland v. DeWulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.048" offset="5548931">All of these opinions go to the question of a preservation of the public peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.426" offset="5570456">Now, I know this Court has said say in Cohen versus California that an undifferentiated fear of a disturbance is not enough to restrict First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.179" offset="5605460">But I think when you think about the flag and when you think about the various states that have passed legislation in this area, I think the determination they have made is that flag desecration is the type of conduct that per se is likely to incite a breach of the peace and I think that though there is no evidence in the record before you that an immediate breach of the peace was going to occur, I don’t think that goes to defeat this interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.714" offset="5727608">I think a legislature can make a valid determination that certain types of conduct are so offensive to normal community standards that they’re very likely to create a breach of the peace and that in the interest of the welfare of the community, certain types of conduct can be proscribed such as flag desecration.</text>
