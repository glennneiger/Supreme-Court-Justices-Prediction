            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="57.294" offset="305946">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.627" offset="319216">This case presents two issues for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.943" offset="332487">First, our substantial state welfare subsidy is to strikers which are payable solely because of the strike and impermissible intrusion upon the National Labor Policy of free Collective-Bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.669" offset="383373">And second, whether declaratory judgment action to resolve that important issue is rendered moot when the particular strike, during which the payments are made is settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.122" offset="429244">Notwithstanding that such payments continue and continue to have an effect on both the same employer and other employers in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.611" offset="463203">This case arose in May 14, 1971 when employees of Super Tire Co., who are represented by respondent Teamsters Local 676, struck to obtain an agreement as to their proposals for a new collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.946" offset="524539">During the first 30 days of that strike, many of the strikers received public welfare assistance under a totally state-funded program, New Jersey’s General Public Assistance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.555" offset="570932">Subsequently, after a 30-day waiting period had elapsed, the strikers became eligible for and received assistance under a joint federal-state program, Aid to Families of Dependent Children.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.654" offset="615340">The aided program is no longer in effect in New Jersey and has now been replaced by another totally state-funded program, Aid to Families of the Working Poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.817" offset="648046">This action was filed on June 10, 1971 after the strike had continued for approximately three weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.511" offset="674795">It sought both declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.418" offset="690469">The crux of the case was the issue of whether the Supremacy Clause embodying the Federal Labor Policy precluded the state and federal welfare subsidies to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.422" offset="738429">The argument was that such payments and the availability of such payments violated the National Labor Policy of free Collective-Bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.407" offset="770403">This issue came before the court on June 24, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.985" offset="788689">The company argued two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.310" offset="794018">First, it argued that, as a manner of law, it was correct that there was a substantial state interference by the statute itself, by the regulations itself and, therefore, that was an impermissible intrusion of free and collective-bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.001" offset="840725">It further offered to demonstrate through the testimony of state officials who were present, through the testimony of expert witnesses who were present that there was substantial interference in this particular case with the collective-bargaining relations between Super Tire and Teamster Local 676.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.153" offset="905404">The District Court, however, orally dismissed the case under Rule 12b6 for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.034" offset="928914">Four days later, on June 28, the strike ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.347" offset="942184">The employees returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.601" offset="951171">The company, there upon, appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which, in a lengthy divided opinion, dismissed the appeal as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.032" offset="980846">The basis for the Third Circuit’s opinion was the belief that this court’s decision in Oil Workers v. Missouri required a separate distinct rule for labor cases as opposed to other controversies and that in the labor controversy, at least where the government is a defendant, a finding that settlement of a strike would moot the termination of any issues that could arise as a result of that strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.095" offset="1897117">And, we think that this court either should decide it or, at the very least, provide guidelines for the District Court here if it does remand so the District Court will know how to apply a standard here.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.495" offset="1970678">So, even if the court disagrees with me and finds that there is an incomplete record here and it needs a better record to decide it, I would hope that it would provide some assistance to counsel, such as myself who has to litigate this case throughout the country, and would like to be able to be informed whether the huge test of the First Circuit is applied in Grinnell, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.226" offset="2045701">Is that an appropriate method of proceeding in this area?</text>
            <text syncTime="497.374" offset="2066286">I would like to first address my comments to the mootness argument because that certainly was the basis for the decision below, and the only basis for the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.553" offset="2098991">I think the first consideration in the mootness area is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in saying that there should be a different mootness test for labor controversies or for controversies where the government is a defendant rather than a plaintiff or whether we should have a series of variables that will regulate mootness in cases that come up for appellate review or whether conversely, as we contend, there is an evolving mootness concept most recently articulated in cases such as Sibron and Moore which apply to all cases and govern for disposition of all cases regardless of what field of law is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.617" offset="2235246">The court below, at the outset of its opinion, seemed to indicate that that was the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.261" offset="2249770">They articulated four criteria of mootness which we think are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.177" offset="2269414">They said the test are whether there is a possibility of an effective judicial decree, second, whether the controversy is concrete, third, whether the parties are under sufficiently adverse context to ensure effect of litigation and, finally, apart from all of the other tests whether we fall within Southern Pacific, the Moore test, where this is a recurring controversy that is likely to evade judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.661" offset="2355409">We think that under any of those four standards in this case, we have met each of those four standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.371" offset="2382263">Super Tire sought a declaratory judgment, not an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.316" offset="2398041">Effective decree which regulates the state policy as to both Super Tire and other employers are still possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.600" offset="2423118">Super Tire is going to be affected in the future and that is what it sought to have determined, its rights both present and future by means of a declaratory judgment as to whether the state can engage in the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.538" offset="2466900">There is nothing in this record to show this is a faint or a hypothetical, or an abstract controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.870" offset="2488216">Super Tire was harmed on one occasion, will continue to be harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.425" offset="2502426">Other employers have been harmed and continue to be harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.469" offset="2510576">This is a need for advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.627" offset="2519249">There has been actual injury and a live controversy that has taken place and continues to take place, and that is whether we regard this as a challenge to payment to strikers or availability to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.425" offset="2562403">The parties continue to remain in adverse posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.681" offset="2575464">Super Tire has collective-bargaining agreement contracts up this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.227" offset="2593646">The new negotiations will start.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.965" offset="2600647">There is a possibility of a strike again.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.055" offset="2609006">More than that, we have the fact that over 30% of all strikes in this country take place during a contract term, notwithstanding those strike clauses and the inhibitions on midterm contract strikes of voice market and gateway call.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.075" offset="2669087">The collective-bargaining negotiation is more than something that takes place once every three years and stops the continuing day-to-day ongoing relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.452" offset="2698553">As long as strike benefits are payable to the striker, that is affected by the availability of the New Jersey policies that we challenge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.593" offset="2735125">Both the Firth Circuit in ITT and Grinnell cases, the Three-Judge District Court in Francis, each of these courts was confronted by a mootness contention and in a precise same situation we have here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.457" offset="2778593">And, each of those found the controversy not to be moot and that there was continuing relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.420" offset="2798446">The Third Circuit said one strike with a length requisite to raise the issue has already occurred and nothing in the record suggest the unlikelihood of future repetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.779" offset="2831882">We think that same principle is applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.147" offset="2845362">Finally, this case presents what we believe to be a clear example of the continuing controversy, the type of controversy that might otherwise evade appellate review of the type that this court found to fall within the Southern Pacific and such cases as Moore v. Ogilvie and Roe v. Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.548" offset="2906906">Strikes on the average, as we point out in our reply brief, lasts 11 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.991" offset="2924669">That is even a far shorter time than the period of pregnancy involved in Roe or the two-year ICC orders that were called short-term and evasive of review in Southern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.936" offset="2968451">If this case is found moot, every trailer is the state welfare law is a basis of preemption in the country is likely to be similarly rendered moot before we can have an appellate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.369" offset="3010247">An entire class of cases would be denied review and avenues of appellate decision will be denied for an important state federal controversy in an important preemption area.</text>

            <text syncTime="865.880" offset="3540219">Well, this court has said on occasion that mootness of a preemption issue is a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.470" offset="3570625">So that even if the State Court, for example, had a different rule, this court would still apply its own rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.392" offset="3590269">I think we could go to the New Jersey courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.282" offset="3597897">My feeling was that at that time, that would be a futile act.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.918" offset="3608451">The New Jersey courts have issued and not ruled on this question precisely, but there certainly have been determination by New Jersey officials here.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.538" offset="3638857">We felt that this was presenting squarely an important federal issue that ought to be resolved not just for New Jersey but generally and that, therefore, the appropriate form was rather than go to the New Jersey courts you go to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.292" offset="3685878">And, that is why we commenced this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.366" offset="3694237">Now, the point I was making is that if that is going to be decided as moot, whether by reason of the fact of the strike itself, then there is no way that we are ever going to be able to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.545" offset="3738958">We or any other employer throughout the United States is ever going to get review of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.641" offset="3759334">And going to this court’s opinion in Liner v. Jafco, that is the exact type of situation which should not occur when you are dealing with a preemption problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.187" offset="3801548">Preemption issues are particular problems where the court should be very careful to avoid hindrances in the light of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.766" offset="3827775">And that is what we think, as I say, would be the result here and it would certainly be the result with 11-day average strike period should this court agree with the Third Circuit on mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.849" offset="3872183">Before I turn to the merits, I just wanted to address the Oil Workers case which is the basis for the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.018" offset="3904784">We do not think that case stands for the proposition that there is a distinct or different or new rule for labor controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.075" offset="3933100">Rather we submit that that case which was a situation involving the emergency seizure by the governor of the state which was a discretionary power of a public utility confronted in the labor situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.896" offset="3992346">The crux of that case, we think, are three-fold where it is different from our case, first, the emergency discretionary speculative nature of any reoccurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.769" offset="4023798">Secondly, the fact that if the governor seized another utility and there is no showing that some other plaintiff could not have come in and it did not fall within the Southern Pacific Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.641" offset="4067265">And finally, and perhaps most significantly, the plaintiffs in that case has sought to enjoin only a specific act, mainly the seizure of the utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.592" offset="4095164">They did not seek, as we saw here, a declaratory judgment which would affect future as well as present rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.005" offset="4120764">For all those reasons, we think that the defendant and oil workers perhaps have met this burden of showing that there was no likelihood or reasonable expectation that the wrong would be repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.483" offset="4162664">In this case, we do not think the defendants had met this burden, that there has been continuing irreparable injury that continues to occur as long as there is availability on the books, and that ought to be a controversy this court ought to address.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.677" offset="4431412">The District Court said that there was no way that we could ever prove that welfare payments to strikers constituted a substantial interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.912" offset="4468402">It read the ITT v. Minter case in the First Circuit as ruling out any possibility that we could ever make proof to meet the allegations of our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.861" offset="4504242">Now, subsequently, the First Circuit in Grinnell explicated ITT to say that is precisely what it did not mean ITT to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.735" offset="4531722">So that I think there is no question that the District Court’s reading of ITT, which was the basis of its decision, is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.735" offset="4567667">It was the appeal on that basis, similar to the appeal that the employer took in Grinnell and the same where the District Court did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.399" offset="4594312">That was the basis for appeal and it was four days after the District Court decision that the strike settled and, therefore, raised the mootness controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.902" offset="4624405">That is when the employees returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.868" offset="4632242">Now, there was a statement made at the hearing before the District Court that the employees had ratified the agreement and were going to return to work the next working day which was Monday, 28th, but there was never any contention or argument or finding by the District Court that that mooted the controversy at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.276" offset="4701832">I would like to turn to the merits of the case which, again, I think are significant, worthy of decision, and which this court should either decide or provide significant guidelines for the lower federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.659" offset="5111432">I want to save a few minutes for rebuttal, but I would like to spend some time on merit argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.350" offset="5138181">The federal labor law, we believe the core of the federal labor law is the voluntary private adjustment of disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.672" offset="5163468">The federal labor law has set up a framework which indicates that certain types of conduct in the disposition of disputes certain types of economic pressure by Unions, secondary boycotts, violence, partial strikes are forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.398" offset="5218325">But where there is no such regulation, it is an area which Congress has specifically intended to be free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.705" offset="5239536">Congress, in order to decide which area is to be free and which area is to be prohibited, has weighed the interest of employers, of Unions, of public, and of the employees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.012" offset="5292826">Where the area has been decided to be free, where Congress has not regulated it, then neither the Labor Board in cases such as Porter or American Ship Building, or the states in cases such as Morton may impinge upon that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.639" offset="5343295">In Morton, for example, the state attempted to provide damages for certain types of Union economic pressures which the federal law has held to be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.337" offset="5378090">This court held such damage awards to be impermissible, that the state had interfered with the balance struck by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.315" offset="5405989">Now, we think that principle is similarly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.317" offset="5418005">A state, by insulating one party from the economic disadvantages of the strike, by ailing its treasury on the side of the Union’s economic power has tipped the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.089" offset="5457084">It has affected the balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.944" offset="5704516">You have got other forms of assistance, unemployment compensation for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.089" offset="5717055">It can also kick in and you can have several different benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.029" offset="5740878">I think the important point here, two points before I close.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.404" offset="5758328">The important point here is that New Jersey has created a special rule of law which is applicable only to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.915" offset="5784451">These are benefits that would not be payable to any other person seeking benefits and seeking welfare in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.664" offset="5815380">Anyone else in New Jersey who was physically and mentally capable of taking a job is ineligible for welfare assistance if he refuses to take the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.551" offset="5850906">A striker, by federal law, has a federally protected right to a job and, yet, he is not taking that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.669" offset="5875461">Now, we submit that that is a special exception, not of general application rule as the state would encourage, but a special exception that has been carved out only for strikers and which necessarily affects the area which Congress designed to be free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.527" offset="5930841">The second thing that I think is significant here is that what we are talking about is not something that would have existed and continued to exist before the strike, but something that has tilted the balance right at the status quo before the strike commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.945" offset="5992490">And this type of interference where the state has gone in and created a special policy that applies only to strikers and is a direct interference with state law regardless of the state interest involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.037" offset="6132924">I think the private parties can go in and always assist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.384" offset="6438243">Your Honors, we represent the respondent Teamsters Local Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.870" offset="6452245">By leave of court, we have been permitted to divide our oral argument with the counsel, Deputy Attorney General, who represents the public officials in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.420" offset="6486413">The state has not argued mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.861" offset="6492160">We, however, have argued mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.106" offset="6501146">We would like to make several points, if we may, relative to the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.023" offset="6516820">Initially, Your Honor, we would think that the court, in reviewing this case, should have as its starting point, the complaint which was filed by Super Tire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.100" offset="6549107">If the court examines the complaint, I think the court can see in effect that Super Tire was complaining not about welfare benefits in general, but rather than the granting of welfare benefits to the particular employees of Super Tire during the time that they were on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.354" offset="6610129">And, I think that is rather important sense in effect, I think it puts this particular lawsuit into a certain time frame.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.219" offset="6637610">Additionally, Your Honor, at the hearing below, and I think this is important, Judge Kitchen in the District Court took no testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.788" offset="6663941">However, he did allow oral argument of all counsel and it was at that time that we raised the issue that this case, in effect, was something that the court should not get into under ITT versus Minter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.028" offset="6708872">But we also raise, Your Honor, and I think it is important and it is in the Appendix rather clearly, that we raise the issue of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.661" offset="6735412">We told the court at that time in the Appendix, and I think it is rather clear, that the strike was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.216" offset="6757564">That the day before the hearing, June 23rd, the employees voted to return to work and that the employees were about to go back to work on the next working day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.329" offset="6794031">And then, employer's counsel agreed that the strike had ended and that the employees were making preparation to go back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.264" offset="6817855">So, in effect, what we have is a suggestion of mootness not on appeal, but a suggestion on mootness at the District Court level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.900" offset="6952333">I would simply note that you can also take the opposite view and, in effect, say that a man who exercises his federal right to strike in effect would be discriminated against by the State of New Jersey denying him welfare benefits because the argument has been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.859" offset="7008235">We would go on to ask the Court to particularly examine the rather (Inaudible) opinion of Judge Adams below who pointed out that there are, generally, different kinds of mootness criteria which have been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.359" offset="7058181">We will take issue with counsel for the petitioner who says that the type of case involved is what is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.169" offset="7081378">We think that the particular criteria spelled out by Judge Adams below are somewhat criteria which have always existed but which come up with different results depending on the type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.600" offset="7127144">Judge Adams put particular emphasis upon oil workers, and we think it was well-placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.176" offset="7145430">Oil workers, in effect, concerned a labor dispute where the state seized or the state declared that a private employer was a public employer and, therefore, the employees had no right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.908" offset="7204362">By the time the case got up to this court, the court said that the labor dispute is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.084" offset="7225051">There, we could again say that the court would never really have that kind of a case before it but, yet, three years later, the labor dispute continued in Bus Employees versus Missouri and the court did get an opportunity to review the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.885" offset="7272281">So, what I am suggesting to the court is that we are not faced with the situation where this is continually evading review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.103" offset="7297149">There is a case now pending in the Eastern District Court from Michigan where the strike itself has continued rather for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.154" offset="7329332">So, we are not faced with something which was pointed out in ICC versus Southern Pacific that is going to continually evade review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.330" offset="7362038">Rather, we think this is something that the court should really decline to look at and decline to act upon under the Article 3 clause that we got to have a concrete case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.644" offset="7483350">But then, in Oil Workers, the employees said that they could have a continuing effect upon them since they did not have a right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.351" offset="7510204">But the court said that is somewhat speculative and here too, we think to say that this employer has as continuing controversy and that the case is still alive ignores the realities of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.706" offset="7563598">We, as the Union, have a contract with this employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.463" offset="7606648">We would also point out to the court in Oil Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.677" offset="7615425">Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out a very good point that if the court acted, they could not really issue an effective order because, in effect, in Oil Workers the labor dispute was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.947" offset="7652519">Here too, if the court were to issue an order, it would be ordering the respondent State Officials to do that which they have already done, which is already done with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.614" offset="7687210">They would be ordering them not to make welfare payments to the particular employees involved and, as such, it would be impossible to do anything because, quite frankly, they are no longer making these welfare payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.286" offset="8425848">As I started by indicating prior to the luncheon break, I think that the state is on common grounds with the petitioner in saying that this case on the merits, involves an issue of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.349" offset="8482168">Our area of disagreement, however, is whether in ascertaining that the intent of Congress -- the court should look to the National Labor Relations Act as urged by the petitioner or whether as urged by the state, it should look to the Federal Categorical Assistance Provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.466" offset="8570567">If Congress had not dealt comprehensively with the subject of welfare in the Social Security Act, then it would be arguable certainly that the court should look to the National Labor Relations Act, look to certain underlying principles in the National Labor Relations Act with regard to collective-bargaining, whether or not those principles require a principle of neutrality by the state in labor disputes and whether or not there is an important countervailing state interest, as we certainly would say that there is, in providing assistance to the needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.529" offset="8718838">However, the primary welfare programs in effect in this country today are themselves federal programs enacted by Congress, as was the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.534" offset="8778919">And since the provisions of the Social Security Act, dealing with those welfare programs, specifically outline conditions of eligibility for the receipt of welfare, rather than as to these provisions enacted by Congress, rather than the general provisions of the National Labor Relations Act dealing with collective-bargaining that the court should look in ascertaining whether or not it was the intention of Congress to prevent the payment of welfare to needy individuals who happened to be on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.938" offset="8944536">Now, when you look to the Social Security Act, you find no such expression of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.731" offset="8983719">Rather, with the main Federal Categorical Assistance Program and the one, remaining principal Federal Categorical Assistance Program still in effect in New Jersey, that involving the so-called one-parent household, there are two criteria of eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.782" offset="9075879">One; that a parent be dead, absent from the home, or disabled, and two; that there be the requisite need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.036" offset="9124885">Now for the court to hold that there is a disqualification from the receipt of benefits under this program for strikers, it would, in effect, have to read into the Act, a further condition of eligibility which is simply not in the provisions of the Federal Social Security Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.612" offset="9447236">But, those memoranda indicate that benefits have been paid on the Federal Categorical Assistance Programs but not under state general assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.880" offset="9484225">And it was because there was considerable controversy with respect to state general assistance that we had several bills that went into the state legislation in the middle of the 1950s and, finally, the regulation which has become the focus of this case and which, although by its terms is only applicable to state general assistance, has, as a matter of administrative application, been applied to the Federal Categorical Assistance Programs as well.</text>
