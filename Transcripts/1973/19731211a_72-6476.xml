            <text syncTime="1356.328" offset="5502015">1343, -- this Court has often observed judicial construction of a statute begins by looking at the words of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.674" offset="5531481">The words of 1343 (4) are clear and leave no room for doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.914" offset="5548408">We believe that claims brought under 1983 were intended to be covered by 1343 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.185" offset="5577456">In Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., this Court held that Congress intended to give broad sweeping protection to basic civil rights by the enactment of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.157" offset="5621342">The right to enjoy property, being one of those rights, whether that property be a home, a savings account or even a welfare check, just as a right not to be deprived of property without due process of law is a right secured by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.983" offset="5680692">We maintain so then the right to receive benefits provided by the Social Security Act is a civil right within the meaning of 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.896" offset="5716323">And this -- the court has recently recognized in Moor v. County of Alameda that 1983 is an Act which protects civil rights within the meaning of 1343 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.270" offset="5761776">Other courts specifically addressing themselves to this question have reached the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.057" offset="5781002">Only the Second Circuit has rejected 1343 (4) jurisdiction, but has done so without any rationale or reasoning for its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.673" offset="5823425">In the court below, the court concluded that there was no jurisdiction and 1343 (4) jurisdiction but dismissed the case on the basis of Almenares v. Wyman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.590" offset="5871073">Almenares v. Wyman, a Second Circuit case determined that there was jurisdiction because of a substantial constitutional claim but in dicta reject the 1343 (4) jurisdiction. Citing, McCall v. Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.455" offset="5930527">McCall v. Shapiro did discuss 1343 (4) jurisdiction, found no basis for jurisdiction but did so on the basis of the personal liberties property rights distinction which this Court was later to reject the Lynch v. Household Finance, thus it's clear that the Second Circuit has yet to come up with any convincing rationale for rejecting 1343 (4) jurisdiction to 1983 suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.722" offset="6023628">The state argues that the one roadblock to jurisdiction, to 1343 (4) jurisdiction is a brief description in a House report accompanying the Bill which describes it as merely a technical amendment to a proceeding section of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.829" offset="6084023">We submit that that limited view is not accurate since the proceeding section of law to which it was -- to which it refers was specifically eliminated by floor amendment and was not enacted into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.082" offset="6141074">Even had that section been enacted in to law, it’s clear that the plain words of 1343 (4) go far beyond the ascribed purpose of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.056" offset="6172944">Congress surely intended the Act to mean something that would -- the Senate would not have passed the section of law to refer to a preceding section that knowingly rejected some further indication of the purpose of 1343 (4) can be gleaned from the very title itself which is an Act to strengthen civil rights enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.219" offset="6269597">It's only if the interpretation that we suggest be given to it that it can be considered an act enlarging and enhancing federal civil rights importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.446" offset="6302511">This Court has already interpreted 1343 (4) as expansive of federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.424" offset="6322469">In the case of Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer, a private corporation was sued for discrimination and refusing to sell a home to a person because he was a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.102" offset="6361130">1343 (4) was the only statute available to provide jurisdiction over a private suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.307" offset="6385998">The Supreme Court in the 1982, this Court found jurisdiction under 1343 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.627" offset="6407210">If the state is correct that 1343 (4) is too technical a provision to provide jurisdiction to 1983, it surely would be too technical to provide jurisdiction for 1343 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.337" offset="6462067">We submit further that 1343 (3) provides an independent basis for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.610" offset="6491220">1343 (3) and 1983 were intended so the legislative history shows to be coextensive in scope and that Congress never intended to create any gap between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.121" offset="6541270">Moreover, 1983 is an Act that protects equal rights since it guarantees a federal forum -- equal access to a federal forum to secure those rights, secured by federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.617" offset="7423164">At issue in this case is the regulation of the New York State Department of Social Services in which the state makes an additional rent payment to welfare recipient that is over and above the regular shelter allowance which that recipient would recede and then recoup it over a period of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.855" offset="7496202">The requirements for this regulation is that the recipient for whatever reason misallocate his or her regular shelter allowance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.599" offset="9199177">And they claim laws include a Social Security Act and therefore they have a right to come into Federal Court to -- at least allege a federal cause of action under 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="2299.170" offset="9273469">The change that occurred in 1871 Act came during the revision when the 1866, 1870, 1871 Acts were all codified together and clarified and put into one provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.779" offset="9367824">It would appear that he was referring to the laws that were included in that whole civil rights package which were in essence the 1866 Civil Rights Act and the 1870 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.063" offset="9412963">There is no basis in the history of the Civil Rights Act that Congress ever intended to create a federal cause of action for every conceivable federal statute that would ever come into existence aside from statutes that enforce the Thirteenth to Fourteenth and the Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.001" offset="9480777">In fact, the only Supreme Court case that ever considered this issue as to what the scope of “and laws” what was a 1900 Supreme Court case and it held that this language did not apply at least to a patent rights case, holding that 1983 applied to civil rights only, at least showing that the Supreme Court in 1900 believed that 1983 was a failing narrow statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.549" offset="9582968">Now when this Court has spoken of 1983 in terms of the rights that it protects, it has spoken of protection of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.703" offset="9615569">And this Court has never held 1983 to its literal language as witnessed in the case of Tenney versus Brandhove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.457" offset="9642527">I think it is important to note, that when Congress passes a federal statute they generally provide their own remedy within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.126" offset="9681293">The Social Security Act when it was passed provided no remedy in Federal Court for recipients of AFDC benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.903" offset="9720372">And I would suggest that there was no reason why Congress which always provides its own remedies when it passes any new statute would pass a statute which creates a federal cause of action as to every conceivable future federal law in any field whatever, banking, tax, it makes no difference simply because state action might be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.981" offset="9800620">There was just no reason why Congress would pass this statute and there is no reason to give the language of “ and laws “ in 1983, the broad interpretation that petitioners want to give and that this Court has stated in dicta might apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.502" offset="9858717">I would suggest that even if 1983 is as broad as petitioner say it is and if it includes every single federal law, it is clear that Congress did not provide jurisdiction in the Federal Courts to hear this course of action because the language of 1343 (3) is narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.415" offset="9938442">It says deprivation of rights secured by the constitution and if any Act of Congress providing the equal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.353" offset="9970207">Now the history of that clause is also very unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.546" offset="9986926">In the 1874 codification the District Court had jurisdiction over rights secured by any law, the Circuit Court on the other hand had rights secured by any law providing for equal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.810" offset="10031961">These were probably meant to be concurrent because the basis of this was the same the 1866 Act which did provide concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.655" offset="10059337">I have shown it in my brief that this address was note on the Circuit Court provision that chose it was intended to be narrowly applied to equal rights statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.262" offset="10093819">And in 1911, Congress explicitly shows the equal rights language which shows a clear intent of Congress that it at least believed that the original jurisdiction was limited to equal rights provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.376" offset="10150243">Now it is very interesting that the petitioners have come to this Court and it really changed the whole thrust of their argument because in the lower courts they were arguing at the Social Security Act, was the Act of Congress providing for equal rights or the Act of Congress providing for civil rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.538" offset="10202906">Now they’ve changed the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.412" offset="10210429">They say that 1983 itself is such an Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.524" offset="10226834">And I would suggest that this is really bootstraps argument because 1983 is a procedural statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.779" offset="10247837">It creates a cause of action where someone is deprived of rights that are enumerated somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.464" offset="10274586">It is in the words of 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.700" offset="10283572">The civil action authorized by law to be commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.582" offset="10295066">That’s right on the first line of 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.301" offset="10305933">It is not the Act, the substantive act providing for equal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.005" offset="10320771">If in fact 1983 were an Equal Rights Act, there’d be a lot of problems just on the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.807" offset="10347938">Number one, it would be inconsistent to say that 1983 is the authorizing law and at the same is a substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.628" offset="10375210">Number two, you'd have a complete redundancy here if 1983 is an Equal Rights Act because 1343 (3) refers to rights secured by the constitution, which means that the language of 1343 (3) would be redundant if it includes 1983 which already refers to rights secured by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.527" offset="10450860">All Congress would need to have done would just be to say there is jurisdiction under any equal rights statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.719" offset="10471654">There’d be no reason even to mention constitution if 1983 is brought down into the jurisdictional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.158" offset="10497358">And thirdly, I would say incongruously if 1983 is an Equal Rights Act, its language and laws is much too broad to encompass itself within that narrow definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.178" offset="10541453">I think the key to this case is the decision in Georgia versus Rachel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.293" offset="10557962">Because they are dealing with the same language in the removal statute this court held that the term any law providing for equal rights was narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.431" offset="10598504">It meant laws dealing with historic equal rights and specifically said, it did not mean 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.178" offset="10625463">That’s within the language of that opinion and I think its very interesting to note that both 1443, which is the removal statute and 1343 (3) which is the statute at issue here derive from the same provision of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which is Subsection 3, the very same provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.072" offset="10709055">It would seem that if 1443 was that narrow, 1983 which was codified, the exact same year as 1443 must have the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.786" offset="10751896">I would also suggest that if Congress was so concerned about passing 1343 (4) ninety years later just to add the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.970" offset="10780630">They evidently also considered the phrase, equal rights to have a very narrow meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.413" offset="10802364">And in fact, I would point out that the history of 1343 (3) shows that the “and laws” language of 1983 was probably meant to be more limited than this court had hinted it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.104" offset="10849176">Now, the petitioners also argue that somehow rather in 1957, Congress passed a new jurisdictional provision to the Civil Rights Act, 1343 (4) which somehow changed the course of all civil rights jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.739" offset="10907690">The jurisdictional provision there is an Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights including the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.923" offset="10936424">Well, what does this really mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.678" offset="10943425">Civil rights including the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.787" offset="10955860">And if you look to see what Congress was really trying to do here, you’ll see essentially that what was at stake in 1957 was a voting rights act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.266" offset="10989819">The House report called this particular provision as a technical amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.172" offset="11005388">The House debate only dealt with what they called civil rights and specifically included by rulings of the House Chairman, economic rights of which we are obviously dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.790" offset="11047915">The Senate debate is even more interesting because it limits itself solely to voting rights because of a very strong reaction on the part of those Senators favoring state's rights, that this particular vote Civil Rights Act of 1957 might be too broad because historically this would be the first Civil Rights Act that was passed since reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.471" offset="11130671">The provision to keep in this -- what became 1343 (4) was proposed by a similar case of South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.319" offset="11158047">And he throughout the debates states that the reason he wants this provision in is because it deals wholly and he says that wholly with the establishment of the jurisdiction of Federal Courts toward the state suits relating to the right to vote and just the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.436" offset="11222518">I think that what you have here with 1343 (4) is a Act which creates jurisdiction in the Federal Courts to hear suits relating to the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.502" offset="11262746">Congress was very uncertain as to what the jurisdictional limits of 1343 (3) were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.145" offset="11289287">And they were clarifying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.287" offset="11293884">In fact the caption is very interesting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.861" offset="11304229">The caption of 1343 just says civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.399" offset="11318335">When this caption -- when 1343 (4) was added in 1957, the caption was amended to say civil rights and elective franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.940" offset="11356473">That was all that was added.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.921" offset="11364415">So what you have here essentially when you deal with civil rights in 1343 (4) is the same rights that were in 1343 (3) except that it includes the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.571" offset="11411017">Now, it is true that 1343 (4) does not include --</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.670" offset="11671406">And also 1343 (4) provides a right of action not under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.746" offset="11695752">Because 1971, the voting rights act was amended provided for the Attorney General to bring suits against private individuals acting under color of state law or not under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.065" offset="11740996">And this was one of the reasons why they had to put in some different provision to allow for these suits to be brought in Federal Court without a jurisdictional amount not under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.101" offset="11785195">But I don’t believe there's anything in the history of 1343 (4) which suggests that the subject matter of the Civil Rights Act was being expanded anymore than the debates indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.938" offset="11836500">I would suggest that the rights of 1343 (4) are no greater than the rights of 1343 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.829" offset="11872026">And that Congress never intended that Federal Courts have jurisdiction over suits that arise under the AFDC provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.564" offset="11911001">It’s very interesting that when the Social Security Act was passed in 1935, there was jurisdiction provided in the Federal Courts for claims arising under the old age provisions but not under the Aid to Dependent Children Provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.005" offset="11976725">This evidences and intends on the part of Congress that the Federal Courts were not going to hear every single minor, AFDC claim outside of the general federal question, jurisdiction of 1331 which is not at issue here because there is no claim that $10,000.00 is in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.817" offset="12063974">Now, I would like to point out that because there is no jurisdiction under the Social Security Act per se and Congress never intended it to be jurisdictional under the Social Security Act per se that the only issue left in this case is whether this Court can hear it by virtue of this claim being pendent to a substantial constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.223" offset="12141610">And that was the issue which the Second Circuit decided when they held no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.750" offset="12155716">That constitutional claim is not substantial and therefore we don’t have jurisdiction to decide this pendent claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.196" offset="12185496">The standard they use and the standard that it obviously applies here is the test, obviously without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.492" offset="12210678">This Court has used it all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.126" offset="12217260">The standard did not change with Goosby versus Osser but was reaffirmed there and I think if you look at the equal protection violation here, it's frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.738" offset="12255713">What are they claiming?</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.731" offset="12259683">They’re claiming -- they are claiming that they are getting more money one month and less money the next month and that somehow -- rather they are being treated as a violation of equal protection but the essence of equal protection is equal treatment and they are being treated exactly equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.811" offset="12328020">They receive a duplicate payment to which they are not entitled and to which nobody else gets at the subsequent month or the subsequent six months, they pay back this duplicate payment to be put in the exact same effect as any other welfare recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.672" offset="12395416">In fact, I would suggest that if this is a constitutional claim of any substance and if petitioners were to prevail here it would be just as substantial for any other recipient who did not get the recoupment claim to bring a civil rights action in this Court and claim with denial of equal protection because they don’t get extra payments and they have to live within a tight budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.993" offset="12496771">I think that the Second Circuit clearly determined this to be frivolous because as the Second Circuit says, the purposes of equal protection are served by treating all alike without granting special favor to those who have misappropriated their rent allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.837" offset="12564062">Now, since this claim is obviously without merit as it must be, there is obviously on any minimal rational basis test, a state can allocate its limited funds so that every recipient receives an equal share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.291" offset="12621949">And we don’t put this thing into encourage mismanagement or discourage mismanagement, that’s not the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.572" offset="12650998">The issue is that we are trying to treat all of these recipients equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.988" offset="12668656">We are not required to give them this extra rent allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.207" offset="12685584">We can’t allow them to be evicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.889" offset="12692271">There is no federal constitutional or even statutory requirement that we say to this people look, if you choose to stay in the same house and not go through the vicissitudes of eviction, we have to do this for you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.466" offset="12746606">But we are doing it because we feel that eviction is a very traumatic experience for welfare recipients.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.769" offset="12783804">And there is certainly nothing unreasonable about this sort of approach to give people extra moneys to help them out and then to take the moneys back so that we can in effect treat them the same as any other welfare recipient.</text>
