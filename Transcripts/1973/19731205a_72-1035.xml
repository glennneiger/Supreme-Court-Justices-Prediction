            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We'll resume arguments in Rogers against Loether.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.925" offset="108460">Mr. Scott, you have 21 minutes left.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Scott</label>
            <text syncTime="10.610" offset="119223">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.340" offset="134060">Yesterday afternoon in the course of his discussion of this case, my distinguished opposing counsel, in response to a question by the Chief Justice conceited that if this case is in fact in a nature of a common law action then it cannot escape the reach of the preservative power of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.538" offset="222877">When court adjourned yesterday afternoon, in response to another question by the Chief Justice, I was responding to how the Seventh Amendment test may be applied to the particular circumstances of this case and I would like to pursue that further this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.933" offset="296438">When we adjourned yesterday, I had concluded my discussion with regard to the first test announced by this court in Ross versus Bernhard, namely, how the circumstances of this case compared -- contrast with the premerger custom of the Federal Courts with respect to like issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.519" offset="382851">And, I suggested to the court the test proposed by Justice Story in Parsons versus Bedford to the effect that the Seventh Amendment reaches all cases which are not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction and I also suggested that the literal approach be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.964" offset="456620">And I would pass on now to the other two tests which were announced in Ross versus Bernhard, namely, what type of relief is requested and, thirdly, third test being the practical abilities and limitations of juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.269" offset="525793">The second test, I think, is particularly applicable to this case and this goes back to a question that Justice Brennan asked me yesterday afternoon with respect to what type of relief was asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.749" offset="571768">I recall the Justice asking whether or not actual damages had been asked for in the complaint and the record shows, I believe, that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.105" offset="605205">However, they did enter the case by way of a pretrial order after the first pretrial conference and, in all subsequent pretrial orders issued by the District Court, this case was announced to be one on damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.174" offset="665496">And when it came time for this case to be decided after the trial had been concluded, and I am referring specifically to page 51 (a) of the Appendix, at the top of that page, the District Court said, "Now, we come to the question, the questions of damages."</text>
            <text syncTime="165.408" offset="738429">Further down in that page the District Court said, "I do not believe there had been any compensatory damages proven in this case or out of pocket expenses of that nature."</text>
            <text syncTime="178.510" offset="790779">And so he rejected the claim for compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.905" offset="804362">There had been a trial on compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.821" offset="816065">All the evidence elicited by the plaintiff on direct testimony had related to actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.989" offset="840725">The plaintiff offered no testimony with respect to the other issue that was being tried, namely the issue of discrimination, because the court had incorporated the testimony that had been elicited at the time of the preliminary injunction on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.921" offset="900389">Practically, the entire testimony in that two days of trial related to the question of the extent to which if at all, the plaintiff had sustained any actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.468" offset="942602">And in the final analysis, very specifically, the trial court rejected that claim and went on to award punitive damages in the amount of $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.423" offset="986488">And this was a -- this topic was a source of some discussion when this case was argued before the Seventh Circuit and at that time, opposing counsel for the plaintiff conceited to the Seventh Circuit that actual damages were in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.290" offset="1041868">Now, why is this important with respect to the second issue in Ross versus Bernhard?</text>
            <text syncTime="247.625" offset="1067259">You look to see what type of relief is requested, particularly at the time when the availability of a jury becomes important to determine the reach of the Seventh Amendment at least in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.793" offset="1111876">And there are two reasons at least why the type of relief requested is important to the jury issue cause it goes to the abilities of juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.044" offset="1148970">And I'd point this out that we had two claims for money damages; actual damages, punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.798" offset="1171958">Both of those are issues that juries are particularly responsive to particularly in determining the extent of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.358" offset="1206230">This is one area where Appellate Courts, I find are laws overturn, the finding of juries because that is one of their particular strengths and I think there is probably no damage issue at law that calls upon the common sense judgment of jurors more than the question of whether, and to what extent, punitive damages should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.355" offset="1298181">Both of these damage issues were before us at the time the jury trial issue became critical.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="310.823" stopTime="319.420">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="310.823" offset="1320020">Would you say that, in this respect, there are some analogies between this kind of an action and a libel or slander suit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_scott" startTime="319.420" stopTime="514.818">
            <label>Mr. Robert Scott</label>
            <text syncTime="319.420" offset="1354397">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.564" offset="1358994">And Mr. Chief Justice, I referred specifically to those types of action in my brief and to the fact that previously this court has held, and I think, specifically in Ross versus Bernhard, those types of issues were mentioned as ones to which the Seventh Amendment reaches, in which the jury right is preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.217" offset="1461603">We pass on, if I may, to the third test in Ross versus Bernhard.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.947" offset="1484487">This is the test which was described as being the practical abilities and limitations of juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.653" offset="1515311">I feel, in some regard, this is the real battleground to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.895" offset="1536313">That test is -- as I read Ross, was not applied in Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.962" offset="1556584">In my brief, I suggested that the test includes at least two considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.497" offset="1578736">One is the consideration of whether or not juries, given the particular issues that are going to be tried, can deal competently and justly with those particular issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.839" offset="1620114">Brings in the question of whether or not the issues are very complicated or, for other policy reasons, might best be withdrawn from juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.027" offset="1652820">And I would suggest there is another consideration included in that third criteria set down in Ross, namely, whether or not this particular cause of action with a jury trial right attached to it will frustrate any particular statutory purpose or frustrate any particular statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.922" offset="1744457">And I am thinking particularly in this regard of Katchen, and I will get to that point after discussing the first consideration, if I may, because I want to suggest that in terms of the competence of juries this case is an excellent example of just the type of issue that should go to jury consideration because what's going to be tried here are questions of credibility and motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.924" offset="1840483">This trial, on the discrimination issue particularly, involved whether or not at the time Leroy Loether determined not to rent one of the two flats in the two-flat home that he happened to own to the plaintiff, whether or not at that time his motivation was based on race or based solely on other considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.253" offset="1929718">Leroy Loether testified at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.082" offset="1941107">His wife testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.961" offset="1948630">To the -- two of them owned the house together.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.036" offset="1964931">And what was called upon for a determination of the discrimination issue was a testing of their credibility, and this is an area where there is particular strength of jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.482" offset="2030655">The question was whether or not he had a racial motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.250" offset="2057718">He said he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.921" offset="2064405">He said it was because of something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.460" offset="2074540">He said if the same circumstances had been presented and District Judge Reynolds had been the applicant for the apartment, he would have refused him in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.280" offset="2121874">This was his testimony on cross-examination at the time of trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.647" offset="2179344">That's right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.942" offset="2196480">In further response to that, I believe we've made that concession down the line in the previous hearings on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.996" offset="2228767">Injunctive relief was asked for at the outset and just -- to put this a little bit in perspective, a temporary restraining order was asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.837" offset="2264085">It was granted before the first hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.782" offset="2275892">A preliminary injunction was requested to follow up the TRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.910" offset="2292402">We had a hearing on the preliminary injunction and that injunction was granted by order of the District Court on December 19, 1969 very briefly after the action had been started in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.420" offset="2346423">The following month, in January of 1970, we were advised in a pretrial conference that the plaintiff no longer wish to occupy the apartment and at that time, a proposal was made with the court's concurrence that the matter be resolved by renting to any black family or any black individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.997" offset="2420715">And, at the time we returned to argue the jury trial issue to the District Court in April 1970, the plaintiff's counsel reported back that that particular offer had been rejected by the plaintiff and at that time, the injunctive relief was abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.316" offset="2502008">And so when this case went to trial, there was nothing in the way of injunctive relief that was requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.512" offset="2526772">All that was asked for by way of relief was in terms of money damages, both punitive and compensatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.131" offset="3789322">That issue was avoided by the Seventh Circuit, by another reading of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.590" offset="3815131">And to a certain extent, their position was supported by the only legislative history that has been brought into this record and that is the testimony of the Attorney General Katzenbach at the time this case or this issue -- that the statute was an issue before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.578" offset="3883050">And, I refer specifically to the petitioner's brief at page 15 and 16 where Senator Irvin asked whether or not there would be any objection to having the statute amended to spell out that a man has a right to have the issues of fact tried to a jury when there's a damage issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.464" offset="3986599">And, the Attorney General said, "No."</text>

            <text syncTime="984.307" offset="4013976">That's the only legislative history we've got in the record on this case and I think it supports an appropriate reading of 812 and that is that it's silent on the jury trial issue and you can avoid ruling that that statute is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.618" offset="4219193">And I distinguish in my brief the Katchen case on the basis of the facts in that case, namely, what the court was dealing with, there was a very specific summary type of proceeding. .</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.705" offset="4331520">The distinction was made in that case by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.354" offset="4350119">And I believe the distinction is important to our case because what we have here is a civil action established by Congress as such with all of the (Inaudible), an ordinary lawsuit accompanying it at the time of trial, pretrial conferences, pretrial orders, or regular trial, not a summary proceeding, an informal proceeding such as that provided for in the bankruptcy statute for summary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.838" offset="4484075">The petitioner in this case has said that Katchen was dispositive of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.060" offset="4508944">As a matter of fact, Katchen and NLRB versus Jones &amp; Laughlin are quite distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.037" offset="4532872">They involve what was referred to in NLRB versus Jones &amp; Laughlin as a statutory proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.078" offset="4569025">We have a civil action very much like an ordinary lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.446" offset="4602567">It's interesting to note that the statute that we're talking about here provides for an alternate proceeding that is really quite a bit more like the summary proceeding than our civil action we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.546" offset="4650945">And that's the proceeding by which an aggrieved party can apply to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for conciliation and it provides the Secretary with a vast panoply of discovery procedures, subpoena, power to get at the heart of whatever the dispute is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.317" offset="4730044">That path was not chosen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.441" offset="4738508">Instead, the petitioner started a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.765" offset="4759824">For that reason, upon their choice of trying their case in District Court as a civil action with questions of damages attached, we would strongly urge this court to affirm the unanimous opinion below and to return this case for a trial by jury in accordance to the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.986" offset="4872673">May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.858" offset="4876225">We submit that in Title 8 Congress has created a single integrated equitable remedy, out of which a court might fashion relief appropriate to particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.624" offset="4923246">That remedy consists of various parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.691" offset="4935471">Statute says the court may issue temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, may appoint counsel, may foster conciliation, may award compensatory damages, may award punitive damages, may award costs, and may award counsel fees or all or none of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.380" offset="5006315">Now, the fact that money damages is part of it, the entire remedy does not necessarily make it legal as Jones &amp; Laughlin demonstrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.960" offset="5040588">A judge is suppose to pick and choose among these various aspects of the remedy and harmonize them in a manner appropriate to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.369" offset="5078204">And it's instructive to look at just what the judge did in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.912" offset="5100356">He granted a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.260" offset="5109760">He granted a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.597" offset="5119164">He urged settlement discussions which went on for many months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.507" offset="5130762">So long, in fact, that Mrs. Rogers had to take a new apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.663" offset="5147376">He denied compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.271" offset="5157825">He granted punitive damages and in doing that, he took into account the fact that the respondent had been denied rent for the apartment for a period of 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.330" offset="5198054">He denied attorney fees and he denied costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.555" offset="5211011">He engaged in the typical kind of balancing that a chancellor engages in and, indeed, he referred to the fact that he had had a very difficult case before him and it would take as -- he said, the wisdom of a Solomon to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.106" offset="5273182">And indeed, in the second hearing that he had, he incorporated all the evidence that was taken at the first hearing on temporary restraining order rather on preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.300" offset="5321979">And that is something that could not have been done with a jury and, if one imagines, interposing a jury into this complicated delicate process which has been confided to the judge and which he actually exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.806" offset="5376000">It -- the -- it's easy to imagine just how terribly confused the whole thing could be.</text>
