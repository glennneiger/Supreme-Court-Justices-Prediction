            <text syncTime="10.544" offset="118909">We are here of course on certiorari to the Fourth Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.664" offset="139389">We represent Bob Jones University which is a unique university.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.374" offset="162273">It has a slogan, “The world’s most unusual university.”</text>
            <text syncTime="24.937" offset="176483">I think it can safely be said that that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.529" offset="190903">It is a university which has deep religious backgrounds, deep religious roots.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.683" offset="219429">Its -- every class is opened and closed with prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.992" offset="236669">The university admission’s policy requires an examination into the religious beliefs of those who apply and who are admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.487" offset="270733">One of the religious beliefs of the university is that the scriptures prohibit the intermarriage of the races and that it would be scripturally wrong for members of different races to marry.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.220" offset="333636">Based upon that religious belief which has been its belief since the commencement of the university in 1927, I believe, it has refused admissions to blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.207" offset="393613">It has admitted a few Orientals under a rule that says those who are admitted cannot date members of other races while at the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.609" offset="443141">The university feels that at the college level is when most romantic attachments are formed between parties and when their life’s partners are frequently chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.312" offset="494028">For that reason, it has adhered to the policy that no blacks are admitted to the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.604" offset="527151">Now, certainly since 1942, the university has been an exempt organization under the provisions of 501 (c) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="122.709" offset="567589">It has met all the requirements of 501 (c) (3) as set forth by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.704" offset="595592">Those requirements are briefly that the organization be one who’s chief activity is religious, educational, or charitable that its operations in Europe to the private profit of no one and that it not engage in any substantial lobbying activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.444" offset="686498">There's never been any question but at Bob Jones University, it met all of those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.703" offset="707605">In the letter from the collector in 1943 or 42, it was stated that it was entitled to a tax exempt status and that such tax exempt status would continue unless there was some change in the operations of the university.</text>
