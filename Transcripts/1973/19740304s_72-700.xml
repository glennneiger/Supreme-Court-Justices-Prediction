            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">Thank you, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2.013" offset="84846">The disposition in 72-1297 and 72-700, Johnson against Robison and Hernandez against Veterans Administration will be announced by Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.339" offset="134060">The Veteran's Readjustment Act of 1966 provides educational assistance benefits for draftees inducted into the Armed Forces and also for conscientious objectors also inducted into the Armed Forces who serve with the troupes on non-combatant duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.686" offset="223504">The Act does not, however, provide educational assistance benefits for draftees classified 10, that is conscientious objectors who perform required alternative civilian service, for example, the two year service perform by appellee in Johnson v. Robison at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.793" offset="331964">Because appellee was an alternative civilian service performer, the Veteran's Administration denied his application for educational assistance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.761" offset="379820">Appellee there upon challenged the constitutionality of the pertinent provisions of the Veterans Readjustment Act in this action brought in the District Court for Massachusetts, alleging that the provisions as applied to deny him benefits, violated his First Amendment guarantees of religious freedom and his Fifth Amendment guarantee of equal protection laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.726" offset="483683">The Veteran's Administration sought dismissal of the suit on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because 38 U.S.C. Section 211 (a) prohibits judicial review of decisions of the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.861" offset="548153">The District Court held that 211 (a) was inapplicable to suit, contesting the constitutionality of provisions of the Act and denied that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.464" offset="590576">On the merits, the District Court held that appellee's First Amendment claim was without merit, but sustained appellee's equal protection claim and entered a declaratory judgment that the challenged sections violated the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.466" offset="662570">We agree that Section 211 (a), did not bar appellee's suit and also agree that appellee's First Amendment claim is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.938" offset="704470">We disagree, however, that the contested sections deny appellee equal protect laws and therefore reverse of the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.503" offset="742713">Mr. Justice Douglas dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.069" offset="765074">In Hernandez, 72-700, a companion case to Johnson v. Robinson, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of an action brought by a conscientious objector who performed out alternative civilian service on the ground that 28 -- 38 U.S.C. 211 (a) barred the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.013" offset="864758">Since we have held today in Johnson and Robison that 211 (a) does not bar such suits, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion in Johnson v. Robison.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.061" offset="924944">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed an opinion, concurring in result for the reason stated in his dissenting opinion in Johnson v. Robinson.</text>
