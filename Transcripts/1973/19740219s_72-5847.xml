            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.228" offset="117656">This case is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.362" offset="138240">The petitioner, a black employee was discharged by the respondent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.188" offset="161541">Petitioner claimed racial discrimination and through his union, initiated arbitration proceedings under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.347" offset="202188">That agreement prohibited racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.918" offset="220369">After hearing, the arbitrator ruled that petitioner's discharge was for a cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.890" offset="248268">The petitioner that pursued remedies under Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.771" offset="279824">Following unfavorable action by EEOC, petitioner instituted this suit in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.541" offset="318903">That court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, holding that petitioner was bound by the prior arbitral decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.132" offset="365296">The question presented to us is whether under Title 7, one who has sought relief by arbitration pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and who has lost, may nevertheless obtain a de novo trial for the discrimination issue in a federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.286" offset="449933">We hold that he may.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.423" offset="458397">That the statutory right to such a trial is not foreclosed either by waiver or by the doctrine of election of remedies, but the federal court may admit the arbitral decision in evidence and accord to it such weight as maybe appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.098" offset="549094">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed.</text>
