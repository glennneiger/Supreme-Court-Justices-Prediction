            <text syncTime="57.742" offset="307722">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.869" offset="324232">This matter is before this Court on a writ certiorari to review the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court, upholding the Louisiana statutory procedure of sequestration.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.853" offset="376163">The issue presented by the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court and by the arguments of respondent is whether the decision of this Court in Fuentes v. Shevin should be applied to the Louisiana procedure of sequestration.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.300" offset="433946">A procedure without any constitutionally significant references from the procedures and of Florida and Pennsylvania, a statutory replevin found unconstitutional in Fuentes v. Shevin.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.118" offset="489221">Mitchell is not asking this Court for a novel holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.221" offset="505626">The key facts in this case are brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.454" offset="518583">On February 2, 1972, Grant filed a money claim in the First City Court in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.460" offset="558602">That claim alleged $574.00 to -- against the purchase price of four appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.080" offset="589113">In conjunction with that money claim, Grant requested that a seizure by writ of sequestration be authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.267" offset="625789">In support of that request for seizure by sequestration, Grant filed a short affidavit which verified the petition and a surety bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.045" offset="684931">The judge authorized the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.729" offset="695693">The seizure could take place immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.692" offset="707500">As was true in Fuentes, the writ of sequestration issued upon the minimal showing the verified petition and affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.978" offset="752640">As was true in Fuentes, it issued only by the -- with the filing of a surety bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.255" offset="781793">As was true in Fuentes, the issuance of the writ of sequestration is a ministerial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.991" offset="804676">It is the mandatory duty of the issuing official to issue the writ of sequestration if the documents presented to him are proper on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.728" offset="847621">The document need only show on its face, a claim, in this case the $574.00 money claim alleged to be due on four appliance purchased 11 to 19 months prior to the initiation of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.801" offset="903941">Document need only show an interest of the claimant and the property to be seized, in this case, and unrecorded statutory lien was asserted and third, the document need only show the defendant’s power over the property to be seized, in this case, delivery of the goods to Mitchell was alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.821" offset="992026">The procedure is broadly available to every plaintiff who is willing to make these averments.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.118" offset="1017208">Once the writ of sequestration is authorized, the seizure may take place immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.106" offset="1041136">As in Fuentes, there are only post-seizure procedures available to the dispossessed parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.252" offset="1069767">As in Fuentes, those procedures came too late, the depravation has already occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.096" offset="1101113">However, to put this case in the proper perspective, I’ll briefly go through the post seizure procedures which Mitchell pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.409" offset="1142387">The dispossessed party may defend both against the money claim and against the seizure, in this case, Mitchell sought to dissolve the seizure first.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.069" offset="1188989">Mitchell alleged state grounds, state exemptions statute, he argued applied it to certain of the appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.714" offset="1211559">Mitchell also asserted at the Due Process Clauses of Louisiana and the United States Constitutions protected him against this seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.717" offset="1259624">A hearing was held, both parties appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.163" offset="1269447">No testimony was introduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.701" offset="2067540">That principle is the very fundamental principle that the state cannot seize a person’s property without prior notice and hearing except in the most extra ordinary of situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.880" offset="5348310">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.161" offset="5365342">This is a case in which though the petitioner claims the denial of an opportunity for a hearing regarding the taking of his property there has in fact already been a hearing in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.999" offset="5444754">The petitioner has been heard and his contentions have been decided adversely to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.648" offset="5483311">One point I might make right off the bat, Your Honor, is that this case arose prior to the time that the decision had been rendered in the Fuentes case and the trial court's determination was made at a time prior to the decision in the Fuentes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.687" offset="5575471">In terms of the arguments in the briefs, I submit that there are two basic areas of dispute between the parties with respect to Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.873" offset="5640255">The first of those areas is as to the nature and extent of the hearing which has been had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.922" offset="5680483">In the second area of dispute is with respect to the rule of the Court which issues the writ of sequestration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.966" offset="5724578">Now, in the argument that’s preceded, there has been no discussion of that rule and I think that there should be a fuller development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.986" offset="5768673">But first, I’d like to turn to the question of the hearing that has been had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.444" offset="5802527">We submit that the petitioner comes before this Court and is not in a position to assert an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.128" offset="5849234">The Fuentes case was designed to prevent mistaken, unjustified or wrongful deprivations of property and that has not happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.077" offset="5901061">The petitioner has had a hearing albeit after the property was taken from his possession and he’s been heard in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.155" offset="5945365">Now, as to the nature of that hearing, this was a hearing that was brought on by the petitioner to set aside the writ of sequestration in an endeavor to obtain the return of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.015" offset="6008790">Now, the petitioner in essence claims that he was not able to go into the merits of the case at that time, but in fact, the petitioner was able to cause the court, the Louisiana Court to explore into the grounds for the issuance of what’s referred to as the auxiliary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.308" offset="6121953">There is a comment that the petitioner has referred to in his brief to the effect that at that hearing the merits may not be inquired into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.667" offset="6163435">In fact, we submit that any significant defense can be raised at that hearing and the cases that we have cited in our brief at pages 22 through 25 amply demonstrate that in cases in which a motion has been brought on to dissolve a writ of sequestration, the Court has inquired into issues that go to the merits and that is because the burden of proof at such a hearing has been placed on the party that caused the goods to be seized in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.670" offset="6339396">In short, the burden was on the respondent at that hearing to demonstrate that the property was properly seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.522" offset="6394880">Now, in addition at that hearing, after the property had been taken, there was a stipulation entered into by the parties to the effect that there was a valid vendor’s lien on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.661" offset="6479412">Now, in short, this is a situation in which the petitioner purchased property and then having gone into default after the property was seized, came into the Court and admitted that there was a valid vendor’s lien on that property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.796" offset="11319902">We have seen the petitioner in his reply brief endeavor to distinguish the cases on the basis that there is a difference between judicial sequestration and these cases only apply to judicial sequestration and some other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.562" offset="11395030">The claim is that in cases involving judicial sequestration, there is discretion in cases involving ordinary garden variety sequestration, there is no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.511" offset="11454798">We submit that attention to prior law under which these cases was decided indicates that there is one kind of sequestration and that is the judicial sequestration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.545" offset="11506939">We have set forth the definition of sequestration on page 30 of our brief and that shows that sequestration applies to a mandate of the Court, to the sheriff to take property without regard whether it’s made at the request of one of the parties or both of the parties, so, those cases we submit are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.491" offset="11614668">One further point that I think deserve to be made in the context of this case and that is the unusual feature of the civil law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.218" offset="11649672">Here, the vendor’s lien as in Louisiana Supreme Court has set forth in its opinion is thought to be an important creditor’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.241" offset="11689691">At the same time, it’s a right that can easily be defeated by the debtor in the event that the debtor transfers the property, the vendor losses the rights as against the property and so that it was for this reason that Louisiana Supreme Court, I believe, took the position that this was an important right that needed to be safeguarded and that there were circumstances in which it could be shown that there was an immediate need for action on the part of the creditor and that it would be appropriate for the government to lend its power to the taking of that action.</text>
