            <text syncTime="23.077" offset="169064">The case before you is a case involving a state court's jurisdiction to enjoin the violation of a no-strike promise by a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.282" offset="201874">The petitioner in this case is a general contractor and for purposes of clarity and keeping the party straight, I'll refer it to the William E. Arnold Company petitioner in this case as Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.436" offset="250462">The Company and the union had an agreement, which provided that there would be no strikes over a jurisdictional dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.417" offset="282436">The general contractor, the Company’s subcontractor who had a contract with another union pursuant to that agreement assigned certain work to this other union.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.887" offset="336248">The respondents here, the union, then struck in violation of the no-strike clause, which also provided that the grievance arbitration procedure of the National Joint Board would obtain in any disputes over jurisdictional dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.226" offset="405629">The company then filed an action in the state court for a temporary restraining order, which was granted after a notice to the union’s attorney and after the preemption doctrines had been argued before the state judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.855" offset="472189">A temporary restraining order was issued enjoining the union from further breach of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.374" offset="502282">The union then filed a suggestion for writ of prohibition in the First District Court of Appeal and state --</text>

            <label>Mr. John Paul Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="115.589" offset="539063">Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.421" offset="546482">It was not denominated as such in the pleadings, but it was in 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.304" offset="565917">The suggestion for writ of prohibition was filed in the First District on the basis that the Garmon doctrine as it had been enunciated by the Supreme Court of Florida in both the Sheet Metal and the Florida Heat and Power cases preempted the state court from taking jurisdiction in any labor dispute regardless of whether or not it was a contract violation, if the conduct involved was either arguably protected or arguably prohibited under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.640" offset="707291">The District Court rejected this argument, affirmed the jurisdiction of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.330" offset="738116">The union then filed -- filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of Florida, which was granted and the Florida Supreme Court reversed the District Court in a five to two decision, relying on its previous holdings in the Scherer and Sons case and in Florida Heat and Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.683" offset="823484">In both of those cases, the Florida Supreme Court had enunciated this Court’s doctrine of Garmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.282" offset="857861">We filed a -- the Company filed a petition for rehearing which was denied and we are here today on writ of certiorari to the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.803" offset="911987">Our petition for writ of certiorari was filed because as we contend in our brief and in the petition for writ of certiorari, the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida applies in the face of Smith v. Evening News and Lincoln Mills and Dowd Box.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.626" offset="983249">We submit that the simple question in this case is whether or not a state court is preempted from enjoining the breach of a no-strike promise in a collective bargaining agreement simply because the conduct which is involved in the breach is also an arguable or admitted unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.669" offset="1067468">In this case, we concede that the conduct of the union in striking over jurisdictional dispute was a violation of Section 8 (b) (4) (D) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.704" offset="1115533">So it was concededly an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.681" offset="1127445">We submit that the simple question can be answered by reviewing this Court’s holding in Smith v. Evening News and Carey v. Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.602" offset="1167151">We submit that if the state court has jurisdiction to entertain an action for breach of a collective bargaining agreement for damages or to compel arbitration as was the case in Carey v. Westinghouse, which also involved a jurisdictional dispute or a representation question depending on how you look at the case, then all the more so, the state court should have jurisdiction to enjoin the breach of a no-strike clause because this promotes the free flow of commerce, which is so basic in the purposes of the Act and it merely reduces an industrial strife by requiring the party who committed the breach to be bound by the promise they made in that agreement and to settle this dispute in a peaceful manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.327" offset="1394103">We submit that the only distinction that can be had between the Smith case and the Carey case and the case before you is that this case involved an injunction to enjoin the further breach of a no-strike promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.582" offset="1459096">And we submit further that the Florida Supreme Court’s reliance on the Garmon doctrine is erroneous in that there is a major distinguishing factor between Garmon and the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.658" offset="1511340">In Garmon, we were not concerned with a contractual relationship between the parties and in both of the cases relied upon by the Supreme Court of Florida, the Scherer and Sons case, and the Florida Heat and Power, we admit that the result was right but the reasoning was wrong because a reason that any activity arguably prohibited or protected is preempted with -- in a broad spectrum and not taking into account the fact that there maybe a contractual relationship between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.392" offset="1650312">Now, in neither of those cases Scherer and Sons nor in Florida Heat and Power was there a contractual relationship between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.462" offset="1690645">It did not involve a contract breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.768" offset="1699840">It involved activity which should have gone to the National Labor Relations Board because it was activity prohibited under Section 8 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.066" offset="1741009">We submit therefore that under the prevailing labor law, the state courts are not preempted in circumstances such as the instant case and that the Supreme Court of Florida should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.622" offset="1791269">We turn next to what we believe is the larger question in this case and that is the role of state court in the adjudication of disputes over breaches of collective bargaining agreements and the uniformity of National Labor Policy in both among the states and the relief that’s available for breaches of no-strike clauses or other contractual promises as between the state and the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.796" offset="1899938">We respectfully submit that this court’s opinion in this case can lay down guidelines for the state courts to be guided in their jurisdiction as to the adjudication of breaches of collective bargaining agreements and that this will go a long way in achieving uniformity of the result between both state and federal forums.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.105" offset="2009130">Mr. Jones, is that really before us?</text>
            <text syncTime="487.073" offset="2025012">My understanding is that the Supreme Court of Florida issued a writ of prohibition saying that whatever standards might apply to the Florida state courts in enforcing a 301 action if they had jurisdiction, they were simply preempted by the National Act and they didn’t pass and the District Court of Appeal didn’t pass on what standards would guide them if they had the right to entertain this suit?</text>

            <label>Mr. John Paul Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="512.090" offset="2125113">Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what we would submit is that this question so far as we can tell is one for the first time for this Court to decide as far as the jurisdiction of the state court to enjoin the breach of a no-strike promise by way of injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.721" offset="2191673">And as was pointed out in the footnote in Dowd Box that question was not before the court whether or not Norris-La Guardia applied to the state so as to preclude their issuance of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.587" offset="2243082">I believe that question was answered in Mr. Justice Brennan’s opinion in Boys Markets where in that opinion, you adopted the reasoning of Justice Traynor in the McCarroll case that in that regard, Norris-La Guardia, although Congress could have precluded the states from jurisdiction to issue injunctions, they did not do so, that Norris-La Guardia applies only to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.031" offset="2352901">Now, we submit that the question is before the Court in terms that we’re here to decide whether or not a state court has jurisdiction to enjoin the breach of a collective bargaining agreement and in that context, then the opinion in this Court will decide for the first time, “Do state courts have jurisdiction to enjoin a no-strike promise by injunction?”</text>
            <text syncTime="596.210" offset="2461571">And we submit that they do, that it would be consistent with the - this Court’s prior holdings, it would be consistent with the objective of the National Labor Relations Act to achieve a uniform policy and to promote industrial peace rather than industrial strife.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.832" offset="2544118">We -- I think that the parties here agree, both the respondent and the amicus the National Chamber that there should be a uniform policy throughout the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.735" offset="2775667">Under Lincoln Mills, they must, yes sir and we submit that for clarity and for uniformity of National Labor Policy that that’s what this decision should mean that state courts are bound by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.155" offset="2841391">The law is unclear at this point because the question was left open in Boys Markets opinion as Mr. Justice Brennan, you are well aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.082" offset="2881097">But we would submit that under Boys Markets, it answered the question for whether or not federal courts could issue an injunction in a labor dispute, not withstanding Norris-La Guardia restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.347" offset="2950165">We submit though that Boys Markets has left open certain questions and placed certain restrictions upon the parties in their free collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.479" offset="2994678">We submit that the holding in this case should be that a modified Boys Markets' holding would apply to both state and federal courts in their entertaining any suit to enjoin the breach of a no-strike promise and that we submit further that no-strike promises are generally enforceable in either state or federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.453" offset="3106586">We would turn now to several of the items in Boys Markets, which we consider were left open and would like to advance argument to the Court on.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.666" offset="3155383">In Boys Markets, one of the conditions precedent, which Mr. Justice Brennan outlined in that opinion which was the adoption of course of the dissenting opinion in Sinclair, was that as a condition precedent, the subject matter of the dispute had to be subject to a final binding agreements and arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.798" offset="3255902">We submit that a no-strike promise in a collective bargaining agreement should be enforced in either state or federal court notwithstanding whether the underlying grievance is subject to a binding grievance and arbitration clause or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.562" offset="3326955">Now, to do otherwise, we submit, dictates the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, which goes against this Court’s decisions in American National Insurance Company in 1952 and then the HK Porter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.790" offset="3395918">The reason we say that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.685" offset="3407517">When the parties sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate, there are a lot of factors that play at that table when they meet and discuss the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.619" offset="3463210">The employer may well be willing to pay more in terms of wages and fringes to the members of the bargaining union.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.265" offset="3497796">If he gets in return therefore a specific exclusion from the arbitration clause of some management decision, for example in subcontracting, the matter that was involved in Steelworkers Trilogy and Warrior and Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.578" offset="3567073">Now, we submit that the party should be left free to negotiate their own terms of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.090" offset="3601136">In Warrior and Gulf, Mr. Justice Douglas recognized that the parties could have specifically excluded from arbitration that matter of whether or not they had the right unqualifiedly to subcontract the work and that it would not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.566" offset="3683056">We note that in the Gateway decision, Mr. Justice Powell noted that the parties could, if they chose, negotiate a broad grievance and arbitration clause and yet specifically by terms in the agreement negate any no-strike promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.900" offset="3752333">We submit that if the parties can do that, then albeit they can exclude a narrow area from arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.884" offset="3784307">And that to do so, and to still have the no-strike promise enforceable even though the subject matter of dispute maybe within that narrow confine that’s not subject to arbitration promotes the policies of the Act rather than to do them violence because the underlying purpose of the Act of course is to promote industrial peace and harmony and to reduce interruptions of work through strikes and work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.871" offset="3916278">The whole underlying purpose of the Taft-Hartley Amendment was to equalize the bargaining positions and the enforceability of collective bargaining agreements as between employers and unions because at that point, employers had little incentive to enter into collective bargaining agreements, if they could not have them enforced, and therefore, came the Section 301 jurisdiction which it seems clear takes into its sphere not only legal relief, but equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.535" offset="4066847">The legislative history of that seems somewhat clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.297" offset="4085969">We submit that the rule as to enforcement of no-strike promises should follow along the lines of a doctrine enunciated by Mr. Justice Douglas in Warrior and Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.846" offset="4132153">And in that case, the arguably arbitrable doctrine was established that anything that was arguably arbitrable would be deemed to be subject to the arbitration clause of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.458" offset="4186593">We submit that no-strike promises should be arguably enjoinable and that if the union promises for the duration of the contract not to strike --</text>

            <text syncTime="1267.311" offset="5146018">We submit that if that is the holding, then we are placing restrictions on the employer that are not contemplated nor desired by the Act which promotes and encourages free collective bargaining between the parties and leaves the parties at the door of the bargaining realm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.106" offset="5213205">And that depends then on the relative strength of the parties and the skill of the negotiators and how much each party is willing to pay to get an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.607" offset="5259180">We submit that there are several areas that are left open in Boys Markets, several loopholes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.596" offset="5283109">For instance, if the union wants to say we’re going to strike but we don’t -- we’re not going to tell you what we’re striking about if they're dissatisfied with their union representation, Collyer can strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.672" offset="5327412">Under Boys Markets that would not be subject to the grievance arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.672" offset="5351445">We submit that the instant case presents a perfect opportunity of demonstrating what will happen unless there's uniformity of decision among the states and that the thrust of the Florida Supreme Court’s decision is that the employer can sit and negotiate the terms of a bargaining agreement, extract a promise from the union through give and take process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.555" offset="5467011">And yet if that process is not enforceable in a state court, then for all intents and purposes, the employer has been undermined in his bargaining attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.627" offset="5519256">And we would point out too that unless the -- unless the rule is the same as to state and federal courts that one, if state courts have broader jurisdiction to grant greater relief from the federal courts, we’ll get into a situation of pre Boys Markets where its removed under the F code because if they can narrow their relief, they’re removed from the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.022" offset="5628865">And if this is the case or if the state courts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin breaches of no-strike promises, then we are going to add greatly to the workload of the federal court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.518" offset="5674841">And in that regard, I would point out that in our jurisdiction in Jacksonville, we have 20 general jurisdiction state courts that are available to apply for a temporary restraining order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.749" offset="6599784">I am in complete agreement with Mr. Jones as to we all would like to have uniformity in the Federal Labor Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.025" offset="6632803">The problem that this case presents is that you have two relatively well gone over doctrines in the Federal Labor Law that are presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.547" offset="6690900">The first is the doctrine of federal preemption over unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.634" offset="6723291">The Garmon doctrine, Garner, Weber decisions saying that if a case presents a dispute that is arguably an unfair labor practice or a protected activity under the Act that the Federal Government has preempted the area and that state courts should defer to the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.030" offset="6832901">Then in this particular case, you also have the question of the Norris-La Guardia Act and the prohibition on federal courts of issuing injunctions in labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.525" offset="6894864">The Florida Supreme Court held essentially that the fact that a contract is involved does not remove the prohibitions of preemption that the Federal Government has placed upon the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.226" offset="6973649">That this area of the law, the injunction in a labor law dispute is sufficiently of national concern and national interest that the state courts should defer at least initial jurisdiction to the National Labor Relations Board when injunctive relief is what is requested and when it is concededly an unfair labor practice involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.535" offset="9454864">And that they decided that in that situation where there's no binding arbitration clause at least the way I read it, that the state court should not utilize its jurisdiction, it should defer jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.033" offset="9560921">And again to repeat, it seems to me that the best way to ensure national uniformity in our federal labor law and relations and especially in the area of unfair labor practices and injunctive relief is to allow the state courts to defer to the federal courts or the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.130" offset="9681293">Congress has set out what the unfair labor practices are.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.798" offset="9879928">Now, I don’t see any sense at all in having one layer of law, one pathway of law being the federal law saying only under these circumstances can injunctive relief be granted in the federal court, but under any all circumstances, they can be granted in the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2519.985" offset="10156722">What I am saying is that to allow state courts, as this one did, to defer to the federal jurisdiction would be better than allowing 50 states to go in 50 different ways on federal injunction labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.733" offset="10243657">I don’t know -- on the face of it, your contractual question; there is a conflict between the Florida Supreme Court’s decision and the decision in Smith v. Evening News.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.630" offset="10291304">But to say that it is such a conflict that we're going to just throw out to all the 50 states the question of federal injunctive relief and let them decide at it as they may, I think that the latter is more important and that the contractual question should yield to the federal preemption doctrine in this situation.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Paul Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="2588.622" offset="10431216">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, just one or two closing points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.965" offset="10456607">My adversary has pointed out that in regard to the National Labor Relations Board that they could well take cognizance of the matter and grant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.456" offset="10502583">We would point out; one, they do not have the power to issue cease and desist orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.087" offset="10517107">They must be enforced through a circuit court if it’s an order of the board or also under Section 10 (k), they are required by statute to defer to a voluntary method if it’s outlined in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.329" offset="10574054">We would point out as Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out in Lockridge dissent that the machinery of the Board is one of the slowest grinding processes that one could experience and someone would be out of business by the time they invoke those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.571" offset="10639047">The NLRB has held in the VMC Brooklyn case, the Collyer case, and the Laborers case that they will defer to an arbitration process even when there may be a specific violation of an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.248" offset="10709786">We would point out also that in Carey, there were two unions involved and that it wasn’t clear of whether both of them were subject to the arbitration clause, but arbitration was ordered by the holding in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.824" offset="10764016">We submit that the question as to Norris-La Guardia and the application of the states was answered in the Boys Markets opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan adopted Justice Traynor’s reasoning in the McCarroll case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.444" offset="10818560">We would submit that by virtue of that, that question has been answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.602" offset="10835174">The states courts do then have jurisdiction to issue injunctions in labor disputes in contractual matters when you apply the reasoning of Smith v. Evening News.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.427" offset="10886478">And we would submit that the best effectuation of national labor policy, of freedom of collective bargaining, of the free flow of commerce and of deferral to the parties choice of the terms of that collective bargaining agreement that all of these things are best served by permitting the states to enjoin breaches of no-strike promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.081" offset="10989087">And that this will go a long way toward achieving uniformity among the states and between the state and federal systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.467" offset="11022629">That in -- as was pointed out in Boys Market, damage action may lie for the breach of a no-strike promise, but a damage action is hardly compensation for the irreparable harm that occurs to an employer when a strike occurs and that the injunction is so important device in the enforcement of no-strike promises, that it should not be denied that in the maxim of “Justice delayed is justice denied” has no truer meaning than in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.747" offset="11143732">When a strike occurs, irreparable damages begin to run and the employer is left with no forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.312" offset="11169959">He cannot go to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.596" offset="11175184">If he goes to the federal court, it’s a longer way or if he is required to go to the National Labor Relations Board which really can’t grant him no immediate relief anyway, then he is left without any remedy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.708" offset="11231608">And even under the injunction procedures of the National Labor Relations Board in 8 (b) (4) (B) or 8 (b) (4) (D) situations, where under the statute, the Board is required to give them priority treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.397" offset="11282286">Our practical experience has been that if you can get to the U.S. District Court within ten days, it’s a miracle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.604" offset="11315200">And from that regard then we submit that the National Labor Relations Board is no forum to adjudicate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.841" offset="11344144">They do not have the power to do so and they do not have machinery and they’ve said themselves that they will defer to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.165" offset="11377371">We submit therefore that the basic question here that we face in determining the matter of whether or not state court should be allowed to enjoin no-strike promises is how can the purposes of the Act be frustrated or the employees rights be infringed if they are required to do what they promised to do in a collective bargaining agreement?</text>
