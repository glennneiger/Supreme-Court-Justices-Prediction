            <label>Mr. Leo J. Conway</label>
            <text syncTime="29.617" offset="195187">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.516" offset="210860">We seek a review of the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which affirmed the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, issuing a writ of habeas corpus effecting respondent’s release from the custody of the Ohio authorities pursuant to his having been convicted of the crime of murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.898" offset="344294">The basis for the finding that even though the arresting officers had reasonable grounds to believe that the evidence seized was and had in fact have been used in the commission of the crime itself, that they had had an ample opportunity to procure a warrant for the seizure of this automobile and, therefore, that the seizure of the automobile was per se unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.817" offset="492042">I should like, if I may, to describe the conditions leading up to the seizure of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.626" offset="531226">On July 19, 1967, a man with the name of Paul Radcliffe who was a Certified Public Accountant was brutally murdered.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.035" offset="584934">Now, prior to his murder, he had been requested over a telephone to come to the City of Delaware, Ohio to seek or to give an interview pursuant to his having been or to his future employment as a CPA for this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.619" offset="675213">At that same time, this anonymous caller who described himself as being officer of the IBEX (ph) Company asked Mr. Radcliffe if he would stop on the way in at a factory building which had been abandoned to look over the factory building to determine whether the company might use it in future expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.215" offset="773642">As he got out of his automobile at approximately quarter to nine on the morning of July 16 -- July 19, he was greeted by three blasts from a shotgun which immediately took his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.830" offset="840098">His body then was dragged over an embankment, his car was shoved over an embankment and later on because of the fortunate, and inadvertent really, inspection of the river by a game warden, the car was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.693" offset="931527">The police were informed and after the police had been informed, they went out and found the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.122" offset="965277">Now, immediately of course an investigation took place and a neighbor across the street had heard three shots, but had thought nothing about it because in this area, on numerous occasions the kids were hunting, shooting off guns, and it was rather common.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.412" offset="1054407">But shortly afterwards, she heard the screech of tires and gravel being thrown up in the fenders or underneath the fenders of the car, she went to the front door and, as she did, she observed a gold automobile which she describes as a 1967 or 1968 Oldsmobile accelerating towards Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.801" offset="1159941">Now, in the investigation that followed, the Delaware County authority discovered that Arthur Ben Lewis, the respondent herein, owned such an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.624" offset="1211246">They also learned that, in the process of their investigation, that he had looked at this building himself and was thoroughly familiar with it because he thought he might procure this building for the purpose setting up a club.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.877" offset="1284284">They also knew that he went by this building everyday of his summer occupancy practically because he had two swimming pools in the near vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.290" offset="1341858">They then found out that he had also been attempting to sell his -- one of his business, of which he had many, to some people who had employed Radcliffe as an auditor to inspect the books of the company to determine whether in fact the company was sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.786" offset="1431928">A telephone call made to these people a half hour after the murder took place, after the shots have been fired which we assume was the time that the murder took place, the lady whose husband was buying the business received a call again from an individual saying that he was Paul Radcliffe, that he had examined the books of the company, that he was going out of town for a few days, and that the company was very sound and recommended that the purchase go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.764" offset="1595768">Now, based upon all of this knowledge on the part of the officers, a search warrant -- an arrest warrant was procured for his arrest on October 20, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.867" offset="1676225">It goes without saying that at the time, although had this -- they known that they were going to arrest him on this particular day that it might have been said that they could’ve gotten a search warrant, but for the automobile, which they knew by that time it had been used or they had every reason to believe it’d been used in pushing his car over the embankment and which had been damaged on the front end because there were paint -- yellow or gold paint flakes on the back of the car that had been pushed over the embankment.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.704" offset="3871556">And of course, that’s our point, Mr. Justice Marshall, that the police having had the parking ticket placed them in the same position as to take the car as it would had they put an officer on the car to guard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.185" offset="3949505">As an example, I think that the Court of Appeals and the District Court in this case based their entire decision on the Coolidge case that was decided by this Court and, which they indicated was on all force with Coolidge.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.515" offset="4050860">But as a matter of fact, there were no similarity between the facts in this case and Coolidge except that they indicated that they knew that they wanted -- the officers in this case wanted the car prior to the time the arrest was made, the same as that in Coolidge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.568" offset="4131004">But the difference was in Coolidge and in this case is, as in Coolidge the officers knew where the car was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.995" offset="4160679">They knew its description and all they had to do, as the Court indicated, was to get a valid search warrant to go get the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.821" offset="4200072">In our case, the officers at the time that they made the arrest did not know where the car was and the only way that they could have gotten a search warrant and seized the car prior thereto would’ve perhaps warranted their entire investigation and this Court definitely has indicated that that was not necessary in the Harper case, in Harper v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.223" offset="4325669">The fact of the matter is that at the time that -- the first time that the police knew where the car was, was right when the arrest took place or immediately thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.027" offset="4372898">Again, stressing the Ohio law, the -- in Ohio, there’s no search warrant provided for an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.811" offset="4415948">A search warrant may only be issued for a home or place and an automobile, I think, would fit under the term “effects” as used in the constitution and if they want an effect, they want to seize or search an effect they must specificity indicate where that effect is before they can get a search warrant to search for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.439" offset="4522527">And as a matter of fact, since this is not a part of the record, but that’s the way it’s done today even though the police have searched, have seized an automobile in Columbus, Ohio and it's in the police -- they get the search warrant actually to search it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.660" offset="4587416">And the place, of course, is of -- the location is police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.068" offset="4609045">So they, in effect, are serving a search warrant upon themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.228" offset="4629629">The other aspect of course of Coolidge that the court indicated or disagreed with, insofar as our argument was concerned, that there was no exigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.929" offset="4680516">And of course, that gets us back to the point that anybody in the family could’ve removed the automobile and hence deprived the state of the use of that automobile as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.031" offset="4736836">Now, we attempted in the court below to indicate or to base this search upon a valid arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.594" offset="4787096">There isn’t any question in this case as to the validity of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.664" offset="4811442">The District Judge, as a matter of fact, made a footnote indicating that the arrest warrant was not good in that it did not follow the federal requirements for arrest warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.236" offset="4865672">But certainly, in the State of Ohio, that arrest warrant was perfectly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.431" offset="4886465">In the State of Ohio, although the arresting officer must do over the -- when -- making the affidavit for the search warrant as to indicate that A, B killed C, D and that he has reasonable grounds to believe that he did and that’s exactly what the search warrant provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.062" offset="4965042">It is not required, under Ohio law, that he indicate how and where and who said and what have you like, as a matter of fact, it’s required him a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.329" offset="5010077">Now, when the search -- at the time that Mr. Lewis, having been arrested, pulled the parking ticket out of his pocket and said “this is the parking ticket to my car,” the police certainly had a right, in our opinion, to seize that parking ticket because they knew it was a parking ticket for the vehicle that they wanted as an instrumentality or as evidence in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.361" offset="5150198">And, therefore, they having had taken this parking ticket validly, they had to right, a continuing right to exercise jurisdiction over the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.324" offset="5205995">Incidentally, this was -- this automobile was parked on a private parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.716" offset="5231595">And there was no reason that once that the police knew where the automobile was that they could’ve gone next door and taken some paint off of the automobile in itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.807" offset="5391987">They would’ve been seizing something in plain view, it was our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.793" offset="5411944">Now, the court below disagreed with that theory because they said that they had to go down a couple of layers in order to do the real comparison, which I agree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.785" offset="5459905">I mean, they did have to go below the seeable part of the paint on the car in order to make the chemical analysis to determine whether or not the same paint or the same type of paint was -- one comparable to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.643" offset="5539318">But, nevertheless, I believe that assuming for the sake or argument that they admire the car, they might have actually been liable in the tort action for the scratching of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.065" offset="5600967">But that did not, in any way, prevent them from taking what they believe to be a valid evidence to use in the murder itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.368" offset="5650181">When the motion to suppress was filed in this case in the trial court, the only precedent that the trial court had at that time was a recent precedent was, of course, Cooper and Preston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.230" offset="5741714">And the Preston case, certainly, was very dissimilar to the case in this -- in our situation for the simple reason that this Court held in Preston that the reason for which the car was seized had nothing whatsoever to do with the crime for which the defendant had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.406" offset="5834397">But certainly in this case, there was every reason to believe that there was evidence of the crime itself and the police wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.371" offset="5870237">Now, the district -- the trial judge relied strictly on Cooper in making its determination on a motion to suppress that the car was validly seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.490" offset="5930736">The court said, in Cooper, the Supreme Court observed that the car in that case was seized and impounded because of and in connection with the crime for which Cooper was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.897" offset="5984340">In this case, the car was seized, impounded and searched because of the crime for which the defendant was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.991" offset="6016731">And then, the court went on to say that it found that -- and incidentally the court in that case did hold that they believe that the seizure of the parking ticket was, in effect, constructive seizure of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.078" offset="6077022">But the court said further that this, in its opinion, rendered the seizure to have been in all respects reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.958" offset="6128536">The Supreme Court of Ohio likewise found the search to be reasonable and, I believe by the time it got to the Supreme Court of Ohio, this Court had decided Chambers v. Maroney which gave impetus, I believe, to the decision in Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.222" offset="6209620">Therefore, it was held that if these officers had a right to take that car initially as evidence in the crime on the parking lot that they had a right therefore to take it to the police impounding area and do such search as was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.526" offset="6306900">Now, at no time did they ever enter the inside of the car for any evidence that was subsequently disposed of in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.084" offset="6521104">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.047" offset="6536986">The issue in this case is whether the Fourth Amendment was violated by the warrantless seizure of respondent’s car and the removal of a small paint sample from it which was subsequently introduced and evidenced against him at his murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.291" offset="6593933">Now, we have briefed this case and are arguing this case on the premise that there was indeed opportunity for the police to get a warrant and that there was no emergency or other justification for they’re not doing it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.074" offset="6653074">We’re advancing the contention that they were not required to get a warrant to do what they did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.526" offset="6678883">Now, we’re dealing here as in almost every case in which the issue focuses on the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.759" offset="6699781">With police action, that can’t be deemed unreasonable in the normal sense of the word, since if it were unreasonable in that sense, no warrant could issue to authorize the action that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.381" offset="6746279">So, was it unreasonable here for the Ohio law enforcement officers knowing the facts that my colleague has just recited to you to believe that respondent’s automobile should be seized and examined for evidence that they had every expectation of finding and it would be highly probative at his anticipated murder trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.889" offset="6820258">Obviously not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.691" offset="6827468">Similarly, was it unreasonable of them to remove a paint sample from respondent’s car to compare it with the foreign paint found on the car of the deceased?</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.743" offset="6867696">Surely, a failure to pursue such a line of inquiry would’ve been not just unreasonable, but grounds for dismissal for gross incompetence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.425" offset="6902491">So why, since respondent was constitutionally protected only from an unreasonable search or seizure, are we here today?</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.162" offset="6933420">It’s because this Court has determined that, in many circumstances, the kind of reasonableness that I’ve been talking about is not enough. But there’s an overriding policy favoring antecedent judicial determinations of reasonableness and the issuance of warrants authorizing searches and seizures before certain kinds of police intrusions into the affairs of the citizen will be countenanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.382" offset="7030282">Now, in many cases, this policy has been expressed in terms of a per se rule of presumptive unreasonableness of warrantless seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.591" offset="7059122">Accompanied, however, by a collection of exceptions, each of which has its own rational, but which, taken together, leave a substantial area of uncertainty today 185 years after the adoption of the Fourth Amendment about when a warrant is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.078" offset="7129025">We suggest that there is a sound underlying rational that runs through the Court’s efforts in this area that a meaningful understanding of the unifying principles is beclouded by thinking in terms of a pro se -- per se warrant requirement with a -- what I might call a procrustean hotel of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.047" offset="7216901">This approach tends to lead the Court into the inquiry whether there was a reasonable opportunity to get a warrant rather than whether the search should be considered reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.842" offset="7252114">Although as the Court stated in Cooper against California, the latter is the constitutionally relevant standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.532" offset="7282834">Now, to identify this unifying rational one must ask, why would the court ever call a concededly reasonable search unreasonable because of the absence of a warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.048" offset="7328914">It can only be because there are some circumstances in which it is simply not tolerable for the police to act without a prior evaluation of their reasons by a neutral and detached magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.309" offset="7373949">So, we urge the Court today to adopt the functional analysis of the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.107" offset="7397146">The per se rule which says that the search is unreasonable without a warrant makes sense when we’re talking about searches of houses, as was eloquently stated in the Johnson and the McDonald cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.783" offset="7451899">It makes sense when we’re talking about intercepting conversations or intercepting mail where substantial privacy expectations are being defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.018" offset="7488784">This point was emphasized in Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.757" offset="7503726">Does it make sense, however, in the case of the automobile?</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.197" offset="7525564">Now, I suggest that it is more than just a freakish coincidence that this Court has never, insofar as I’m aware, struck down a warrantless probable cause search of an automobile with the sole exception of the Coolidge case and in Coolidge, there was critical extra ingredient, the intrusion on to Mr. Coolidge’s private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.429" offset="7614485">Now, the reason for this goes back to the real values that underlie the Fourth Amendment protections which were stated by Justice Brennan in Warden against Hayden, page 304 of 387 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.713" offset="7663595">He said “the premise that property interest control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.632" offset="7695256">We have recognized that the principle object of the Fourth Amendment is the protection of privacy rather than property and have increasingly discarded fictional and procedural barriers rested on property considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.926" offset="7752411">Accordingly, we submit that whether a search or seizure without a warrant should be held per se unreasonable depends on a determination of whether the privacy interest at stake is of such magnitude that the interposition of a neutral and detached magistrate should be required to make the probable cause determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.507" offset="7842795">Now, in approaching this analysis, I think the principal distinction that we would draw is the distinction between searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.848" offset="7888144">While like the admiral in HMS Pinafore, I’m not sure that I’m prepared to say never, I find it hard to imagine a situation in which a seizure, as such, should require a warrant if it is otherwise reasonable as distinct from a search because when we’re talking about a seizure, we’re talking about an invasion of the individual’s property interest only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.159" offset="7985424">A search, on the other hand, does involve, almost by definition, some kind of intrusion into his privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.179" offset="8017502">In the area of searches, therefore, I think the Court ought to weigh what privacy interests are at stake?</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.297" offset="8053969">Are these privacy interest are such that in determining whether the search is reasonable under the first clause of the Fourth Amendment, the Court will impose the warrant requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.938" offset="8108513">Now, the per se approach, I think, leads to some --</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.727" offset="8267651">My suggestion is that while those property interests are protected by the Fourth Amendment, they are protected by the reasonableness requirement and they ought not -- they don’t need the additional protection of the per se warrant rule which this Court has spoken about, but has frequently declined to apply in cases where it clearly seemed improper to deem a search unreasonable because there was no warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2071.623" offset="8363259">I understand your privacy argument directed to distinguishing this case from Coolidge where in order to take the car in the Coolidge case, they had to invade at least the privacy of the man’s home and dwelling and garage and here, it was a private parking lot and no expectation of that kind of privacy?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="2096.596" offset="8463151">That is true, although I think our argument -- that consideration is a consideration which distinguishes Coolidge from this case in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.733" offset="8503693">In Coolidge they intruded onto his private property, and in Coolidge they went into the body of his car to remove dust and sweepings from the floor of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.996" offset="8556774">What I’m suggesting, however, is a general approach to this problem which has come up so many times and where it’s difficult to perceive a unifying threat of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.624" offset="8611213">And I’m suggesting that what early motivates the Court ordinarily is that they see in some instances the kind of intrusion into privacy as in Katz, which the Court is simply not prepared to allow the police to do just on the basis of their own reasons for doing so even if those reasons are subsequently found to have been sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.785" offset="8707866">Now, in the -- in our brief we discussed the White case which the Sixth Circuit decided some months after they decided Cardwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.488" offset="8750707">Now, in the White case, the defendant have been arrested for passing counterfeit currency and they located his car which presumably, if in fact the reasons that they had to believe that he had used it to transport counterfeit currency were valid would be subject to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.614" offset="8839210">They went into the glove compartment of his car and they found there other counterfeit currency which was introduced in evidence against him at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.291" offset="8877871">Now the Court of Appeals, instead of looking at what it was that the police were doing and looking at what the privacy interests of the citizen were that were at stake as they did not do in the Cardwell case either, the Court of Appeals says “well, he went in for some purpose other than looking for evidence of a crime so that it’s alright for him to do the very same act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.914" offset="8980376">Now, I would suggest that, for instance, in Cady against Dombrowski where a somewhat similar rational was utilized that had they known that the gun or believed reasonably that the gun was used in a murder, that should not detract from the right from which this Court recognize them to have to go into the car without a warrant in order to seize the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.259" offset="9081835">If it does, I think it inverts the -- what seems to me to make sense or be reasonable in the sense that the term was used in the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.394" offset="9138364">Now, I’d like to address a comment briefly to the Almeida-Sanchez case to Justice Powell’s concurring opinion in that case because there, there was a question of whether a search on less than probable cause might be deemed nevertheless reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.106" offset="9217149">And I think, there, the -- it was the absence of probable cause which made it necessary to seek a warrant as a means in effect of reinforcing the reasonableness in the normal ordinary sense of the word for the police to make this intrusion on citizens driving along the road near the boarder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.099" offset="9309100">Had there been probable cause, I don’t think the per se warrant requirement would’ve been necessary or properly applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.507" offset="9374824">Now, we also mentioned in our brief some of the historical factors that are in the background and I think these are some of the same factors that Justice Douglas discussed in his dissenting opinion in Matlock, although we read them to have a different impact on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.305" offset="9449953">Now, we recognize the Court is not bound strictly by the understanding of the framers in drafting the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.583" offset="9491122">In some sense, the Constitution is a living instrument and we’re not suggesting that it should be narrowly constraint to 18th Century circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.050" offset="9528947">However, we think that it is clear that the concern was with the kind of invasion privacy that’s detailed in going into a dwelling that the general warrant concern was with going into the man’s house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.219" offset="9589656">And we think that the statute of 1815, which was cited in the Carol case and which is one illustration of early congressional understanding of the restriction on searches and seizures is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.898" offset="9644304">This was a statute which permitted custom's search that’s not just at the border, but any place within the custom’s district and had made a distinction between going into a house and searching a vehicle or vessel or beast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.269" offset="9705848">In the latter case, not only did it provide that search could be made on mere suspicion and, as distinct from the warrant requirement for searching in a house, but it had a proviso which Chief Justice Taft did not quote in the Carol opinion but which we think is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.051" offset="9772931">It’s quoted at page 27 of our brief and it said “provided always that the necessity of a search warrant arising under this Act shall, in no case, be considered as applicable to any carriage, wagon, cart, sleigh, vessel, boat, or other vehicle of whatever form of construction employed as a medium of transportation or the packages on any animal or animals or carried by man or on foot.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.213" offset="9873554">And that statute was signed into law by the Father of the Fourth Amendment, James Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.470" offset="9894661">And, I think it sheds some significant light on the understanding of the framers with regard to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.544" offset="9930919">So, to sum up, we suggest that in this case the seizure of the car and the removal of a piece of paint from the car constituted seizures and not searches and that the Court should recognize, as we think sound analysis compels, that a seizure does not, ordinarily barring some exceptional circumstances not present here, have to require the antecedent justification of a warrant in order to be reasonable, but rather its reasonableness can be assessed on the basis of what the police officers knew, what justification they had for going and doing what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.119" offset="10081176">In this case, we submit that they had every justification for doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.381" offset="10098312">If there are no questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.650" offset="10103327">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce A. Campbell</label>
            <text syncTime="2517.132" offset="10145228">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.498" offset="10162782">As I read the briefs of the petitioner in this case and of the Solicitor General and as I listen to the oral arguments of my brothers Mr. Frey and Mr. Conway, I am struck repeatedly by the aptness of the observation of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his dissent in Rabinowitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.242" offset="10253688">And I paraphrase to some extent here that, “where one comes out on a case depends very much on where one goes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.094" offset="10293081">And that it makes all the difference in the world whether one approaches the Fourth Amendment as a safeguard against recurrent abuses or merely as a provision dealing with a formality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.745" offset="10359745">It seemed to me that both the petitioner and the amicus in this case seem to take as granted that it is somehow automatically desirable that, as many areas as possible to be excised from Fourth Amendment protection and that police action wherever possible be taken out from under the coverage of that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.837" offset="10464131">And they do that in this case without devoting in their briefs or in their oral argument a single word as to why there was, under the facts of this case, a specific burden upon law enforcement a specific risk to be taken by the procuring of a warrant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.943" offset="10564545">And they also do this it seems to me, without stopping to consider the potentiality for executive abuse that is inherent in the positions which they urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.699" offset="10615536">Respondent, of course, approaches this case from the perspective of the very fundamental nature of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.309" offset="10653989">I would like before I begin to clear up, I think, some factual difficulties that have arisen from oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.291" offset="10689933">Mr. Conway, I think, has supplied some details of the murder itself which are at least speculative in the record and I think that there are some other inaccuracies that should be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.320" offset="10746044">First of all, it is claimed that the witness at the -- near the murder scene who saw the departing automobile claimed it to have been a gold ‘67 or ‘68 Oldsmobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.070" offset="10804976">In fact, she said that it was tan or beige car that it was of a make similar to her own Corvette but she was not aware of what specific brand of car it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.134" offset="10861296">Secondly, with regard to the phone call that was received by the wife of the person who was purchasing the business, Mr. Smith, who had hired the decedent, Mr. Radcliffe, to examine the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.793" offset="10927961">The record of the case will disclose that the caller, whoever that caller may have been, did not specifically say “I have examined the books of Grahams Auto Parts,” which was the name of the business that the defendant was attempting to sell to Mr. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.152" offset="11001313">It merely said -- that witness at the trial merely claimed that the caller said “I have examined the books and they are in a one shape.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.902" offset="11052408">Now, it is also fact in the record that the accountant was the general accountant for Mr. Smith, not just the accountant for the specific purpose of this particular transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.023" offset="11104862">So, I think that the state has inferred more than it should from that telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.747" offset="11135687">And one final matter; it has been suggested that the person searching the car on the day it was seized did not intrude upon the interior of that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.824" offset="11188036">In fact, he did, he opened the trunk of that car and looked in and observed a nearly new tire and he testified about this at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.905" offset="11228369">Now, the reason that that has not been emphasized in this appeal or throughout the course of this case is that there was other testimony concerning the tires, whereas, the only testimony concerning the paint came as the result of the taking of the paint from the automobile at the time of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.971" offset="11312588">It seems to me that we have, here, essentially two distinct characterizations of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.792" offset="11339964">The State of Ohio says that this was a case in which almost all of the traditional exceptions to the warrant requirement were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.988" offset="11376744">They claim consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.720" offset="11383641">They claim that there was incidency to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.369" offset="11398269">They claim that there was urgency of circumstance that necessitated a warrantless seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.345" offset="11422093">The Solicitor General takes quite a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.880" offset="11432229">He says he explicitly denies that there were exigent circumstances here and he tacitly seems to concede that there was no consent and no incidency to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.248" offset="11489698">But he argues that one has less than a full-fledged Fourth Amendment interest in his automobile and that the scraping of the paint in this case was not a seizure as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.006" offset="11540793">With respect to probable cause, there seems also to be a disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.676" offset="11559497">The Solicitor General has urged unquestionably that there was probable cause, although he does not explain this at any point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.624" offset="11595233">The State of Ohio seems to be in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.481" offset="11606622">In its own conclusion, at page 35 of its brief it states that while the authorities in our case had information relating to the car prior to the seizure, there is no indication that such information amounted to probable cause to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.617" offset="11675167">I propose to examine in turn, first, the more traditional exceptions to the warrant requirement that are raised primarily by the state, specifically consent search incident and exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.680" offset="11747474">And then, move to what I perceive to be the more novel exception which the state indirectly and the Solicitor General more specifically has asked this Court to countenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.772" offset="11807869">With respect to the issue of consent in this case, I would first point out to the Court that that issue is, at best, clouded upon the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.337" offset="11854054">There are essentially two versions of what happened on October 10, 1967 which was the day when the defendant was asked to come to the Office of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.151" offset="11913404">He appeared, he was questioned throughout the day despite the fact that the officers already at that time had an arrest warrant for first-degree murder for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.703" offset="11967530">A tape recording was made of that interrogation session, and I’ll refer to that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.214" offset="11993652">The respondent says that, at that time, the -- that he attempted only to turnover the keys and the claim check of his automobile to his attorney, Mr. Scott and this is verified by his two attorneys, Mr. Tingly who’s the first attorney and Mr. Scott as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.820" offset="12091977">Mr. Tingly testified in a motion to suppress hearing prior to the trial, and Mr. Scott testified in the evidentiary hearing in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.587" offset="12131056">Now, the investigating officials here claim that what happened was that the defendant made a request that his car be kept for “safekeeping,” but Mr. -- Sergeant Lavery himself conceded that this request made to no one in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.692" offset="12219559">That may be found on page 58a of the Appendix and he seems that -- Sergeant Lavery seems also to be at least confused as to when exactly this occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.692" offset="12275566">At a pretrial motion to suppress, he thought that it was probably before the defendant’s counsel had arrived at the Office of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.244" offset="12317675">Subsequently, at the evidentiary hearing, he seemed to be sure that it was after counsel had arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.391" offset="12354351">Now, the District Court examined at some length, I think, all of the facts surrounding this alleged consent and determined that even if it took these facts in the light most favorable to the state, which it was not required to do even under that construction, there was not sufficient consent to allow the taking of the automobile here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.751" offset="12467722">The state courts did not find consent either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.192" offset="12485486">The trial court rested its decision on a search incident theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.767" offset="12507847">The Ohio Supreme Court went off on what could only be described as an instrumentality of the crime theory, interestingly enough, never even citing Warden versus Hayden which had been decided some two years prior to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.406" offset="12578377">The burden of proving consent here was clearly on the state, as this Court has said repeatedly and most recently in the Schneckloth decision and in the Matlock decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.501" offset="12626756">It seems to me that to imply a full waiver of Fourth Amendment constitutional rights from what, at most, coul be characterized as an expression of concern about one’s property would be the ultimate paradox.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.374" offset="12702198">If it is a desirable goal to foster citizen cooperation with investigation -- with law investigation, and Mr. Lewis in this case was most cooperative, it hardly seems to be in furtherance of that goal to allow sweeping interpretations to be made of a simple request of the nature of the warrant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.749" offset="12811703">Now, perhaps, one --</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.577" offset="12907102">And consent is raised in another way by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.930" offset="12928418">He proposes that though there may not have been enough consent here for a seizure of the automobile, there was somehow enough consent that the automobile could be taken into custody and then searched.</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.869" offset="13072196">I think in the case of the Solicitor General’s brief that it is something of an argument in passing, but he does raise the possibility that there may have been sufficient consent here to merit a taking into custody and then he argues from that that what followed was not really a search at all and that it was justified very much in the line that this Court justified Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.706" offset="13179611">I submit that this is pure sophistry, that consent to search is certainly no different than consent to take into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.138" offset="13233319">Now, with respect to the incidence to arrest, the petitioner here proposes a nexus between the arrest and car seizure based not upon the physical proximity of the defendant and his automobile, but rather upon his possession at the moment of arrest of a parking lot claim check for the car and perhaps the keys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.643" offset="13351288">I should point out that there is a dispute in the record as to whether Mr. Lewis had the keys at the time of the arrest or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.985" offset="13380650">Mr. Lewis says that he did. Other witnesses said only the claim check was apparently turned over and it may have been a parking lot where the keys were kept at the parking lot.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.122" offset="13449195">In effect, I think the petitioner is urging a Doctrine of Constructive Possession whereby what one has on his possession, if it is a part of or a means of access to, some other object, will allow the state then to seize that other object no matter where it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.307" offset="13545953">I believe this to be an absurd extension of the Search Incidency Doctrine and that it is founded upon no prior case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.016" offset="13584823">It seemed to me, as the District Court held, that incidency in this case must be judged upon (Inaudible) standards that Rabinowitz is probably the controlling case, but even in Rabinowitz the court held that -- held only that a tiny office in which the defendant was arrested and which was under his immediate and complete control could be searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.622" offset="13695269">The Preston case which, again, was decided before the facts of this case, this case occurred, involved an automobile on the street and, in that case, the Court said that once an accused is under arrest and in custody, then a search made at another place without a warrant is simply not incident to the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4093.353" offset="16450142">Petitioner has also claimed exigency of circumstance or urgency, here, necessitating the warrantless seizure of this automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.796" offset="16491938">He rests his claim, I think, on three assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.393" offset="16502282">First of all, that the investigators did not know where the car was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.060" offset="16524957">Second, that confederates may have absconded with the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.870" offset="16540212">And finally, that probable cause, if it existed at all, did not come into being until the moment of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.799" offset="16571977">I’d like to take each one of these claims in turn, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.390" offset="16586292">As to the whereabouts of the car, there is absolutely no indication in the record in this case that the state did not know at many times throughout this investigation where the car was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.298" offset="16645956">In fact, they had very specific knowledge about the car and had seen the car 78 days prior to October 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.446" offset="16678557">They went to the defendant’s place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.462" offset="16690573">They asked him where his car was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.215" offset="16697574">It was in the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.281" offset="16701858">He pointed it to them -- pointed it out to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.194" offset="16713561">They had an opportunity to note its color and did, in fact, at that moment, begin to consider him as a suspect because the color of the car matched the one that they already were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.678" offset="16771448">Now, it seems to me that any doubt that the Court might have about the specificity of the information which the state had by the time of October 10 concerning the defendant, his car, his home, his general whereabouts, his businesses, his financial condition can easily be dispelled by reading in the Bill of Exceptions, the transcription of the interrogation session which took place on October 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.955" offset="16908539">You will remember that I pointed out to the Court that a tape recording was made unknown to the defendant of that interrogation session.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.209" offset="16945633">In the trial of the case, the state attempted to, first, introduce this transcript into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.736" offset="16983667">This was objected to and the objection was sustained, but then, the trial judge allowed one of the states’ witnesses, Mr. Mann, to read verbatim into the record the record of that transcription of the interrogation session and that may be found on page 485 to 568 of the Bill of Exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.326" offset="17074051">Throughout that interrogation session, it is clear that they had very specific knowledge about where Mr. Lewis had been, who he had talked to, where his car was, where his home was.</text>

            <text syncTime="4281.758" offset="17203827">There is talk in the record that I just told you about as to where -- there is a dialogue between the investigator and Mr. Lewis about his home, but I do not believe it says where he lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.498" offset="17270700">As in the side, I would point out to the Court that the record of that interrogation is instructive in its own right of why, as the Court has said from time to time, zealous officers engaged in the enterprise of ferreting out crime should not be allowed to make ad hoc judgments about probable cause matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.668" offset="17367458">That was a brutal interrogation session, not in a physical sense but in a mental sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.058" offset="17400999">During the course of that interrogation, the state repeatedly tried to get the defendant to take a lie detector test although, at the very first instance, the defendant said he would not even consider it without talking to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.971" offset="17456588">And in another place in the record of that interrogation, the interrogator attempts to help Mr. Lewis fabricate a non-premeditative version of the facts of this killing in order that he might not have to charge him with first-degree murder, not telling him that a first-degree murder warrant was already in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.618" offset="17555226">Now, with respect to the assumption that there was a confederate in this crime, I should point out that there is no testimony in the record that shows that there ever was an accomplice, that the state ever believed that there was an accomplice, that the defendant’s family was in any way in league with the defendant or would have removed the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.706" offset="17643624">And as to Mr. Scott, the attorney, it seems to me that once Mr. Scott turned over the claim check and perhaps the keys to the police that, at that point in time, he indicated that he was not going to run a footrace with the investigators down to the car and he indicated that he was not going to take the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.908" offset="17724395">They had no reason to believe that that car would be taken out of the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.403" offset="17746338">Now, the final assumption, I think, is -- deals with the question of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.274" offset="17777894">Now, the state claims here that there may not have been probable cause up to October 10 to get a search warrant for the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.748" offset="17815719">But then, it seems to claim that somehow during the day something developed that made the probable cause argument and made the seizure possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.201" offset="17873502">But the only fact that they’ve suggested that has emerged during that interrogation on October 10 was the fact that the defendant gave a slightly different version of why he had had his car repaired than he did when he had it repaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.273" offset="17945809">Now, there is no showing by the petitioner why this tiny fact, added to the others that the police had, somehow became the sine qua non of probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="4596.505" offset="18462720">Turning, if I may, to the question raised by the amicus in this case, it would seem to argue to this Court that somehow an individual’s privacy interest in his automobile, at least when it’s not parked at home, is not of sufficient intensity to necessitate full invocation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.864" offset="18560209">I would, first, examine the assumption that he makes that individuals do not expect in an automobile the same kind of security interest that they do in other objects of their life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.265" offset="18629799">Certainly, there is no basis in the Fourth Amendment to differentiate between an automobile and other effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.654" offset="18667416">The Solicitor General cites no empirical data suggesting that Americans do not expect a privacy interest in their automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.739" offset="18707749">And, the only case law which he cites is a 52-year-old Michigan case dealing with a car that was found upon fairgrounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.736" offset="18747664">I submit that the assumption that, in 1974, we do not expect the same privacy interest with respect to our automobiles that we do with respect to other accouterments of our life is simply unfounded.</text>

            <text syncTime="4890.414" offset="19638439">I think this is precisely the approach that the Court has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.418" offset="19658397">In Terry, the Court pointed to the fact that the inestimable right of personal security belongs as much to the citizens on the street as to the homeowner closeted in his study to dispose of his secret affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.766" offset="19719837">I think that the Katz case is yet another example where this Court has dealt not with a proprietary interest, but in an interest in one’s sphere of existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.025" offset="19776888">Here, Lewis did seek privacy in his automobile, as evidenced by the fact that he put his car into a commercial parking lot to make it safe from the vulnerability of public areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="4962.798" offset="19927980">He suggests that since we have declared automobiles to be second class effects under the Fourth Amendment, that what we ought to do is give them a part of the Fourth Amendment and he arbitrarily picks, I think, the first part, the reasonableness clause and he proposes to substitute a policeman’s ad hoc judgment for the second, the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.255" offset="20041770">He seems to see this as a way of balancing interests, but yet, he never once points to interest, the police interest that needs to be balanced.</text>

            <text syncTime="5190.408" offset="20838400">Also, apparently, it was stipulated by Mr. Scott, Lewis’ attorney, that the testimony of Clyde Mann was supported by the full transcript of the tape proceedings which he had been furnished by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.497" offset="20898691">Now, the consent argument which was discussed, our argument on the consent issue is that the District Court never resolved the question of whether Mr. Lewis consented to the seizure of his automobile because the District Court held that it was not relevant since he did not consent to the search and the District Court found that the taking of the paint samples was a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.481" offset="20998687">In our brief, I think at page 20, we make the point that if the Court finds that the taking of the paint samples was not a search, then assuming even that the Court held that a warrant would be required for the seizure there appears to be a factual issue left unresolved by the District Court here as to whether there was consent to the seizure as distinct from the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="5291.554" offset="21242984">We are saying that the warrant requirement that that Court has adopted as attached to the reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment is what doesn’t apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5320.894" offset="21360327">The Warrant Clause only becomes applicable if the Court presumes the search to be unreasonable without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.128" offset="21389270">He, of course, is always entitled to the reasonableness protection, assuming that the nature of the action is either a search or a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.375" offset="21430230">I’m advised by one of my colleagues with reference to Justice Stewart’s question about the key to the locker that there’s a case before the Court now on petition for certiorari from the Fifth Circuit, United States against Grill, in which, key was taken from the petitioner upon his being jailed and the police learned of a duffel bag which the key fit from a confederate who indicated that it contained evidence of a cocaine importation conspiracy.</text>
