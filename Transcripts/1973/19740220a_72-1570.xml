            <label>Mr. David A. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="28.261" offset="189753">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.093" offset="197172">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.400" offset="210338">These case in on certiorari to the First Circuit Court of Appeals to review a judgment of that court vacating an order of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts which had denied without prejudice a petition for habeas corpus presented by the respondent pursuant to Title 28 Section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.666" offset="307409">The basis of the state custody of the petitioner in that proceeding had been affected by conviction in the state trial court of murder in the first degree and possession of firearms violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.259" offset="385776">The Respondent was indited in May of 1967 for murder in the first-degree and firearms possessions charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.675" offset="431438">He was apprehended approximately 20 months later and was brought to trial with a co-defendant when Gagliardi in April of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.569" offset="478981">The petitioner wishes to stress the components of that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.235" offset="497685">The trial was a seven-day trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.050" offset="508970">It was preceded with pre trial discovery including a pre trial discovery motions seven of which were allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.121" offset="541257">One of the pre trial discovery motions was a motion for Bill of Particulus which according to Massachusetts practice was read to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.192" offset="573544">Additionally, the trial included opening instructions by the judge to the jury opening remarks by council.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.201" offset="601548">The testimony of two primary police witnesses, two secondary police witnesses, a chemist, a ballisticians, a pathologist, two FBI agents and several civilian witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.139" offset="669257">Additionally at the cost of the trial, several exhibits were introduced including weapons and documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.272" offset="705829">Additional components of the trial included closing remarks by the Assistant District Attorney, Defense Council, closing instruction by the jury and an sworn statement by the Respondent as a Defendant, a practice which was in effect in 1969 in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.100" offset="805198">It should also be noted that the trial was preceded by a view.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.835" offset="828082">Those are the components of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.224" offset="837695">The Fannies of which is in question before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.366" offset="854204">The uncontradicted evidence before the court tended to show that the Respondent along with three other persons was seen in a car at approximately 4 o’clock in morning on April 18, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.074" offset="913032">He was seen there by two police officers each of whom testified at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.693" offset="931527">The uncontradicted evidence further tends to show that when Gagliardi, the co-defendant was the driver of the car that the respondent in the case before this Court, then Defendant Dechristoforo was a passenger in the rear seat of the car seated behind Gagliardi that a third alive passenger, Oreto, was also seated in the back seat, and then a fourth person when Lanzi, who appeared to be asleep, was in the front passenger seat of the cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.950" offset="1072588">The evidence further tends to show that Dechristoforo and Gagliardi were questioned by the police at the seen prior to the determination by the police that Lanzi was not in fact asleep but was dead, having been shot once in the head and three times in the side.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.235" offset="1161718">Apparently and according to the uncontradicted testimony, Dechristoforo and Gagliardi were questioned at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.102" offset="1197140">Evidence which is contested in path was introduced at the trial to show that after seen Respondent Dechristoforo when questioned as to his own identity and purpose gave the police a wrong name, a wrong description of the reason why they would there in that place and identify the deceased victim by a name other than his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.518" offset="1302779">In effect, the respondent said did not say that his name was Dechristoforo, said that the disease person had been injured in a fight and revere and was been taken to the hospital and gave a wrong description, a wrong name with respect to the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.781" offset="1375922">Gagliardi and the Respondent Dechristoforo then left the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.029" offset="1392849">It was then determined that Lanzi was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.277" offset="1409881">The third occupant, the third live occupant of the cab was arrested at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.180" offset="1437466">During the course of the trial additionally, there was evidence that death had been cost by gunshot wounds that occurred in the cab between 3 and 4 o’clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.507" offset="1490756">Additionally at the scene, the police found a 38 revolver in the back seat where Oreto had been seated that had been shot once.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.791" offset="1547912">An additional weapon a derringer fully loaded on the floor in front of the seat were Respondent Dechristoforo had been seated and it was also evidence at the trial that a third revolver was laid to found buried in an area adjacent to the location of the cab and evidence by way of ballistics was introduced to show that the wound in the head in the decedent had been caused by the gun that was found on the back seat and that the three shots in the side of the decedent had been caused by that revolver that was laid to found buried behind the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.289" offset="1749891">Now, at the close of all of the evidence co-defendant Gagliardi pleaded guilty in the absence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.289" offset="1821884">When the jury was brought into the court room, the trial judge instructed or remark to the juries and I quote in the quote is contain on page 7 of the petitioners brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.678" offset="1879458">"Mr. Foreman and gentlemen of the jury, you have noted that the Defendant Gagliardi is not in the dock, he has pleaded guilty and his case has been disposed off."</text>
            <text syncTime="461.510" offset="1922821">We will, therefore go forward with the trial of the case of Commonwealth v. Dechristoforo that is detained also in the appendix record of page 99.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.300" offset="1965976">At that time consistent with what the petitioners suggests with the admirable trial tactics of defense council, no objection was made to that remark, no instruction was ask and no instruction was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.716" offset="2035566">Thereafter, Respondents’ council proceeded with his closing arguments to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.579" offset="2091050">The Prosecutors’ argument as is the custom in Massachusetts followed the defense council’s closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.163" offset="2129398">And at the beginning, I hesitate to read to the court and yet, I am reluctant to read a single remark to this court without reading some of the context in which that single remark occurred.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="531.346" offset="2202122">From petitioner’s brief Your Honor at page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.381" offset="2218318">The Prosecutor’s closing remarks and its entirety appears in the record appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.558" offset="2251024">The Prosecutor’s closing argument let me prefess my argument by saying that first of all, I am aware that when I say is really an argument because the word argument pre supposes that I am prejudice to the cause that I represent which of course I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.656" offset="2319360">I Think that the very nature of the system being advisory pitting one side against the other naturally make you point to those things which you think support your particular position and to more or less ignore those things which I supposed detracked from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.860" offset="2388219">I would like to skip down one paragraph and I will seize reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.842" offset="2404101">And I realize that my closing argument should be in no way conceited by you as any evidence in the case and I am sure that you won’t consider it as that and I am sure that my opening statement to you is in no way evidence in the case and it won’t be conceited by you as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.329" offset="2482051">The Prosecutor in his argument, the Assistant District Attorney then went on to explain to the jury his version of the case but suffice it to say that he argued to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.435" offset="2530534">His argument is included in full in the record appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.391" offset="2558328">During that argument and the Assistant District Attorney made a statement which is contained in all of the paper in this case and in Petitioners brief at page 11, I do not know what they want you to do by way of a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.382" offset="2626247">They said that they hope you find him not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.303" offset="2637949">I quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.323" offset="2666057">An objection to this remark was immediately made and although the record is not completely clear on the point and I respectfully direct the Court’s attention to the record appendix at page 129.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.712" offset="2723631">At that point, Mr. Smith said I object to that. The court said I do not think Mr. Smith that is not fair argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.004" offset="2760725">The court know Mr. Smith that isn’t so.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.465" offset="2778593">I think to see and he say that the Assistant District Attorney then proceeded with his argument talking about another topic.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.695" offset="2811507">The record shows that the trial judge indicated that had an objection that the objection had in fact been sustained and that had counsel requested instruction at that time, they would have been given.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.330" offset="3158100">The judge in his charge First I think it’s only fair to say something about instructions that were requested by the defendants now respondents counsel specific instructions to the jury by way of a writing were made to the Court, they are also contained in the record's appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.392" offset="3234273">The Court did not give the specific instructions that were requested by Defendant’s counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="827.197" offset="3385574">And at page 143, the judge instructed the jury begging the Court’s indulgence for permission to read his instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.242" offset="3429669">Let me begin this charge by saying to you that as I have said with regard to unsworn statements not subject to cross-examination of the Defendant, it is not evidence, nor are arguments of counsel nor the opening of counsel whether it be the Assistant District Attorney in this case or whether it be Mr. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.897" offset="3512320">It is not evidence for your consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.691" offset="3763513">Now in his closing with District Attorney, I noted made a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.257" offset="3781799">I don’t know what they want you to do by way of a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.496" offset="3794756">They said they’ve hope that you find him not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.523" offset="3806877">I quiet frankly think that they hope you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.470" offset="3830596">There is no evidence of that whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.594" offset="3839164">Of course, you are instructed to disregard that statement made by the District Attorney consider the case as there is no such statement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.975" offset="3892663">The jury returned a verdict of murder in the first-degree with a recommendation of the death penalty not to be imposed and verdicts of guilty on each of two counts of a firearms charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.612" offset="3943236">The case prior to appeal in the State Courts are the defendant move for a new trial in the State Courts and the case was then appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth on several assignments of error including an assignment of the denial of the defendant’s motion for mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.324" offset="4030067">In other words, the question of the propriety and the alleged prejudice of the remarks made by Assistant District Attorney in his closing will brought to the full Court in Massachusetts.</text>
