            <text syncTime="21.254" offset="161750">The Pittsburgh case comes here from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.769" offset="183798">That court invalidated a taxing ordinance in the city of Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.450" offset="214518">The ordinance placed a special tax on off-street parking transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.165" offset="237401">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the tax was unduly high and that when combined with some other stiff competition from the city zone parking lots, the tax wasnâ€™t equivalent to an uncompensated confiscation of the property contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.864" offset="328202">We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.050" offset="344921">Under our prior cases, we do not think the city of Pittsburgh exceeded its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.861" offset="404167">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion in this case.</text>
