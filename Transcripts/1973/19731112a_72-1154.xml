            <text syncTime="44.838" offset="256104">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.719" offset="271673">Blair &amp; Co. was one of the larger stockbrokers in New York and it apparently ran into very severe financial trouble with the end of its fiscal year of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.397" offset="334367">And it appears that between 1969, that is September of 1969 and September of 1970, they gradually liquidated their company by giving away, literally giving away branches of their stock brokerage concern to other concerns, to which some of their employees are officers, went and became members of.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.385" offset="462263">They paid out or permitted subordinated debenture holders who were members of their Boards of Directors to get their money out of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.134" offset="513254">And late in September of 1970, they entered into a contract with a New York Stock Exchange special fund, by the terms of which, the special fund was permitted to appoint a person as a Liquidator to liquidate Blair &amp; Co. and, as a matter of form, the special fund loaned $1,000 to Blair &amp; Co. and proceeded to appoint a man, Mr. Scorese, as a Liquidator in a very carefully drawn and very ornate and very carefully drafted contract in which his powers was specifically set forth and in a power of attorney which clearly set forth all of his powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.770" offset="703843">And I submit to you, without going too deeply into the record, that there isn’t a power that appears in the contract or that appears in the power of attorney that differs in any way from any power that was ever given to any receiver or any trustee that was ever appointed by any court or was ever appointed by any insolvent debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.787" offset="803944">He was given greater powers than a receiver because he didn’t have to file a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.964" offset="828604">He didn’t have to apply to a court for leave to sell anything or to dispose off anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.360" offset="854204">And what is most important as distinguished from other agents, he was the sole judge of his own powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.526" offset="1110831">Apparently, the position taken by the New York Stock Exchange is that it is a power greater than the court because, by the constitution of the Exchange as I understand it, the powers were limited to arbitration within the New York Stock Exchange and, as a matter of fact, these very petitioners sought to rescind their contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.136" offset="1357322">And in order for my client to go into court and to sue as a subordinated creditor, they would’ve been faced with the overwhelming burden of having to establish, firstly, that there were sufficient assets in Blair &amp; Co. to pay all of the un-subordinated creditors before their right to sue would arise.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.372" offset="1754279">I don’t know that it’s authorized by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.289" offset="1761907">It’s authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission where the New York Stock Exchange is permitted to avoid the consequences of other acts by arrangements with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.369" offset="1810181">I do know that these petitioning creditors in this case, when they sought to rescind their lending to Blair &amp; Co., were compelled to go through what seemed to us a very unfair and one-sided arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.026" offset="1884891">The basic question on this appeal, lies in the fact that within four or five days of the appointment of the Liquidator we petitioned Blair &amp; Co. into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.333" offset="1954064">We cited three acts of bankruptcy, two of which were eliminated by Referee Herzog and were not pursued in as much as he held in our favor on the basic issue of the appointment of the Liquidator.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.741" offset="2015713">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.076" offset="2045074">Our position was, as with Shakespeare, that a rose smells as sweet no matter what its name that this Mr. Scorese, although named as a Liquidator and at other times as an agent, actually came within the intent of this statute, and a reading of the history of this statute bears this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.260" offset="2153744">This statute was first enacted in the Bankruptcy Act in 1903, and it was subsequently amended on several occasions into its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.225" offset="2197629">And throughout the several amendments, the basic expression that was involved here was the doctrine of the appointment of somebody to take charge of a liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.290" offset="2249874">This was the essential concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.219" offset="2265652">In the use of the words in the statute, it apparently was limited to a receiver or a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.531" offset="2298880">But, at the time this petition was filed, every case, every text, as I’ve cited in my brief before this Court which I won’t bother to repeat it, held that a Liquidator came within the scope of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.714" offset="2379651">It could’ve been a simple thing for these petitioning creditors to have gone into the State Court of New Jersey and move for the appointment of the state court receiver, and then file a petition in bankruptcy which would have clearly come under Section 3 (a) (5) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.586" offset="2451122">But because of the exigencies of the situation where the four-month period was about to run out and, as a matter of fact we filed it on the last day, was about to run out on about $3.5 million worth of preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.250" offset="2521757">Based upon the texts and upon the laws, we filed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.660" offset="2539416">And as it had been promulgated to that date, we filed the petition directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.319" offset="2561985">And our position on this appeal and the decision of Referee Herzog below and the decision of Judge Cooper below have clearly held that the appointment of Mr. Scorese came within the scope of Section 3 (a) (5) of the Bankruptcy Act despite the fact that, in their wisdom, the attorneys who represented Blair &amp; Co. or the New York Stock Exchange shows to denominate and designate purely as a matter of naming Mr. Scorese not as a trustee which he actually was, not as a receiver which he actually was, but as a liquidating agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.616" offset="4987193">As far as Leo Raines is concerned, it is a very important and non-moot.[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.266" offset="5013838">It is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.356" offset="5030139">I have rested, if I may go back to my case in chief, I have rested my position on this appeal, as I did below, on the fact that this Court has ruled to get it again on basic paramount issues that the Bankruptcy Act and the Federal Courts have paramount an exclusive jurisdiction of the liquidation of insolvent estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.591" offset="5155109">Based upon the cases of the Bank of Marin against England, and Pepper against Litton, the doctrine that substance will not give way to form and that technical considerations will not prevent substantial justice from being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.751" offset="5223758">Now, these principles were followed by other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.488" offset="5242671">In 1941, in the District Court of Oklahoma, a petition was filed which was technically incorrect and the court itself, in rendering its opinion, stated that it had very serious doubts whether technically it came within the specific scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.236" offset="5325740">But the court said the court will not stand on a technicality with reference to form when substance is alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.008" offset="5356774">And it held, that despite its doubt that the appointment of a Liquidator by contract constituted an assignment for the benefit of creditors, nonetheless found it sufficient to constitute an act of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.765" offset="5411840">Now this case, in the manner of R.V. Smith, was cited in Talius (ph), cited in Remington, the two leading text on the subject, as the guide to which we attorneys follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.161" offset="5469414">And, as I’ve cited in my brief, Talius specifically said in so many words, on page 4 -- that a liquidating trust -- that a Liquidator appointed by contract came within the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.000" offset="5560738">In 1953, Judge Winfield, who I’m certain Your Honors will recognize as one of the outstanding jurists on the question of Bankruptcy, wrote a landmark decision in which he argued -- in which he stated, if I may, I’ve cited it in my briefs, again following the principle of Pepper against Litton, “it is not required that the transferee of the property be formally appointed as trustee by a ceremonial document referring to him as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.036" offset="5716846">The method adopted to affect the transfer is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.771" offset="5731788">It is the end result that counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.213" offset="5745580">Any action by one who is insolvent which effectively causes the transfer of his property to another for final liquidation purposes appoints the transferee a trustee to take charge of his property under Section 3 Subdivision (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.636" offset="5811304">Now, this is the point we make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.810" offset="5823948">Mr. Scorese, whether you named him an agent or a Liquidator, a trustee, or a receiver was the identical person given the identical powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.367" offset="5862191">He was given completely in charge unlike an agent, as I’ve cited in Bogart and Trusts, unlike an agent, he had no responsibility to his principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.334" offset="5914122">As you read the contract, you realize that he was the sole judge of his own acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.117" offset="5937215">He was a trustee in every sense of the word, although called an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.801" offset="5959993">And as I say to Your Honors, in looking at the substance rather than the language used rather than the form, you must hold that Mr. Scorese in his appointment was a trustee in every sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.323" offset="6010044">He was fully in charge and responsible to nobody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.282" offset="6025927">He could buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.816" offset="6031987">He could sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.669" offset="6035435">He could transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.894" offset="6040346">He could sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.919" offset="6044421">He could do everything that an owner could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.990" offset="6056751">But, in an attempt to avoid the paramount that exclusive jurisdiction of these courts, he was deliberately given another name in the hope of avoiding the consequences of his appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.189" offset="6109518">And so I say my basic argument is that, in looking at this substance of his appointment, we came clearly within the scope of the intent of Congress in enacting 3 (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.077" offset="6157061">And the latest manifestation of Congress’ intent is in the enactment of the Stockholders Protective Investment Act where in Section 5, under this new law which, frankly, was occasion as a result of the Blair insolvency and the insolvency of a few of the large stockbrokers houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.221" offset="6245669">The Congress specifically designated the appointment by a court and specifically stated that a court could find the jurisdiction under this Act if it found this that the particular debtor is the subject of a proceeding pending in any court or before the agency of the United States or any state in which a receiver, trustee, or Liquidator for such member has been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.255" offset="6381819">So that, if a Liquidator is appointed, if they do this again, that is if the Stock Exchange takes it upon itself to control its own liquidation under the Stock Holders Protective Investment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.290" offset="6433959">Congress has declared its intention that liquidations must be under court control and not until private control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.826" offset="6468023">This has been a tragic situation because if this order of confirmation stands, approximately $10 million was withdrawn illegally out of this corporation and this Liquidator, this so-called representative who was supposed to take charge of these assets did nothing to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.022" offset="6564885">They gave away branches of their company throughout the United States, and no investigation was ever made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.996" offset="6604696">In the record is the story of a giveaway of $100,000 to a man by the name of Ligon (ph) as liquidated damages for a contract which was never performed, done within a few weeks prior to the filing of a petition and filing to the filing of the-- prior to the appointment of the Liquidator, and he never did a thing to get that $100,000 back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.919" offset="6700408">There were $21 million of subordinated creditors who had been wiped out in this Chapter 11 proceeding, completely wiped out all at the liquidation of a private Liquidator appointed by the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.477" offset="6778671">This is a situation where, under Section 3 (a) (5), we have a right to supersede a court appointed receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.953" offset="6812526">We have a right to supersede a statutory assignment for the benefit of creditors, to supersede a common law deed of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.859" offset="6848157">And yet, the court below has held that we cannot supersede the appointment of a private Liquidator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.120" offset="6877205">Now, that is not justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.510" offset="6886818">That is not the intent of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.261" offset="6897789">This court, that is the Federal Courts, have exclusive jurisdiction and I respectfully ask Your Honors to reverse the Court of Appeals below and reinstate the adjudication of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.430" offset="6950452">Thank you for your kindly attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.682" offset="6987442">I represent the respondents in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.480" offset="6998622">It is our position, Your Honors, that the cause presented today is moot by reason of the determination of the Chapter 11 proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.577" offset="7031014">Approximately two weeks ago, we filed a memorandum in which we suggested that the cause is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.336" offset="7054106">Subsequent to the filing of that memorandum, Mr. Raines filed a reply or an answering memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.386" offset="7078243">And basically, Mr. Raines had raised 12 points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.133" offset="7097260">He agrees 100% with each of the authorities which we have cited to show that the cause is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.917" offset="7120457">However, he says that the Court should consider the merits of this matter for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.994" offset="7144699">One, he did not receive notice of entry of the order of confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.169" offset="7161417">Notice of a hearing to consider confirmation of the arrangement was given by the Bankruptcy Court to all parties in interest, including Mr. Raines and his clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.751" offset="7203736">Under Rule 77 (d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as well as Rule 922 (a) of the Rules of Bankruptcy Practice which became effective on October 1, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.638" offset="7243337">There is no requirement that notice of entry be given and it specifically states that lack of notice of the entry does not affect the time to appeal or relieve of authorize the court to relieve a body for failure to appeal within the time allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.191" offset="7297463">The order of confirmation is final for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.026" offset="7308852">Distribution has been made to creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.478" offset="7350648">We were served, Your Honor, with a motion which I believe is returnable December 5 to reconsider his clients’ claims, and I will get to that, if you will, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.553" offset="7390981">Mr. Raines says in his second point that the order of confirmation was entered prematurely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.126" offset="7417208">Mr. Raines, on behalf of his client, made a motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 proceeding and the basis of the dismissal of the Chapter 11 proceeding was that you could not have an arrangement in this type of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.993" offset="7460676">And, as I have found in practicing in the Bankruptcy Court, when you don’t have much law it becomes almost academic to cite Pepper v. Litton because the Bankruptcy practitioners take the position that under Pepper v. Litton you could do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.403" offset="7510309">Well the motion to dismiss was denied by an order and an opinion of Referee Babbitt dated February 16, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.550" offset="7546984">And in the final paragraph of that opinion, Referee Babbitt said “Foley’s motion must be denied in all respects and upon this order becoming final, it is expected that Blair will move promptly to a confirmation of its arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.505" offset="7598811">Its creditors have waited long enough.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.404" offset="7614380">Subsequent to February 16 and with the constant prodding of the Bankruptcy Court, over 9,500 claims were objected to and resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.762" offset="8795847">I never made any such statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2190.255" offset="8837747">Mr. Raines pays no attention to the fact that approximately 9,500 claims were objected to. Trials were heard before the bankruptcy court, and those claims were resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.083" offset="8873064">Moreover, there aren’t objections pending as 80% of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.386" offset="8890305">All Blair did was reserve its right to file objections if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.645" offset="8907337">If Blair does not file objections within 90 days, then those claims are allowed automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.761" offset="8935758">His next point is that Foley’s motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 petition was denied by the Referee in bankruptcy who was strongly influenced by the decision of United States Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.218" offset="8981629">Mr. Raines does not advise the court in his memorandum that an appeal was filed from the denial of a motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 proceeding, was heard in the United States District Court for the Seventh District of New York and the Referee in bankruptcy was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.019" offset="9040875">And former Chief Judge Sylvester Ryan held that the grounds argued by Foley for dismissal to be frivolous and without merit or substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.145" offset="9073371">Mr. Foley never took an appeal from that decision and that is a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.024" offset="9092807">His next point is that the New York Stock Exchange was being unjustly enriched and creditors might possibly get a greater return in liquidation under the supervision of a court appointed trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.685" offset="9135438">Well, even if this Court were to reverse, the Chapter 11 proceeding is finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.432" offset="9150485">Besides which, and specifically provided by Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act, you may have a provision and an arrangement whereby, on the confirmation or the conclusion of the proceeding, the remaining assets of a debtor are transferred to a third party, usually it’s the party who put up the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.654" offset="9215373">Now, in the case of Bache, the New York Stock Exchange advanced $20.4 million to satisfy customer creditor claims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.030" offset="9248914">The assets remaining to Blair in no way measure up to $20.4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.705" offset="9275559">In addition, in order to confirm a Chapter 11 proceeding, under Section 366 of the Bankruptcy Act, the Bankruptcy Court must make a determination that the arrangement is for the best interest of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.316" offset="9326028">The phrase “best interest of creditors” has been construed to mean “and require a determination by the bankruptcy court that the creditors will receive more in satisfaction of their claims pursuant to the Chapter 11 arrangement, and they would receive in a liquidation of the estate in ordinary bankruptcy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.924" offset="9392483">And there was an evidentiary hearing before the referee in bankruptcy and he made a finding that this arrangement was in the best interest of creditors that they would receive more under the arrangement than they would receive in the event of a liquidation under ordinary bankruptcy Chapters 1 through 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.198" offset="9457580">Mr. Raines’ next point is that an adjudication in bankruptcy can be used as a fulcrum upon which a more complete investigation and interrogation to the very justice of the plan and a reconsideration of the best interest of creditors should be predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.090" offset="9525081">This arrangement was proposed by Blair on May 25, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.023" offset="9544829">Mr. Foley and all of the other creditors had at least two-and-a-half years to conduct whatever investigation they desired for the terms of the arrangement, the assets, liabilities or affairs of Blair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.266" offset="9585789">In point of fact, Mr. Foley, through his attorneys, conducted extensive examinations of officers, employees of Blair, as well as Liquidator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.604" offset="9627167">We submit that the bankruptcy proceedings are terminated by the final order of confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.903" offset="9648379">Mr. Raines goes on in his next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.783" offset="9655902">He says the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is a re-pleased throughout his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.154" offset="9701355">He says that the decision is a royal road to our beacon-like to fraud and deceit and chicanery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.391" offset="9734269">He never once mentions that there are other acts of bankruptcy which could be alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.921" offset="9756421">If Blair was engaged in fraud, if Blair did make a fraudulent claim, Section 3 has six acts of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.515" offset="9782857">If he missed on this one, he could’ve filed a petition in which he alleged that it was a fraudulent conveyance, in which he alleged there was a preference, in which he alleged that Blair admitted in writing its inability to pay its debts as they matured and its willingness to be adjudged the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.370" offset="9838237">Mr. Raines has referred to four-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.818" offset="9848059">Many of the acts of bankruptcy in Section 3 are not limited by a four-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.188" offset="9869479">A fraudulent conveyance can be six years under state law, New York State that is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.729" offset="9951713">That so-called giveaway was in connection with the sale of a management contract for the Blair fund, that is, the position of Mr. Foley that Blair should have received a profit on the sale of that management contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.893" offset="10000300">Subsequent decisions by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in Rosenfeld versus Black, have established now that you cannot make a profit on the sale of that contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.178" offset="10049411">Blair did deposit with the respective purchaser a $100,000 to serve his liquidated damages in the event that it did not perform in accordance with the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.275" offset="10113881">We have told Mr. Raines, we have told Mr. Foley that an action was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York and every effort was being made to recover that $100,000, and it just goes over the waterways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.737" offset="10163722">The action was commenced in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.528" offset="10174903">In point of fact, that it was tried three or four months ago and by decision dated October 31, 1973 was decided by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, unfortunately, for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.177" offset="10225476">His next point is that Blair seeks -- Foley, I’m sorry, seeks the recovery of securities he deposited with Blair and which are subordinated to the claims of other creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.836" offset="10268108">This is not the first effort that Mr. Foley has made to recover his securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.699" offset="10287543">Before the bankruptcy proceedings, Mr. Foley commenced an action against Blair.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.548" offset="10358909">Mr. Foley litigated his right to receive back those securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.399" offset="10382315">He lost the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.437" offset="10390465">The securities were deemed to be the securities of Blair for the satisfaction of claims of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.154" offset="10413349">The only reason why these particular securities were not sold is that they are unregistered and they’re restricted or some of the securities are subject to the 1% rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.606" offset="10447203">Otherwise, they would’ve been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.387" offset="10454309">He has no right to those securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.867" offset="10460264">The arbitration award was confirmed by an order of the Supreme Court of the States of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.599" offset="10479177">Mr. Foley never took an appeal from that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.468" offset="10494642">In point of fact, I might also add, that Mr. Foley has pending at the present time two plenary actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.326" offset="10522018">He is suing all of the officers and directors of Blair alleging 10 (b) (5) violations in common law fraud, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.272" offset="10553887">He is also suing the New York Stock Exchange in a plenary action in which he is asserting that the New York Stock Exchange failed to exercise and perform its duties of self-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.657" offset="10595370">So, that point has nothing to do with what this Court may do with this particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.323" offset="10618044">His next to the last point is that he is liable, Mr. Foley, for a cause awarded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.814" offset="10648033">As Mr. Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, there is an unbroken line of cases which establishes the rule that controversy as to cause alone does not salvage an otherwise moot the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.469" offset="11978606">The only grounds that Blair might have had to stay a plenary action was that there was an arbitration contract and compelled to whoever was suing Blair to go into arbitration under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.487" offset="12026671">But that’s only as to member firms.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="3041.160" offset="12241398">Exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.737" offset="12243696">And, in effect what would happen upon the appointment of receiver would be that the property would past into custodial legist and creditors would be constrained to file claims with the receiver and they would share pro rata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.880" offset="12284238">This is exactly the point in Bonnie Classics which is relied on very heavily by Referee Herzog and Judge Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.601" offset="12307122">In the case of Bonnie Classics, when the corporation decided to liquidate under the New York Stock Corporation Law, the Board of Directors became vested with title as trustees and creditors were restrained from proceeding against the property of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.264" offset="12361770">They had to wait until the assets were liquidated, the trust rates were distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.587" offset="12383086">Every case in which it has been held that there is a receiver or a trustee appointed under 3 (a) (5), there has been an inhibition against the creditors proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.707" offset="12415582">This was not the case in connection with Blair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.013" offset="12424777">In fact, there is a District Court case in Ray Ambrose Matthews and Co. which we cite in our brief in which there was a similar type agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.074" offset="12457064">And the court held, and this is a District Court decision in New Jersey, as the instrument brought about no change in title to the property, either absolute or condition, nothing was conveyed nor transferred by it and it could not hinder, delay, or defraud creditors because any creditor could proceed to satisfy his claim from the corporation’s property to the same extent as though the instrument did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.478" offset="12542642">That is exactly the situation which occurred in connection with Blair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.805" offset="12563958">Essentially, Mr. Scorese was an agent of the Board of Directors of Blair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.608" offset="12587154">He had no greater powers than the Board of Directors had and he dealt with the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.617" offset="12599171">In fact, he could be removed by Blair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.195" offset="12609515">All Blair had to do at that point in time was pay back to the New York Stock Exchange $1,000 and Mr. Scorese’s appointment was vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.996" offset="12648699">And I might add on the $1,000, Your Honor, it’s simply a question in order to trigger the appointment of a Liquidator, the Exchange had to advance some money. Eventually, $20.4 million came into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.152" offset="12701362">Now, in connection with the merits of the matter, under Section 3 (a) (5), the statute is very specific in talking about a receiver or a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.838" offset="12736052">It’s our position that the receiver or trustee must be judicially appointed or appointed pursuant to a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.171" offset="12761443">And Mr. Raines has alluded to the development of Section 3 (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.924" offset="12784431">We have set forth in some detail in our brief how the statute was developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.671" offset="12811389">The point which is relied upon very heavily by the petitioners here is that in the 1926 Amendment to Section 3 (a) (5), the words “appointed pursuant to the laws of any state or territory” were deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.169" offset="12881398">As Chief Judge Friendly has noted in the majority opinion in the Court of Appeals and as we have set forth in our brief, the elimination of those words were described in the House Report as only a phraseology and there was no intent to change the substance of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.888" offset="12972304">And Chief Judge Friendly has gone into great detail in connection with the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.026" offset="12996859">Furthermore, when Congress intended to use the language “an agent authorized to liquidate property,” and Congress has used that language in Section 2 (a) (21) which was amended as part of the or brought into the Bankruptcy Act as part of a Chandler Act of 1938, it specifically refers to an agent to authorized to liquidate property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.704" offset="13079615">In 1952, the statute was amended again Section 69 (d) and that language was put into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.969" offset="13108663">In 69 (d), the statute puts under the jurisdiction of the court an agent authorized to liquidate for the purposes of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.071" offset="13145025">We submit on the basis of the amendments in the legislative history that if Congress had intended to include as an act of bankruptcy the appointment of an agent authorized to liquidate, it would’ve said so, as Chief Judge Friendly has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.430" offset="13198420">We believe and we submit to the Court that this is a matter for the legislature to deal with, and I might point out to the Court that there is presently pending before the House and before the Senate a new Bankruptcy Act H.R. 10792 which is legislatively going to change the acts of bankruptcy and will include in those acts of bankruptcy an agent authorized to liquidate property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.085" offset="13297058">On the basis of that, we submit that this is something that should be left to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.305" offset="13310015">This Court should not enlarge Section 3 (a) (5) so that a petition can be filed simply because an agent is appointed to liquidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.771" offset="13343869">Filing a bankruptcy petition is not a matter which should be taken lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.863" offset="13364245">There are many, many factors that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.809" offset="13375948">There are many, many people that are affected by the filing of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.555" offset="13390994">In this case, customs were adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.633" offset="13403324">Securities and Exchange Commission issued a release in which they pointed out that the administration of these proceedings had caused an additional $5 million by reason of a bankruptcy petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.003" offset="13448777">They criticized the filing of the petition and the allowance of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.071" offset="13476989">This is a situation which, frankly, I was little surprised to be here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.285" offset="13493917">I was sure that this is a case that requires no further action by any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.363" offset="13514188">The case is finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.311" offset="13517949">The customers have been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.120" offset="13525264">The creditors have received the distribution to the extent their claims have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.440" offset="13542504">And very substantial administration expenses have already been paid out.</text>
