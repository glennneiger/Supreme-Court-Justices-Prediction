            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments next in 73-557, Jenkins against Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.812" offset="212010">Mr. Nizer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="35.904" offset="220369">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.426" offset="230504">This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Georgia which affirmed a criminal conviction for the exhibition in a local theater in Albany, Georgia of a motion picture entitled “Carnal Knowledge”.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.940" offset="300513">The defendant, Billy Jenkins who was a manager of the theater was fined $750 and sentenced to one year probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.940" offset="344503">The fine has not yet been paid and the probation has been stayed pending of all appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.936" offset="380447">There is no question that only persons of 18 years of age or older were admitted or would be admitted to the theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.504" offset="422766">Minors or juveniles are not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.375" offset="446276">Also, this case does not involve obtrusive exhibition to unwilling persons nor does it involve pandering despite the trial judges’ instruction to the jury held to be a proper judge by the Supreme Court of Georgia and despite the undisputed fact that there isn’t any alter of evidence in the record of pandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.450" offset="554527">This alone, I shall later allude to as my argument on due process as sufficient for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.498" offset="586710">The issue in this case is of sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.487" offset="602697">“Carnal Knowledge” which has been decided obscene by the Supreme Court of Georgia has been proclaimed by discriminating critics throughout our country as a serious, artistic work.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.532" offset="658913">And its distinction derives from the combined talents of many of America’s leading contemporary artist as Mike Nichols, the well-known stage and motion picture director.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.175" offset="717427">Jules Feiffer, a satirist and playwright, Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen and Ann Margaret who incidentally won the Academy Award nomination for her performance in this very picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.228" offset="769672">And “Carnal knowledge” has played to 17,500,000 people in some 5000 theaters in small and large cities including the State of Georgia, enjoying popular and discriminating acceptance and then an investigator from the Sheriff's Office in Albany, Georgia sees the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.805" offset="863922">One month later, Jenkins was arrested for having exhibited this film and the sole charge was public indecency.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.810" offset="911987">He was tried by a jury which was instructed that he could also be convicted of two other crimes for which he had not been charged namely obscenity and pandering, reversible again.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.715" offset="979592">The jury after announcing that it was hopelessly deadlocked, it would stay here until July 4, finally brought in a general verdict of guilty, so that we cannot tell on what of these three counts, two of them illegally judged, improperly judged, he was convicted of.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.516" offset="1066841">On appeal to the Georgia’s Supreme Court and without hearing oral argument, the Supreme Court of Georgia upheld this decision by four to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.226" offset="1113652">And our appeal from that decision presents one particular constitutional issue which is of profound significance to cultural freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.795" offset="1155971">And that is, will the sensitive regard for First Amendment rights evidenced by the clear announcement in the Miller decision that “hard core” pornography and only “hard core” pornography maybe suppressed, be permitted to be stretched and grievously misinterpreted, so as to strike down a work of serious literary and artistic achievement such as “Carnal Knowledge”.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.684" offset="1271536">The dissenting opinions in the Georgia Supreme Court expressed shock that exhibiting so meritorious motion picture should be a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.503" offset="1314795">And that apprehension, Your Honors, has swept through all the creative elements of our nation as the plethora of amicus briefs in this case indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.411" offset="1366413">From producers who fear to risk production, to theater owners who fear to exhibit on pain of criminal involvement, to book publishers who fear to print beyond the safe norm, to authors who fear to be innovative and most important of all to the public which maybe deprived of access to aesthetic diversity which flourishes best when the orders does not reigned in and when we must not conform to the lowest common denominator of safe presentation and the damage we state here is not only to the work which has been barred but the less visible and subtle encroachment, self-censorship due to one’s certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.058" offset="1569019">In short, Your Honors, the decision appealed from though have a chilling, indeed a freezing effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.495" offset="1622727">Unless, -- unless, the threat of this holding of obscenity is dealt with by vigorous renunciation and the limitation of “hard core” pornography is declared to be what the Miller decision so emphatically stated it to be, the soul exception to the protective shield of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.176" offset="1713424">Professor Bickel had written in 1962, that the radiating consequences of decisions impinging on the First Amendment would encourage Constancian tendencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.028" offset="1768908">And recently, he stated that this decision on “Carnal Knowledge” does not conform to the ruling of the Supreme Court in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.747" offset="1807778">Indeed, Your Honors, it doesn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.401" offset="1818331">It is unthinkable that this picture should be confused with “hard core” pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.217" offset="1849574">The film depicts two college students over a span of about 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.092" offset="1885100">They grow older but they don’t grow up.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.699" offset="1899520">They are preoccupied with sex but the picture is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.091" offset="1921149">It does not bombard the senses with erotica, driving out all other ideas which is a typical characteristic of “hard core” pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.037" offset="1964931">On the contrary, it depicts the failure of the boys’ lives though they are successful in their professional careers because they cannot establish meaningful relationships and they are ultimately crushed by boredom, loneliness and impotency.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.377" offset="2042253">The picture deals with the human predicament resulting from the enthronement of impersonal detachment, the inability to love and the sequelae of cruelty and psychic illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.386" offset="2094289">And this artistic treatment of this problem which besets this decade and has evoked many social and philosophical studies has been the subject that plays in the past from Sternbergh to Tennessee Williams and that is why the New York Times reviewer called it “profound”, the Saturday Review “mature”, the Atlanta Journal “one of the best films in the long time” and the Catholic Film Newsletter despite some reservations, “a perceptive and brilliant put down of a certain lifestyle.”</text>
            <text syncTime="543.907" offset="2252382">And that many critics throughout the country who have heaped similar praise upon this picture, certainly all couldn’t have been fantasizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.479" offset="2290625">The language in this picture, Your Honors, is blunt although not within dictionary distance of the erotic poem in Kois against Wisconsin which this Court understandably held was not obscene because it bore “some ear muffs” of an attempt at serious odd even though the authors reach, exceeded his grasp, as Your Honor said.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.315" offset="2398041">Here, it can be claimed credibly that a literary and artistic standard was achieved and it was not beyond the grasp of the multiple talents which reach for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.763" offset="2459794">The story in “Carnal Knowledge” predominates over any visual presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.921" offset="2492395">The greatest care was lavished on sex, lighting, camera effects, musical score, brilliant ensemble acting, all under the direction of Nichols, a claimed among the most gifted of cinematographic artists who synthesized the ancient arts of painting, writing, composing, acting in a new universal medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.734" offset="2599706">And the resulting dominant effect of the picture as a whole is a sincere and earnest effort to create a literary and artistic work and to confuse that result with pornographic imbecility is cultural illiteracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.970" offset="2676611">The decision below ignores inexcusably the Miller distinction between commerce and ideas and the commercial exploitation of sex for its own sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.301" offset="2729900">And it does make the distribution of films and book a more hazardous enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.834" offset="2764069">Now, this Court has reserved the right of independent review of a constitutional fact of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.234" offset="2805656">And we submit respectfully that the answer is clear that “Carnal Knowledge” is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.186" offset="2837525">Now, another reversible error which we urge was that the Supreme Court of Georgia in its opinion maybe interpreted to have applied the community standard to determine whether the work had value.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.824" offset="2904085">It is somewhat ambiguous but that ambiguity is cleared up, Your Honor because in the subsequent decision by the same Court, the Supreme Court of Georgia in Slaton against Paris Adult Theater, it was clear that it expressly applied community standards to all parts of the obscenity test.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.946" offset="2988513">Now, of course this is fatal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.979" offset="3000633">Even if a majority of the people in the community thought otherwise, Chaucer and Boccaccio, and Ravalet and Fielding would still have literary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.206" offset="3049535">The test is quality not popularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.318" offset="3066044">And that is based on the inherent evaluation of the whole work not by poll taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.649" offset="3095301">A work which has literary value has therefore the impregnable shelter of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.510" offset="3126753">It cannot be subjected to the other two tests of obscenity, default that it’s immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.942" offset="3152562">So, we need go no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.146" offset="3161339">But the fact is that the remaining two tests of obscenity are also not met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.532" offset="3190909">“Carnal Knowledge” does not appeal to prurient interest nor is it patently offensive nor does it depict “hard core” sexual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.933" offset="3236467">The work belies any purpose to titillate or to exploit sex commercially for its own sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.829" offset="3272098">The camera is almost always on the faces of the characters not below.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.420" offset="3294459">The camera angles are deliberately discreet picturing the least not the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.034" offset="3324865">And when the point is made it terminates the scene not extending it with explicitness and sex is treated in this film as a sometimes battling and exasperating part of life but without lewdness or (Inaudible) and briefly stated that Your Honors, material cannot be obscene unless it meets all three tests of Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.780" offset="3435833">“Carnal Knowledge” is a film which meets none of these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.841" offset="3464150">How large should or must the community be which determines the applicable standard for pruriency and offensiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.459" offset="3506573">The state decisions your honor have varied and conflicted with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.014" offset="3528829">Some apply in state like New York and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.456" offset="3546593">Some apply in the local like Florida and Alabama and one state both, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.179" offset="3577417">In this case, the Supreme Court of Georgia held that a local standard was permissible but gave no clue as to whether that local meant county, city, neighborhood, block or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.043" offset="3652963">And that local standard is therefore void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.950" offset="3668532">Moreover, even if the local area were specified or defined precisely, we believe, it would create constitutionally intolerable consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.424" offset="3726420">Let me cite a few facts in support of that contention because we urge that the State geographical limit is to be the minimum requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.767" offset="3767798">Mr. Nizer, can I ask -- I believe, let’s assume you’re correct in saying that under Miller, a movie would not be obscene unless and it was “hard core” or let me assume that it’s “hard core”, whatever you might mean by “hard core”.</text>

            <text syncTime="989.054" offset="4032993">Well, again I just suggest that if it’s “hard core” pornography and it is that Miller limits obscenity definition to the argument about national and local standard, you are beside the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.371" offset="4102269">And the only reason I addressed myself to it is that this case raises several issues and it seems to us that in the interest of what Justice Brennan has referred to as the institutional burden on the Court to stop perhaps hundreds, maybe thousands of applications as to what is the area, the geographical area for community standard, that it might be worthwhile for this Court to examine this matter and I address myself to it even though case would be over if this case isn’t -- if the picture isn’t obscene at the end of it, reversal would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.248" offset="4241763">Indeed, it would be required on due process entirely apart even of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.132" offset="4261303">So, I wish to -- if this Court should wish to further examine this matter because as we read the Miller decision, it didn’t specify what the geographical area must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.622" offset="4323265">It merely was permissible with respect to local or State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.305" offset="4337998">In their indications, it meant State to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.820" offset="4352000">I wanted to point out that even if the local area were precisely defined, we think that it would still create an intolerable burden on the First Amendment for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.768" offset="4411768">There are more that 78,200 separate political subdivisions in the 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.136" offset="4449280">There are approximately 14,800 Motion Picture theaters in the United States and in many states, these subdivisions overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.525" offset="4490867">Thus, a single theater or a bookstore could be located within a number of different subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.837" offset="4532140">This creates a sort of a crazy quilt of conflicting standards and all of this would cast intolerable burdens on the distribution and dissemination of communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.905" offset="4584385">Now, Your Honors, I’m sure recognized that isn’t feasible to prepare different versions of books and films for distribution in different parts of each State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.255" offset="4633809">These practical considerations invade the constitutional realm but they have a chilling effect on the expression of thought and that they compel the author, the producer to run the gauntlet of thousands upon thousands of uncertain determinations on pain of criminal punishment?</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.620" offset="4859193">You are having rejected the national standard, how much force is there in the argument that although we can see we have to do it for 50 different states, we shouldn’t have to go beyond that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="1205.748" offset="4899736">Great force in that the vulcanization of this issue of submissions to 78,000 potential divisions as against 50 states seems to me to be great in difference in degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.956" offset="4960549">And what we’re dealing here with is the rule of reason as this Court had said, no provision will be perfect and furthermore there is a natural division for State rights, since the statute is State statute and it seems to me rather natural to follow that sovereignty of that geographical area rather than omit its fragmentation to dozens of thousands of local communities each of which require definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.829" offset="5084056">So, I think it would at least diminish the chilling effect of these limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.769" offset="5127837">At least, I respectfully submit that’s a great possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.086" offset="5153123">Now, another form of constitutional inhibition caused by local standards is that an affirmance by the highest Court of that State of a purely local finding of obscenity, in effect, forecloses other local areas within the State from their right to make their own test, not legally but psychologically and as Justice Holmes wrote in a dissenting opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.073" offset="5281019">Local standards, he said, placed in the hands of the few, the taste of cultural advancement of the many who are members of the greater State community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.364" offset="5330233">So, where this is a State statute, it is more reasonable to insist upon a State standard thus also limiting the number of confusions and the hodgepodge of local areas overlapping with each other and coming to this Court to ask whether they are constitutionally viable standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.970" offset="5600653">The little town of a block or the neighborhood, more probability of inhibitions upon First Amendments state less and even national still less, therefore I think the tendency ought to be to make the geographical area larger and by natural boundaries at least the minimum requirement ought to be the State which I read the Miller decision to tend to, although I’m not certain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.063" offset="6261029">I believe very strongly in the jury system that when they decide facts, when they decide constitutional facts, and I think as this Court properly said, you reserve to yourselves the independent review because of the overall umbrella of constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.619" offset="6347233">And I would distinguish jury inviolability between ordinary facts in which I trust their commonsense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.953" offset="6388611">They add some comment and I believe in them, but when it comes to a constitutional fact as Professor Bickel said, if a jury decided that a woman’s leg was up seen, this Court would be urged from or if it was decided that the statue of David must have fig leaf on it, this Court would be heard from and we wouldn’t accept the jury’s decision even though I trust their wisdom generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.351" offset="6486204">And it is because of this question being instinct with constitutional problems that we urge that special consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.184" offset="6529463">I may say in all candor, since the question of national standard has come up, understanding Your Honors’ ruling and accepting it respectfully that there is too much diversity in a large country such as ours to have a national standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.453" offset="6594560">But if this Court were to give further consideration to that matter, I would like to submit diffidently three reflections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.711" offset="6631549">First, there is what I would like to call a technological equalizer in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.984" offset="6664673">The media today, the same columnist in different newspapers, News Week, Time magazine all over the nation, ease of travel etcetera have reduced the diversity in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.247" offset="6721724">Not entirely, but have reduced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.256" offset="6733740">Secondly, I think there is diversity within the State and within the locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.408" offset="6758400">Upstate is different from downstate in many areas and indeed in the locality, the urban and the other city certified aspect that even of a small town is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.254" offset="6813780">Finally, in the Federal Obscenity Act, Your Honor and in other such areas as mail and transportation, international transportation, we take a national standard and I would think that we would not be unhappy if Your Honors decided because of these considerations to perhaps set a national standard on the matter of this importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.886" offset="6912313">But we urge only that the minimum standard ought to be the State or there would be hopeless confusion and more impact upon the First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.766" offset="6971768">Time does not support me and I would like to lean on our brief with respect to due process, but I would like to just point a finger at two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.880" offset="7020251">First, Jenkins was charged with Section 26 2105 which is public indecency and was the only charge in the accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.803" offset="7083990">Then the court below and that charge was approved by the Supreme Court of Georgia or else I wouldn’t raise it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.642" offset="7115337">The court below charged the jury that it could also find him guilty of obscenity which is another section and another crime, 2601, not 2605, and they could also charge him with pandering which is quite preposterous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.204" offset="7173538">There’s not even a word of evidence about that and this case doesn’t fit pandering anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.049" offset="7192973">This isn’t a close case such as Ginsberg where that became an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.806" offset="7215961">And therefore when the jury brought in a general verdict, no one can tell what they found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.288" offset="7245949">In addition to that, the Supreme Court of Georgia construed 2105 which is public indecency together with 2101 which is obscenity, construed them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.857" offset="7304150">They have different penalty provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.859" offset="7312196">They were passed at different times by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.174" offset="7325466">One of them even submits a tax for distributing obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.399" offset="7350335">No one knows which penalty would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.173" offset="7361411">And as construed together, 2101 becomes unconstitutional because it doesn’t meet the standards of this Court and 2105 is unconstitutional because that only applies to conduct and shouldn’t have even been submitted with respect to dissemination of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.377" offset="7446256">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.397" offset="7478335">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.651" offset="7499337">First, I like to, if I may, go back a little further in the chronology of the case to point out that sometime prior to the instant case in a case involving Martin Theaters which you will find on page 66 of the record below, some remark brought to at the same film “Carnal Knowledge” was involved in city of Albany, Georgia which is some approximately four hours drive south of Belanc (ph) and after a hearing in Federal Court, after they bring him out back to State Court, the Martin Theater changed and the District Attorney reached an agreement concerning the film “Carnal Knowledge” and Martin Theater agreed not to show this particular film in Albany Georgia, and this is not an issue where the film “Carnal Knowledge” is just rushed out for the first time in this particular case, but it was in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.398" offset="7734335">This was an issue in the Motion Picture industry in Albany, Georgia sometime prior to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.506" offset="7762756">In the present case, prior to the matter coming up for trial, the Court would notice that there were number of demerits file to the indictment or accusation as such and there were six of these demertis that prior to attacking the accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.508" offset="7846766">At the trial itself the film “Carnal Knowledge” was shown by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.728" offset="7867664">The State rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.606" offset="7875187">There were other evidence presented by the defense in this particular instance of other books and it settled only local market which the Georgia Court disposed off, saying it would not be relevant to judge one by some other particular matter, but there was little else, the only other thing that came in, touching the film “Carnal Knowledge” was the unsworn statement of the defendant stating that this was being shown or had been scheduled to be shown in several places in Georgia and our reference to the fact that it has been acclaimed as one of the particular pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.887" offset="8044251">As we pointed out in our brief under new Georgia law, you can not by the use of an unsworn statement, introduce evidence and make it admissible or appropriate value for the jury to the use of an unsworn statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.239" offset="8101721">There are other means to get this material in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.759" offset="8115827">To bring in any critical reviews, anything that would go to show other facets as to the film “Carnal Knowledge”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.965" offset="8148637">But what the jury had in this case, the jury that had to decide this issue was the film “Carnal Knowledge” and this was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.330" offset="8186044">I think if the Court will look at the record, see this is what they had decided on, not any reviewed by the New York Times or anywhere else --</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.800" offset="8891977">But what I would point out to the Court is that, this is the status of the case as it came up and as it left the Trial Court, then we when we came to the appeal, in the case there were basically two areas that went into -- was gone into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.297" offset="8961985">The first was the six numerous of their -- or acts of the demur filed below, and the only other issues raised in the Georgia Courts were the judge either failed to charge or a charge of error on part of the judge, in fact did charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.915" offset="9044428">In that particular case, the Court will notice that as to demur number one and two, below these were expressively waived in the Georgia Court, as to the demur number six, this was expressively waived in the Georgia Court on page seven and none of the appellant brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.800" offset="9115899">So, what the Court had to forward in the Georgia Court was an attack on the demur or the accusation as such saying that this accusation did not include the particular language of 2101 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.665" offset="9187370">This was the attack in number three and number four, the attack was the fact that the particular accusation did not have -- or the statute which he would base did not have this language contain therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.581" offset="9255079">And the fifth one has been dropped on the basis of the Paris Adult Theatre versus Slaton that this Court decided as to the other picture as to public and non-public place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.116" offset="9305234">This is what was raised in the Court above though was simply the judges’ charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.652" offset="9335327">And the question as to whether or not the accusation, not the statute, but where the accusation should have had this particular language including in the accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.490" offset="9386736">Third is the point that they say that this did not have or the statute which it was based, did not have -- that the accusation was based did not have this language on it, but at the time of the accusation and not the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.898" offset="9448385">The Georgia Courts in applying the Miller decision used the very language of the Miller decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.984" offset="9480673">It stated that, local or State standards, the very -- in fact the very language of this Court in the Miller decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.611" offset="9519229">The local or State standards did not go pass that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.315" offset="9533962">So, the State would argue to the Court in this case that there has never been a constitutional attack on the statute in the lower State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.191" offset="9593522">It has been an attack on the accusation itself and it has not been attack on the statute for being over broad or being vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.931" offset="9628421">Now, an issue was raised in that particular area as I pointed out on the fact that the code section involved did not include the Georgia definition of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.024" offset="9688816">The Court will look at the entire statute section; you will see that it is defined as the distributing obscene materials section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.585" offset="9735105">That in this section 2105 is included and the definition of obscenity is included in the Section 2101 (b) as part of this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.591" offset="9799158">And in 2105, the Georgia Court require that 2011, that means that you have to got to go to the indecent exposure statute to see what the prohibited act will be on indecent exposure, but in this particular section, it requires it and it has to be the distributing of obscene materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.687" offset="9899468">Now, in this area, the Court charged in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.677" offset="9915455">It wasn’t done in the Supreme Court for the first time, the lower court charged the language of all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.504" offset="9950772">It told them that charge would be a crime of distributing obscene material that he was charged for these particular acts and then charged the jury in very explicit language and the Court said that the question is not whether these acts were done as such but, if these acts were in fact done, would this be obscene under this provision of distributing obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.266" offset="10065816">The Court charged him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.433" offset="10070518">There’s not the question is not public indecency or exposure but the question is if these acts that are depicted were done on the screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.963" offset="10108552">Does this taken in the view, the Georgia statute and test on obscenity, does this show that this movie is obscene under those particular standards?</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.927" offset="10160483">In the judges’ ruling, the jury so found but to call the Court's attention first to one point, there was never any enumeration of errors raised in the Georgia Courts on the general grounds that the jury could not have found this particular film obscene, under any standard on the general grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.019" offset="10260793">In Georgia, Courts has liberalized in the last few years, its rules on bringing them out before them, saying that anytime the before oral argument or before the Court decides the issue that any defect in the enumerations area, or the notice to appeal can be upheld in that particular time, and there was never an attack made or any charge made in the Georgia Courts that this film was not obscene, it was never an issue raised in the Georgia Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2614.990" offset="10536751">And the Court, below in the majority opinion, I don’t believe the Court of Georgia has any problem stating the film, where something is, this is obscene, and we find this to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.459" offset="10578547">But in this particular case, the Court says after reviewing the record and reviewing on this Court we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.500" offset="10602789">Holds the record in this case amply supports the verdict of guilty showing that the film “Carnal Knowledge” in violation of distributing obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.741" offset="10639673">And what I am saying in this Court now is this was an issue that has not been raised below in the George Courts by the appellant in the proper manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.238" offset="11025659">Well, I’m little confused too on page 30-31 and rather brief charge which embraces a large part of the relatively brief charge of the Court, at least the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.529" offset="11086890">I note that the word obscene and obscene conduct appears five times at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.789" offset="11123879">I might have missed some, so the judge certainly submitted the issue of obscenity to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.550" offset="11170900">The Georgia rules of the enumeration there that you have to delineate the issues that you are appealing upon for the Court to reach a determination at this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.342" offset="11210083">This issue was not ever raised by any enumeration of error at any time, prior to the Court’s determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.472" offset="11238609">Now if the Court can say that by affirming the jury’s findings in this fact, this does decide the issue of obscenity and that would be this Court’s decision that they did reach that particular point.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2806.475" offset="11302661">But if you look at Justice Jordan’s opinion at pages 53 and 54 of the joint appendix, he says that Trial Court correctly charged this definition of obscenity of the guideline for the jury to apply in this particular case going ahead mentioned the Roth case, Memoirs against Massachusetts, our decision in Miller against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.058" offset="11392940">Whether or not the Supreme Court of Georgia had to pass on that and view it or whatever the bill of exceptions before them was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.883" offset="11416242">It seems to me that they did say that it was constitutionally permissible to find this film obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.105" offset="11493146">But our rule on review is that, even if the Supreme Court of the State might not have had to deal with the thing under its procedure, if it in fact dealt with it, then it’s before us also, at least that’s my understanding.</text>

            <label>Mr. Tony H. Hight</label>
            <text syncTime="2867.313" offset="11546018">Yes sir, in my opinion maybe wrong, but this is what I read in the entire facts in going back to the entire view of the thing is that issues were raised as to the request of charge that the Court had to find them certain evidence, where it was available for the jury to consider on other matters that did not reach the issue of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.607" offset="11639223">Well, if this is wrong then it would be -- if I’m wrong then it would be considered in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.949" offset="11672555">In any case the state below, or the Georgia Supreme Court below stated that as they have done in number of cases as in the Miller versus California case, the test of obscenity is another provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.092" offset="11741100">It’s not in the same provision it would charge with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.387" offset="11754266">A definition section is otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.542" offset="11766909">In Georgia you also have in murder cases, situations as to murder, you have got some other sections that go and limit murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.937" offset="11800451">When you get into question that would justify a homicide which would apply in particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.492" offset="11818736">In this case, the Georgia Court said only that in 2105, since this was on the distributing of obscene materials, the entire code section had to be considered together, which included the definition of obscenity in 2101 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.209" offset="11897626">In that particular probation it just delineated the Georgia Obscenity Test and incorporated that as part of the 2105.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.317" offset="11938064">Now, this is not a new rule and it is not -- it is not something that brought out for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.463" offset="11954573">This has been the same thing for a number of years where they say that they have to consider the entire code section and not just pull out one section, if you are to construe this, it covers the same basic materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.106" offset="12017162">And the Georgia Court consider them together and we urge to the Court that this decides, if the Court did reach the question of obscenity as to 2105, that this does cover that particular material on non-federal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.033" offset="12084872">So, the State Court has so construed and included in the definition of obscenity 2105 and the 2101 (b) together and should solve that particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.708" offset="12143595">The only other thing raised below other that the charge itself, not only as I pointed out before was waived on page seven, they made an issue that the use of the word knowingly in 2102 was not appropriately done and was specifically waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.342" offset="12214126">But in this particular case, if the Court pleases, there was no attack below on the Georgia statute involved here, on the question of over breadth of the particular statute or any vagueness on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.444" offset="12310570">This was not raised before the Georgia Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.389" offset="12322273">There’s nothing in the Georgia Courts’ determination of the case as to vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.941" offset="12356545">Getting into the area of due process, if the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.609" offset="12379220">In this particular area, the Georgia, of course as I pointed out acquiest to the factual situation, this is not something that just simply jumped out at these individual at least onetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.367" offset="12426240">This is something that had been pending in Albany, Georgia for sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.343" offset="12442122">The statute was on the book and the same statute that had been applied previously in the Martin Theater’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.406" offset="12474410">The Georgia Courts and has previously said much before that point is that this, in each case when you got a code section that pertains to the same matter, that you have to construe the entire code section together to reach a determination as to what the contents would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.089" offset="12545149">And the Court recently say that on 2105 and it falls on the area of distributing obscene material applies that the definition that is given in the code section on distributing obscene material would apply in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.538" offset="12610873">And this is what they did in that particular case and it was not an unforeseen or something that would not particularly come out in that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.400" offset="12662387">Going into to several areas, if the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.956" offset="12672522">First, particularly in the area of National Standards as oppose, as to local standards, the only issue raised below as to any type of standard was the question whether the Trial Court erred in charging national versus local standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.624" offset="12743262">There was no issue raised at all anywhere as to a State versus local.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.221" offset="12769593">In the Georgia Court, in the trial court refused to charge national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.336" offset="12794044">The Court did charge in that particular instance, the same community standard that has been the test says, since Memoirs uses the -- in the community that is say local community, they used the same language that has been used throughout most of the nation as to community standard, but it didn’t define that it’s local.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.915" offset="12884428">In this particular instance, the Georgia Court did not reach the issue again because there was no issue raised as to State or local, the Court simply held the Trial Court was correct, when it said that national standards would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.254" offset="12953809">And this is the only issue as to State versus local standards raised below, whereas to local versus national.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.812" offset="12984007">There was nothing that’s raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.871" offset="12996232">I think the thrust of the State’s argument, if the Court please, is basically is that all the points raised here are raised ab initio, before this Court for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.220" offset="13045656">That they were not properly raised below in the State Court, that the State Court did not have the opportunity to pass upon them in the issue they are now raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.534" offset="13090900">The State Court didn’t meet the objection raised in the Local State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.207" offset="13117544">Now, I think if the Court look at the difference in the enumerations of error, in the arguments made below to the State Court and the arguments made at this time at this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.073" offset="13173029">The Court will see there two, entirely different set of arguments and a complete new set of points that are being raised for this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.931" offset="13232483">One further thing I’d like to call to the Court’s attention is the question as to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.410" offset="13258397">We feel that in the Miller case, the Court, for the first time placed the obscenity area in a situation where the jury would make a determination as to standards that judge had found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.696" offset="13315553">To eliminate a lot of review by the jury having a standard that worked very much like your reasonable man theory, where the jury would make a determination in the Court having the opportunity to review if there is a constitutional question involved, the Court then reaching it on that particular case and on those limited number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.113" offset="13417221">We think that the fact that the Court has delineated the fact that local or State standards applies and that the jury has an important part, makes a great step forward in the area of the obscenity cases.</text>
