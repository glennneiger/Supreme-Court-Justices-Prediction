            <label>Mr. E. Richard Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="37.345" offset="226116">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.796" offset="239909">This case is on appeal from a final judgment with the three-judge District Court, one judge dissenting from the southern district of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.593" offset="275122">The issue here involves questions of due process, equal protection, and statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.509" offset="302811">The issue here stated specifically is whether consistent with the statutory and constitutional framework of unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.716" offset="343562">A former or a Federal agency may deny compensation, unemployment compensation to a former Federal probationary employee, solely on the basis of the employing agency’s statement of its reasons for discharging the former employee, without that employee ever being provided with an opportunity for a fair hearing, at which the employee may contest the reasons for which he has been denied unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.823" offset="464039">Stated more simply, the issue is simply is whether unemployment compensation maybe denied without any hearing, at any time on the basic reasons for the denial of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.757" offset="519732">This case arises within the context of the jointly administered State and Federal Unemployment Compensation Program, a program through which the states administer the payment of unemployment compensation to all covered employees, pursuant to various Federal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.479" offset="594651">One of those Federal statutory requirements is the requirement that a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal be provided to all individuals whose claims for compensation are denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.107" offset="649195">This case arises from the appellee’s interpretation of one of the unemployment compensation statutes, a section of the Social Security Act countrified as 5 U.S.C. Section 8506 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="158.576" offset="711053">Pursuant to the appellee’s interpretation of this particular statute, a Federal agency’s ex parte statement of its reasons for discharging a probationary employee are final and conclusive upon the State unemployment compensation agency and accordingly may not be reviewed by the state in the fair hearing, which is provided by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.059" offset="813035">This interpretation should be noted at the outset is directly contrary to the statutory interpretation provided by the case of Smith v. District Unemployment Compensation Board, a case decided more than three years ago by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.001" offset="892761">The appellee’s interpretation, which is at issue in this case, is best illustrated by describing the facts relevant to the denial of compensation to appellant Christian in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.457" offset="942602">Appellant Christian was discharged by her employer, the post office during her probationary period, on the grounds allegedly of having an unsatisfactory attendance record, specifically that she had not reported her absences to her employer during a period, when she was on a restricted sick leave list.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.478" offset="1026612">Well, since appellant Christian was not a permanent employee, she was not eligible for a termination hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.503" offset="1054720">This is not something that is contested in this case at all, we can see she is not eligible for termination hearing and do not seek a termination hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.223" offset="1089620">Similarly however, since she had not resigned her Federal employment, she was not provided with an unemployment compensation fair hearing for purposes of unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.951" offset="1136536">She was however basically eligible for compensation, because she had worked the minimum amount of time and earned a minimum amount of remuneration in order to have her contractual right to unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.406" offset="1190348">The contractual right, which this Court recognized in the case of California Department of Human Resources v. Java at 402 U.S. accordingly, she applied for compensation through a claims examiner at the New York State Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.836" offset="1256072">A claims examiner normally obtains information, both from the claimant and from the former employer and makes an impartial decision on the information that is received relevant to such issues as reasons for termination of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.870" offset="1312183">In this case however, the claims examiner felt himself bound by Federal appellee’s interpretation of the statute at issue here and accordingly, after receiving the ex parte statement of the reasons for discharging appellant Christian, the claims examiner denied compensation to appellant Christian on the grounds of those that ex parte statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.806" offset="1451990">The claims examiner would have obtained information from the State of New York, concerning the reasons for discharge and information from he claimant himself or herself and on the basis of that information, the claims examiner would’ve made a fair determination as to the reasons for discharge for purposes of compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.250" offset="1981753">The hearing referee in this case, after hearing the evidence submitted orally on the issue of termination by appellant Christian and after having received the statement from the post office, submitted in lieu of appearance through the Industrial Commissioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.415" offset="2394384">Before I turn into the due process, and the equal protection, and the statutory construction issues in this case, I’d like to reiterate a couple of points about what this case is about and what it is not about.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.137" offset="2445270">And this is particulary in light of the briefs submitted by the Federal appellees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.147" offset="2465332">The hearing which is sought in this case and which we contend as constitutional and statutorily required is unemployment compensation hearing for purposes unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.547" offset="2514965">The appellants do not seek a termination hearing, they do not seek reemployment, rather all is sought here is a fair determination procedure through a fair hearing for purposes of unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.647" offset="2571285">Now, second the provision of a fair hearing for purposes of unemployment compensation to the appellants here would have no affect whatsoever upon the Federal discharge procedures with regard to probationary employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.319" offset="2630008">It is conceded on the record, indeed the Federal regulations provide and we do not challenge them that a Federal probationary employee maybe discharged without cause, during his probationary period.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.968" offset="2676611">Accordingly, if there maybe a discharge without cause, a subsequent hearing for purposes of unemployment compensation, which merely review the reasons or the lack of reasons for the discharge could have no effect upon the discharge procedures for that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.835" offset="2744111">Now thirdly, the issue here, the unemployment compensation issue at the hearings, the reasons for termination as this Court noted in Java the reasons for termination constitute the most frequently disputed issue in unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.625" offset="2815269">And, as we point out in our brief, note 8 on page 10 more than 60% of the claims in the State of New York that reached the fair hearing referee involved issues concerning reasons for termination, so it is a frequently disputed issue on our employment compensation and this is what is being denied to the appellants here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.125" offset="5861251">And what they did of course is they looked at unemployment compensation generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.551" offset="6082978">Also, what is significant we hinge on the word “finding,” the Congress used the word “findings,” they did not use another word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.356" offset="6114220">This is a contextual word and in the context of unemployment compensation, the word “findings” is very fairly mean, can mean findings after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.034" offset="6152882">Additionally, we looked very strongly to the dominant legislative theme of providing unemployment compensation to Federal employees, that dominant scheme is simply to make employees equal to stay in private employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.193" offset="6221531">Provide them with the same terms and conditions of employment, as provided to other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.528" offset="6246818">So, I should note that this Court need not declare the statute unconstitutional, that the proper statutory construction here does require -- that a hearing be provided to the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.582" offset="6299063">I should also note that this Court of course has reviewed many cases of statutory construction, which it involved questions of due process, where the due process considered an issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.971" offset="7444584">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.696" offset="7455556">Before addressing the constitutional issues that Mr. Larson has discussed, I would like to raise an alternative ground for affirmance, which I think will permit this Court to decide the case without reaching the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.515" offset="7506860">The appellants stand before this Court in this posture, they are attacking the constitutional adequacy of procedures that they have never invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.761" offset="7539775">Under familiar principles requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, their claim should not be entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.898" offset="7564330">To understand why we take this position, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of what the procedures are, that are provided by the regulations and those governing regulations are set out of pages 33 to 38 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.466" offset="7618664">The stage is set for these procedures, of course, when an applicant or unemployment compensation submits an application to a State Unemployment Compensation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.854" offset="7656176">The State Unemployment Compensation Board thereupon seeks information from the Federal employing agency, with respect to the employee service, including most particularly for this case, the reasons for his termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.274" offset="7713855">Now, if a discharged probationary employee, which is what we have in this case, is denied unemployment compensation, because of the stated of reason for his discharge, he has the following procedures available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.340" offset="7762129">First, under section 609.22 of the regulations, which appears at page 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.037" offset="7784908">He may obtain from the employing agency any information he needs relating to the basis for the Federal finding, the Federal finding being the reason stated for his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.733" offset="7827644">Under section 609.8, which is two pages earlier on page 34, the employing agency must furnish this information in writing and I add right here that for appellant Green, if he wished to know who it was who observed him drinking at the time he was observed drinking, he was free to ask the question and get a response in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.809" offset="7915938">Second, under 609.23 which is at the bottom of the page 36, top of page 37, the employee may file a written request for reconsideration and correction of the findings that have been submitted to the state agency and he may submit together without request any information he has to support his request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.900" offset="7996395">Again, referring back to page, the preceding page at 609.9, the agency must consider all the information submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.335" offset="8030041">It must review its findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.902" offset="8036310">It must correct any errors, and at most in affirm, modify, or reverse whatever the findings are affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.397" offset="11142374">I’d like to read you a sentence, the last sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.157" offset="11157420">“The consequence of permitting probationary employers to litigate the reasons for their discharge, are extensively merely to determine their eligibility of unemployment benefits would be to overturn the settle principle that a probationary employee does not have the right to contest the propriety of his discharge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.363" offset="11246237">I take it back then is that the principle that you say is settled and is conceded by your opponent is that a probationary employee maybe discharged even without cause, and with or without a hearing, no hearing as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.791" offset="11315931">And I understand your brief to say that if we decide the case against the government on this issue that this will then become a precedent that will overturn the settled practice with respect to the discharge of probationary employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.077" offset="11389074">Well, I think it’s probably an over statement Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.478" offset="11402658">There is of course, an analytical distinction between a hearing, with respect to the reasons for discharge, as it relates to unemployment compensation and a hearing with respect the validity of a discharged looking towards reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.319" offset="11454067">And, there's no question that they’re separate, but the thrust of the statement, while it may have been an over statement, I think is accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.642" offset="11491265">One of the reasons why a hearing would be inadvisable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.455" offset="11518537">And, one of the reasons why a hearing is not provided, I think is that with respect to probationary employees, there needs to be the greatest amount of flexibility in an effort to weed out before an employee gets tenured status, incompetent and unsuitable employees, because of the importance of having abled people administering the government’s vital programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.903" offset="11608398">Once a man becomes tenured, it’s very difficult to remove them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.713" offset="11627624">And, there are--the whole panoply procedures and just because of that extra protection he gets, it’s necessary that there be a great flexibility at the early stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.931" offset="11664509">Now, a hearing on the reasons for discharge of a probationary employee is going to have an impact on the decisions of supervisor’s make necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.083" offset="11705051">It’s not because the issue is one of reinstatement, but the fact of the matter is that a hearing, the prospect of a hearing is likely to be at deterrent to a supervisor, just because he realized that there's a great deal of manpower that has to go into it, a great deal of preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.396" offset="11762312">His decision in a sense is going to be put on the line, even though there's not going to be an reinstatement that’ll result from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.921" offset="11784464">There is going to be a psychological impact and it will, I think, inhibit the flexibility, that I think is so essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.547" offset="11814975">So, in answer to your question, there is a relationship, though is not an analytically clear one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.420" offset="11870459">Mr. Justice Brennan, I should note to your benefit I think, that the issue turns not on the section that you had read, it turns on Section 8506 of Title 5, which set forth at our brief, at pages 31 and 32.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.646" offset="11963350">That's right, that’s the one that requires the Federal employing agency to respond to a request from a state agency, by giving the findings, as what the word is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.865" offset="11996160">Now, that the issue really turns on whether findings implies a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.494" offset="12018730">It seems to me plain that the findings doesn’t have that implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.712" offset="12039628">What it means here is simply a determination after an inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.664" offset="12055406">It has no implication one way or the other as to the form that inquiry would take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.462" offset="12074632">And, you know when Congress has had a desire to require a hearing, it is not difficult to do so ambiguously and I should mention in the very next section, in 8507, which is not reprinted in the briefs, 8507 deals with the right of a state agency or the secretary of labor to recoup compensation paid to an employee who made a false statement, if he first finds that there has been a false statement made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.020" offset="12184869">Now, what that says is “A finding by a state agency or the secretary maybe made only after an opportunity for a fair hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.902" offset="12216320">In the very next section, using the exact same words, they found it necessary to add only after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.502" offset="12238785">I think that makes it quite clear that congress did not contemplate it, that there necessarily be a hearing preceding the findings that are referred to 8506.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.062" offset="12277029">Mr. Larson is correct in saying that we do not say this is the only possible interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.731" offset="12303673">I think a lot of the policy of unemployment statutes that the appellants set forth in their brief may well give this Court the option if it came to that of reading the statute to require a hearing, if it was necessary to preserve its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.643" offset="12379324">The point is however, that this a reading of the statute by the agency principally responsible for administering it, that we think it’s permissible and that we think ought to be respective, unless there’s a constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.545" offset="12434913">There are really two constitutional issues here, one is a due process issue and one is an equal protection issue and our position is that in neither argument is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.691" offset="12487471">To start with a due process issue, we believe that the due process clause is not even implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.096" offset="12513176">It provides that there no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.499" offset="12534700">There’s no question that the appellants have not been deprived of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.719" offset="12551628">They don’t assert that they’ve been deprived of liberty, and so the question is whether there is a property right at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.376" offset="12574302">Our position is that the property right in unemployment compensation benefits, like the right to continued employment in the Roth case is defined by the rules and understandings, under which the benefit is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.081" offset="12629055">In Roth, the rules and understandings where contained in the terms of the appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.169" offset="12649430">In this case, the rules and understanding are contained within the terms of the statutes in governing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.666" offset="12671373">And, those statutes and governing regulations made clear that the procedures available for correcting errors is the only procedure and that is the only way, one can correct errors that they find are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.797" offset="12719961">So, when one seeks unemployment compensation benefits, one seeks them with the understanding, that if there are errors in the Federal findings, they can be corrected by one method and one method only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.388" offset="12762279">In these circumstance, there is no property right, unless the procedures that are specified have some sense been denied to the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.449" offset="12814524">I can think of one example that might serve to make the point, suppose at Congress enacted a statute granting benefits to victims of crime, provided that the administrator should first find on the basis of an application that has been submitted and on the basis of certified hospital and police records that in fact, the person was injured in the course of a violent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.236" offset="12909714">And, supposed further, that the administrator’s determination were made unreviewable, except that the applicant after a denial of his application, might inquire further of the administrator, as to the further--as the basis of the denial and might seek reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.710" offset="12967602">Now, this is basically what we have here, and I think it’s clear that there would be no due process right, no legitimate entitlement that an applicant who had been injured, who claimed to be have been injured in a course of a violent crime, would have to a due process hearing before the denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.530" offset="13030818">This is because the right, as Congress has to find it, includes only the procedures of Congress has specified.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.665" offset="13539370">And, that the findings needn’t be predicated upon a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.540" offset="13558909">It seems to me quite clear that Congress has made it clear that they’ve defined the right to make with the condition that these findings will be conclusive enough, be open for further litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.005" offset="13616797">I’d like to touch very briefly on the equal protection arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.484" offset="13634664">There has been suggestion that there is a constitutional impermissible discrimination between state employees and private employees who are given full benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.626" offset="13687223">And, between probationary Federal employees who were not given full benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.874" offset="13708225">But again, these statutes had been setup different times, for different purposes and it seems to me our perfectly proper for Congress to draw, to strike a different balance in the context of federally funded benefits, when you’re dealing with Federal employing agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.243" offset="13781682">The Congress might reasonably determine that it was too much of a burden on the Federal government to require it to respond with hearings, in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.822" offset="13816059">And, especially where they are giving us an alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.627" offset="13827239">And, at least on its face, so far as we can tell from this case, an adequate way of correcting the errors might have been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.792" offset="13891918">Yes, it is, shortly after the Smith case was decided the Secretary of Labor amended his regulations to provide that an employee who has resigned, a probationary employee, who has resigned and who disputes the findings of the Federal employing agency may have a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.310" offset="13966002">Now, there is a reason for that too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.035" offset="13976869">In the case of a discharged employee, there is no question as to what the reasons were, I mean it’s within the Federal government’s competence to know what it was in it’s own mind when it discharged an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.235" offset="14021695">When an employee resigns however, for example, if he resigns saying that he resigned, because it was too cold to work in that building, and the fact is from the Federal standpoint that he was resigned three days after he was told he was going to be terminated or might be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.810" offset="14092016">There's no way to resolve definitively what was in the employee’s mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.724" offset="14107690">And, if he wishes to commit in that point and show that what is in his mind is that the room was cold, that’s available to him, under the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.521" offset="14138828">There’s one other, of course, one other distinction that is between the treatment of probationary employees and permanent employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.866" offset="14168189">And, I think that the difference is they’re relate not to the statute, which gives them no permanent employees, no greater rights to hearing, to prevent to the findings are final and conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.027" offset="14208836">But, it relates to their different Civil Service status, they have a right to hearing with respect to their continued tenure and if it turns out after that hearing that the findings needed to be corrected, well the regulations specified that the agency must correct findings if it determines that there was an error within a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.508" offset="14286785">But, the purpose of the hearing is not to challenge the findings for unemployment compensation, but solely to challenge the validity of the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.103" offset="14317192">So again, if there's a distinction between them and in light of all these, we submit that the decision below should be affirmed.</text>
