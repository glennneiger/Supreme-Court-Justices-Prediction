            <text syncTime="9.478" offset="114625">We have granted the writ of certiorari in this case to resolve the conflict in the circuits on whether state trade secret protection is preempted by operation of the federal patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.814" offset="171990">We conclude that until Congress takes affirmative actions of the contrary, the states should be free to grant protection to trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.896" offset="204382">And accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to reinstate the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.867" offset="252238">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in the result; Mr. Justice Douglas with whom Mr. Justice Brennan joined, filed a dissenting opinion; Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the decision of the case.</text>
