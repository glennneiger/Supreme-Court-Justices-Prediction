            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">I have number 73-78, Kahn versus Shevin here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.359" offset="122149">Florida has a statute that grants windows an annual $500 property tax exemption, but it does not extend that exemption to widowers and the appellant is a widower who brought the suit asking for a declaratory judgment and from the Florida Court saying that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.670" offset="251402">The Court held contrary to the claim of the widower and we affirm that judgment finding no invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.005" offset="296751">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined and Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
