            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="81920">We will hear arguments first this morning in 73-157, Calero-Toledo against Pearson Yacht Leasing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.705" offset="144718">Mr. Coleman, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lynn R. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="18.634" offset="156421">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.074" offset="166139">My name is Lynn Coleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.514" offset="171886">I appear as special counsel for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, both of the appellants in this case being officials of the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.015" offset="205949">This is an appeal from a decision by the District Court of Puerto Rico sitting as a three-judge Court which declared unconstitutional a portion of the Controlled Substances Act of the Commonwealth as well as the uniform seizure and forfeiture statute of the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.969" offset="289750">The ground for this decision was that these provisions were unconstitutional on their face in that they fail to provide for notice and an opportunity for hearing prior to a seizure in connection with a forfeiture proceeding and that, from a substantive standpoint, they provided for the taking of the property of a person who was innocent of the crime for which the property was seized and the court in so holding rely them to fairly recent decisions of this case of this case -- this Court, Fuentes versus Shevin, and Coin and Currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.090" offset="482220">The particular brief statement of the facts involved would be that Pearson Yacht Leasing Company leased a yacht to a man named Olson which, in our brief, we referred to as the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.795" offset="541048">The lease is, in many respects, familiar to -- similar to a conditional sale in that the lessee would enjoy full possession of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.471" offset="595801">The lease was for a five-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.143" offset="606459">The lessee had the obligation to pay rent, that obligation would not cease in the event anything happened to the boat specifically indicating that forfeiture would be one of the events which would not interrupt the lessee’s obligation to pay rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.770" offset="688901">The lessee had to insure the interest of the lessor against all eventualities.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.491" offset="711784">The lessee was obliged to use the boat only for lawful purposes and alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.108" offset="734250">It contained provisions which you would expect to find in a conditional sale contract or in a conventional mortgage if the seller of products had elected to allow his vendee to take title and, instead, reserve a purely security interest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="180.730" stopTime="200.189">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="180.730" offset="804780">Are you suggesting, Mr. Coleman, that if there were a mortgage -- if there’d been a full transfer and a mortgage back, that is the title had passed and the mortgage back, that this forfeiture would then wipe out the underlying security?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lynn_r_coleman" startTime="200.189" stopTime="235.779">
            <label>Mr. Lynn R. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="200.189" offset="882625">I don’t know that it would have in this case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.445" offset="891611">The court below treated the lessor as if he were the owner of the vessel and really did not examine the kind of a case which you would have where you have parties, both of them have some interest in the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.358" offset="963291">I think that the effect of the Puerto Rican statute and many other statutes, both of the United States and other states, could be to -- in a forfeiture proceeding, to forfeit effectively the interest of the mortgagor.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="241.861" offset="1049287">So it’s virtually indistinguishable from a conditional sale?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lynn R. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="244.759" offset="1060885">I think that’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.650" offset="1076454">In any event, the lessee was found in possession of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.444" offset="1099651">Presumably, he was arrested in criminal proceedings instituted against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.732" offset="1116787">Some time after that discovery of marijuana on the vessel, it was seized pursuant to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.516" offset="1147925">The statute operates in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.464" offset="1155762">There must be a determination by a high governmental official, either the Superintendent of Police for the entire island, the Attorney General of the Department or the Secretary of Treasury in Puerto Rico that there has been an offense for which the property becomes forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.691" offset="1236637">The offense is described in the Controlled Substances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.163" offset="1250534">Process is issued by such officer and pursuant to that, the vessel is seized without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.238" offset="1274776">Within 15 days -- I mean, immediately notice is to be given, within -- and the -- it’s to be given to all owners, all persons who are known to have an interest, within 15 days, they can challenge the seizure and forfeiture by instituting proceedings in the Commonwealth Courts. The lessee was notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.573" offset="1360144">He was on record with the Puerto Rican authorities as the owner of the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.765" offset="1384908">The Puerto Rican authorities presumably had no knowledge of the lessor’s interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.466" offset="1403716">The lessor consequently was not notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.209" offset="1414687">He did not discover the seizure and forfeiture of the vessel until some months later when it elected to sue in Federal Court rather than in the Commonwealth Courts pursuant to the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="345.201" stopTime="356.743">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="345.201" offset="1462648">Under the Puerto Rican statute, could someone having a property interest in the vessel who was not in possession of it have registered under this Puerto Rican statute and then been notified at the time of the forfeiture?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lynn_r_coleman" startTime="356.743" stopTime="496.202">
            <label>Mr. Lynn R. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="356.743" offset="1508833">I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.545" offset="1512072">I think the -- that registration statute, the form which there is registration, provides for other owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.270" offset="1562958">The record is really silent on that though, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.551" offset="1580095">Before proceeding to the burden of my argument, I would like to mention one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.504" offset="1603918">The Solicitor General filed a brief in this case, which I think is very excellent help for brief this past Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.989" offset="1629832">It particularly places in perspective the impact of an affirmance of this decision on a number of federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.850" offset="1661283">There is one thing that we -- I would call attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.305" offset="1675076">On page 5 of the Solicitor’s brief in a footnote, it is stated that the statutes involved were challenged as violating both the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.028" offset="1741949">The court below, in its holding, made no distinction whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.394" offset="1755429">They based it on due process of law and a concept of taking without just compensation without specifying either the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.778" offset="1800986">The Solicitor then says it has been held that, to the extent the constitution applies directly to the laws of Puerto Rico, they are subject to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.523" offset="1835990">A 1947 decision of the First Circuit is cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.768" offset="1856888">That case does hold then that that, of course, was before the Commonwealth was created in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.535" offset="1884056">We suggest that that makes a substantial difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.687" offset="1900565">Since the creation of the Commonwealth, the First Circuit has consistently declined to decide that question as to whether the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.174" offset="1938599">So has this Court in the only other case to come directly from the Commonwealth to this Court, that being the Fornaris case which was decided about three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.911" offset="1989486">The Commonwealth did not brief this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.160" offset="1998472">We do not regard as essential to a determination in this case whether the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment due process is applicable to the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.516" offset="2039954">It has been true and accepted for many years that due process fully applies in the Commonwealth.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.018" offset="3885976">That’s why the case is very important to the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.177" offset="3894544">The uniform seizure and forfeiture statute brought together all of the seizure and forfeiture provisions in disparate parts of Puerto Rican Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.223" offset="3934772">And declaring this statute, on its face, unconstitutional just puts an end to seizure and forfeiture proceedings, I think, is a practical matter in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.802" offset="3973120">If you have to have notice before you can seize property, in connection with a criminal matter in leading to a forfeiture proceeding, the seizure statutes, I believe, are going to be -- have their practicality seriously impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.623" offset="4044382">But, in Fuentes versus Shevin, this Court struck down the Pennsylvania in Florida prejudgment replevin statutes, a ground that they authorized the taking of property, even though for a short period of time, without opportunity for notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.767" offset="4128914">There, the creditor could invoke process of the state to retrieve property in the possession of another private person solely on the basis of his own affidavit, solely on the basis of an ex parte proceeding before the clerk of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.990" offset="4201848">The court carefully distinguished other situations where seizure without a prior hearing was justifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.609" offset="4244271">It also carefully distinguished seizure pursuant to a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.319" offset="4267154">In our view, seizure under this statute where there must be a determination by a responsible official, where there must be processed issue is very similar to seizure under a warrant, though not the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.939" offset="4333610">And, in Fuentes, the Court identified three criteria which have generally been used to describe those areas where there could be seizure in advance of a hearing and that is, is there an important governmental interest served, was the first criteria and I think that, clearly is satisfied by seizure statute looking to a forfeiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.817" offset="4693159">The third was that there’d be no abdication of state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.163" offset="4710504">In Fuentes, state power could be invoked solely by private persons for private gain without any determination whatsoever of a -- is probably correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.055" offset="4762122">Here, however, there is a determination by a high government official that an offense has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.355" offset="4799321">The property has been used in connection with a crime and the process must be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.586" offset="4816248">We think that this case is clearly within the guidelines expressed by Fuentes which would justify a seizure without prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.029" offset="4862015">We think this case -- this Court’s decision in 1971 in U.S. versus Thirty-seven Photographs would also clearly justify a seizure prior to hearing in connection with a forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.532" offset="4927948">So, our conclusion is that that part of the court’s decision was clearly an error.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.489" offset="5183843">First, as I mentioned a moment ago, there is again a standing question because Pearson elected not to avail himself of the opportunity presented by the Puerto Rican law to within 15 days of notice, be that pursuant to the statute or after actual notice, to go to court and assert his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.356" offset="5271301">We also believe that if they think that it was crucial to their rights that they’d be able to show that they were innocent of the crime and that that defeat the forfeiture, that that would be a question which certainly could be litigated in the Puerto Rican courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.296" offset="5335040">The statute does not say you can take the property of one innocent of the crime, the statute is silent on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.192" offset="5542661">No, but my primary argument of course, Your Honor, it would be a wrong construction should the court view the constitutional requirements as being such, that this defense must be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.042" offset="5598041">I think that there is that, under the principles of construing a statute to preserve its constitutionality they would’ve been required to take a look at the statue and they wouldn’t of necessity have to abide by that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.939" offset="5669616">There was an argument earlier in this case that the District Court should have abstained to allow the court, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, to past first of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.035" offset="5726041">The Commonwealth withdrew its objection to the calling of the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.282" offset="5758955">We are not here arguing that abstention was required, but I think that there was a duty on the court to attempt to save constitutionality of the statute if it thought it necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.763" offset="5824888">But, on the merits of the Coin and Currency question, we do not think that Coin and Currency reached this question at all. Justice Harlan there did say that there could be a question under Fifth Amendment whether a statute authorizing the taking of one innocent of the crime could be squared constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.086" offset="5922168">He said it is not necessary to decide that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.890" offset="5937424">There was specifically no overruling of the many decisions of this Court which in the past have upheld that kind of a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.428" offset="5983608">Certainly, it’s true that, early on, a forfeiture of one who had entrusted his property to one who then committed a crime was justified on the ground, in which this Court has regarded as fictional, that the property was the offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.042" offset="6045989">Now, I think though that there’s some significant justification in terms of current realities that are very closely related to that fiction, that is, if that the state needs to be able to attack in effect the capital goods of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.308" offset="6115056">In a smuggling operation, for example, the airplane, the vessel, or the truck or whatever may it be far more important and the individual driving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.549" offset="6152046">And, if -- and it’s an effective tool to be able to reach that vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.257" offset="6186945">Now, there’s hardly any vehicle in the United States that is not subject to some outstanding security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.329" offset="6223203">If the state -- if forfeiture of this vessel can be defeated by undisclosed outstanding security interest, then I think that the forfeiture statute’s effectiveness would be seriously impaired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.648" offset="6308467">They anticipated the risk of forfeiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.937" offset="9681607">Appellants have emphasized the need of forfeiture as an element of law enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.228" offset="9842730">Now, where seizure is contemporaneous with an otherwise lawful arrest, the objectives of deterrence are obtained and it is constitutionally defensible so long as the defense of innocence is allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2464.769" offset="9940950">On the other hand, where seizure and forfeiture is remote in time from the arrest, no objective other than the imposition of a penalty upon an innocent person is attained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.357" offset="12191347">Now, I would only make one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.451" offset="12207647">Appellees have suggested that what we are contending is that the Fourth Amendment probable cause requirement applies to seizure and then they go from that to say that “Well, you should have a warrant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.092" offset="12262191">Your Honor, that is a misstatement of our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.844" offset="12277238">We say that the statute here, the way it operates, has built into it protections which are very similar to a determination of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.407" offset="12323527">If probable cause is required, we think that the statute and the way it was complied with satisfies it, but we do not think that there’s any question of a warrant being acquired, something over and above what the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.024" offset="12377966">And this Court’s decision in Cooper versus California which was cited with approval in this past term’s decision in Cady versus Dombrowski, I think, makes that crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.565" offset="12432091">With respect to the argument that why can making the property of one who’s innocent of a crime be helpful in law enforcement, I think that it’s self-evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.506" offset="12487889">This Court in the Goldsmith case which has not been overruled said that the theory of the law is you interpose the care of the person who entrusts his property in aid and law of law enforcement, particularly when you’re talking about people who are selling property or lending money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.251" offset="12562913">They have the ability to protect themselves against that risk and then if that risk is there, they also have the motive to try to see that their property is not used in violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.739" offset="12608784">That is a justification for this.</text>
