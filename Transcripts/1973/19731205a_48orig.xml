            <text syncTime="15.981" offset="167267">The State of Mississippi has filed this original action asking the Court to make a judicial determination of a disputed boundary line between the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.362" offset="212825">The uncertainty of the boundary line is due to the fact that it is located in an abandoned Bend of the Mississippi River but formerly was a boundary but which is now been cut-off by the action of the U.S. Engineers in making a neck cut-off in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.373" offset="288893">When the two states were admitted to the union, the Acts admitting the union made the Mississippi River the common boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.508" offset="325360">In the area in question, the river loop westward and southward and then eastward around a long neck of land which was located in Mississippi known as Carter Point, Mississippi and this map have depicted in the Arkansas-Mississippi Refuge Quadrangle was attached to the Special Master’s Report, the Honorable Clifford O'Sullivan.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.751" offset="510412">It is the contention of Mississippi that from about 1823 to 1830, the time of the original G.L.O. surveys that the river migrated slowly and imperceptibly caving in to the Arkansas bank and adding accretions to Carter Point, Mississippi until such time as it moved approximately 2,000 feet to the west, in the location in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.214" offset="632247">In the year 1935, the United States Engineers made a cut-off across the neck of Carter Point which is shown on this exhibit, appendix A, thus, diverting the flow of the river from its old channel around the Carter Point and creating a new channel within a matter of some three months, all navigation left the over -- old channel and adopted the new channel through Tarpley Point.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.598" offset="821791">Its -- by now it has probably close to thousand acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.809" offset="842585">All of this land shown in Spanish Moss Bend has filled in.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.730" offset="862333">There have been numerous problems in the enforcement of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.111" offset="883858">The State of Mississippi arresting residents of the State of Arkansas on this Bar where the intended confusion about which state has criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.242" offset="936312">It is the contention of the State of Arkansas that this gradual migration did not occur but that in the year 1872, the river, Mississippi River suddenly jumped, caved into the Arkansas bank, went over bank, scout out a completely new channel behind the mainland of Arkansas bank and then re-entered the Mississippi channel at a lower area there thus, creating a island which they is Luna Island and not Luna Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.594" offset="1081762">The Special Chancellor, I mean the Special Master resolved this conflict in favor of Mississippi and we are here today on exceptions to his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.149" offset="1135992">We’re not sure just what the position of the Supreme Court is at this time about the weight to be given or the finality to be given to the finding of a Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.167" offset="1180087">We do note that in Rule 9 (2) of the Supreme Court rules at -- they say that where applicable, the Federal Civil Rules will be given effect and in Rule 53 of the Civil Rules, it is provided that the finding -- factual findings of a Master will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.332" offset="1272665">Actually, we are in agreement with Mississippi and Arkansas in agreement with the basic law which is the law of the thalweg and we’re really here arguing a point of fact as to whether the finding of the -- the report of the Master should be approved on that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.500" offset="1353331">We both agree that the law is that if the river migrates slowly and imperceptibly and the thalweg continues to cave in to a bank, that that -- where that thalweg is the boundary line between states that that changes -- does not change the state boundary but the boundary follows the deepest line of navigation of sailing line or thalweg used interchangeably and it remains the state line wherever it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.958" offset="1475166">We agree on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.914" offset="1479032">We further agree that if the river suddenly abandons its old bed and carves out a new bed by -- in a very short period of time by an avulsive action that this freezes the state line and the line of navigation, the sailing channel where it was located prior to the avulsion after that reach of the river has ceased to be a flowing stream.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.581" offset="1617690">The application of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.893" offset="1626990">There's one other point of law which, I think, we are in agreement on and that is this that in the brief below, Arkansas conceded that Mississippi had made a prima facie case and that the burden of proof rested upon them to establish the 1872 avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.830" offset="1710686">This was quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.832" offset="1714657">I did not argue it in my brief because it was quoted by Justice -- by the Special Master and was not controverted by Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.019" offset="1747466">That is the law anyway as I understand it to be because an avulsion is an extraordinary thing and not the ordinary thing that would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.667" offset="1798040">Fortunately, we were able to find numerous maps and charts, direction for navigation, reports to Congress involving this sector of the river over some approximately 200 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.119" offset="1871809">So we have a rarely com -- a fairly complete historical picture of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.713" offset="1898245">From the time that Mississippi and Arkansas were admitted to the union, there are numbers of maps particularly the all western palette which was -- gave directions to navigators and which included maps of this sector of the river which stated that the sailing vessels when they go through Spanish Moss Bend should go over and hold hard against the bed -- against the bank of the Mississippi River thus fixing the sailing line against the concave, hard bank of the Arkansas River from 1820 up until 1860.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.541" offset="2049546">There's not -- the largest years in gap in this period of time was only nine years, so we have a graphic depiction of the fact that from 1820 to 1860, there seems to be no question but what the sailing line, the thalweg, the channel of navigation was hard against the Arkansas bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.005" offset="2135437">Also, during that time, there was no evidence of a detached bar as we call it, a piont bar, an island as Arkansas call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.958" offset="2179218">There was no evidence of any detached land mass appearing of Carter Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.716" offset="2210252">The maps all, however, did show that attached to Carter Point there was building and continued to build a sandbar, accretion formation.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.294" offset="2264586">And in 1863, and we now move into the war years, a law, it's 1863 on the Mississippi River which was drawn up for the purpose of showing this very thing, islands, sandbags, further fortifications and land -- and mines that had been placed out -- was printed and this 1863 map goes into great detail showing a very decided sandbar formation attached to the distal end of Carter Point, Mississippi with no land mass formation out in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.528" offset="2441488">Following the end of the Civil War and doing the efforts to reconstruct the South, the United States sent a -- General Humphreys down to make a -- an inspection and report, particularly on the condition of the levees along the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.056" offset="2527587">The levee being as you know an earth and bank mud that is thrown up at that time parallel within quite close to the bank line for the purpose of trying to contain the Mississippi waters when it was in (Voice Overlap).</text>
            <text syncTime="621.309" offset="2588609">This report that Mr. -- that General Humphreys made in 1866 to Congress and a subsequent report that he made to Congress in 1869 reported that the bank was caving badly in this Bend that the levees had fallen into a state of disrepair and that breaks were evident in the levees in several places, all in this Spanish Moss Bend area.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.995" offset="2707310">Then in 1872, the State of Arkansas also became concerned with this and they appointed a surveyor named Douglas, to make surveys of the existing levees and to make recommendations for new levees to take the place of the gaps into old levees.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.123" offset="2783901">This is a first historical proof of the existence of this land mass known as Luna Bar in a situation where it has become detached from Carter Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.865" offset="2838862">Mr. Douglas surveyed a -- in great detail the Arkansas bank there.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.131" offset="2867911">He showed farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.031" offset="2871463">He showed forests.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.958" offset="2875225">He showed sloughs.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.983" offset="2879300">He showed the levees in place and levees which had been breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.155" offset="2899989">Luna Bar, he did not designate its sect but in the river over against the Mississippi shore, he showed and I -- a formation detached from the shore utterly devoid of any sculptural symbolization which would indicate, we have no report of Mr. Douglas, but it was slightly indicate by leaving it blank that he did not consider it a part of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.421" offset="3001031">The most important thing about Douglas’ survey however, is the fact that he locates with great detail the then existing levee system with its breaks which coincide exactly to the reports that General Humphreys made through Congress in 1866 and 1869.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.229" offset="3080338">And the engineering witnesses introduced by -- the engineering witness and it was only engineering witness introduced by Mississippi was able to overlay subsequent surveys right up to the present time and you can see that all the levee’s prior to 1860 in place, you can walk them both sides considered they’re there.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.074" offset="3167692">You can walk them along the bank, on the Arkansas side.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.950" offset="3187127">There is no levee formation or whatsoever on Luna Bar which is some 2,000 the crest of it is some 2,000 feet to the east.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.813" offset="4074663">There’s the question of criminal jurisdiction and recently there has been a good bid of all activity in Washington County which is immediately adjacent to that, has always been a good bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.774" offset="4122520">In Arkansas, I’m not quite sure about this particular county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.449" offset="4149164">But in any rate, the Douglas 1872 survey was the first historical evidence of this situation being there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.998" offset="4203395">Also in 1872, Louisiana since they were getting the water when the water flowed through the breached levees in Arkansas, they flowed downstream and came in to what is known as the tinsel bottom and Louisiana also sent, a Captain Richardson (ph) up to make an investigation and report and he made a report in 1872 to the Louisiana Levee Commissioner reiterating the same situation found in Humphreys’ reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.285" offset="4328469">In addition to the breaks that he found and shown on Douglas’ Report, he found an additional break of 200 feet in the levee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.627" offset="4357831">The important thing about all of these reports, it seems to me is this, one, no mention was ever made of an avulsion taking place in 1872 whereby the river jumped into Arkansas and caved through the land and came back out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.911" offset="4442990">The geological witnesses, Dr. Kolb, from Mississippi, Dr. -- Mr. Spillers (ph) and Doctor Durham from Louisiana all conceded that in there experience as geologist and all of the geological literature there had never been any mention or ever has any history of any such phenomenon taking place as Arkansas claims to have happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.740" offset="4562317">In fact Dr. Kolb said, I had to coin the phrase and he called it an outside avulsion and said, I never heard of it, I just made it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.273" offset="4596485">Mr. Spillers made one, he said it’s -- I call it reoccupying an old channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.114" offset="4619786">He admitted that there was no such accepted phrase in geologic literature and he said he had to coin the phrase too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.003" offset="4651342">So, with all of these weighed down in this particular narrow sector of the river it is -- it seems to be incredible that if this phenomenon took place, it has never happened before and it never happened since -- but they were concerned with the integrity of the levees when they were concerned with trying to protect the backland of Arkansas from flooding that they would've swept this remarkable situation under the road.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.009" offset="5203362">But the complete refutation of that in our opinion is this that the witness, Smith, the all -- all of these maps were blown up to a common scale, one foot equal 20,000 feet, one to 20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.256" offset="5268355">It’s possible by getting your benchmarks, your levees and so on and lining them up to overlay and -- transparent overlay is made of all these exhibits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.492" offset="5409311">So between 1894 and 1970, when Mr. Putnam went on to Luna Bar there had been a filling so that the elevation had been increased from 1894 as laymen, I’d say fill, it had been filled in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.872" offset="5466885">The elevation had been increased as much as 20 feet, 15 feet, 10 feet, so these stumps were -- they would've hanging in the air if they had been there in 1894.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.915" offset="5515055">In the meantime, the river had come in and deposited and these stumps had obviously floated in, a phenomenon that’s accepted up and down the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.101" offset="6343764">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.809" offset="6358601">The State of Arkansas will agree with the State of Mississippi on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.760" offset="6378454">Apparently, there is no contest of the law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.687" offset="6394128">It will be merely a fact -- factual situation that if Luna Bar or Luna Island is the product of an accretion then of course the evidence is that the river and the thalweg was west of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.792" offset="6454523">If it however did not imperceptibly move, then the theory of the State of Mississippi and it being in the State Mississippi would be incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.134" offset="6495901">To go a little further, the State of Arkansas conceded that in its inception that the State of Mississippi raised a prima facie presumption that the river did migrate, it did not concede that the river did in fact migrate across.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.978" offset="6571238">By the testimony of Mr. Kolb -- Dr. Kolb and the witnesses for the State of Mississippi, we conceded that they raised the prima facie presumption that under normal circumstances and accepted principles there is a westward migration of the river and had been way of this type, however, in the accepted situation, we do not necessarily agree it occurred at that time, in fact we think the evidence is quite contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.454" offset="6709164">We agree that there are many recorded maps and one particular map of -- was -- the defendant’s exhibit number 8 which was a map of the -- I meant, ownership map of Washington County, Mississippi in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.029" offset="6783457">This map does not bear out the contention of the State of Mississippi in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.554" offset="6809579">Appendix -- the map of 1863, Lloyd’s map, and I believe it’s the 9th exhibit in Judge O’Sullivan’s report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.469" offset="6861197">There is an accretion to the northern side of Carter Point but this is not the location of Luna Bar or Luna Island, it is to the north and completely distant by two to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.337" offset="6924727">The -- had the rift in 1971 all of the maps and we commenced with the Government Land Office Survey of 1823 on the Arkansas bank, 1830 on the Mississippi bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.875" offset="6990869">From those points on there is no divided channel in Spanish Moss Bend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.310" offset="7012603">This goes through the Humphreys and map 1861 which was the general reconnaissance map used by General Grant in the conquest of Vicksburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.832" offset="7070699">There is no divided channel all the way through in 1871 based upon the maps from the Library of Congress and the Senate and the other maps and also the defendant’s exhibit number 8 of Washington County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.821" offset="7134647">In 1872, there is a divided channel apparently based upon the maps of Mr. E. A. Douglas who was apparently commissioned to show the breaches in the levee and to get congressional assistance in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.118" offset="7203819">Immediately, west of Luna Bar, there is about a mile or so of levee that are breached, the report of Mr. -- of General Humphreys is that this levee was breached there but the waters were not going to the tinsel bottoms but were passing back to the main channel of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.202" offset="7280201">Mr. Smith, in behalf of the State of Mississippi, deduced that the caving in the bank above Columbia was in Spanish Moss Bend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.205" offset="7324191">The history of pre-Columbia was the first county seat of Chicot County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.370" offset="7340805">It did in fact washed into the river and caved away and the county seat was subsequently was afterward removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.423" offset="7369017">Columbia no longer exists even in any way because it all went into the river and its some several miles south of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.145" offset="7403917">Be that as it may, in 1872, the map of Mr. Douglas, if we will take the -- and assume that the projectile like, the little marking over there is the Mississippi bank or is Luna Bar would be its first appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.934" offset="7471104">However in 1873, there isn’t any question as to the appearance of Luna Bar or Luna Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.987" offset="7503287">Major Sutter (ph), commissioned by Congress made a quick reconnaissance of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.957" offset="7531186">He was making this reconnaissance due to the vast flood damage and to make a report to Congress for assistance therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.190" offset="7564100">Major Sutter in his map of reconnaissance which would be defendant’s exhibit number 12 clearly set forth a bar in the river, he clearly wrote legend, Spanish Moss Bend in the eastward channel and shows the thalweg of the river in the western channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.909" offset="7658977">And going through his entire report he meticulously has put the legend of the name of the Bend even when crowded for space where it apparently originally was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.421" offset="7769004">So we know that the island came into existence in 1872.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.507" offset="7789380">The first hydrographic survey of the river took place in 1879-82, the actual geological survey -- of the surveying and it all took place in ‘71.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.249" offset="7836400">The map and it’s -- whatever they’ll show in their own continued on through ‘82.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.312" offset="7860642">And at that point, it shows a divided channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.411" offset="7872972">The Court’s attention is called to the testimony of Dr. Kolb and Mr. Smith and particularly so, sir with reference to the elevations of the island, Mr. Gar (ph) had made a survey line across the island which crosses the north side and is clearly in an accretion area, reference line A to B, C and I believe it goes to D on up to Carter Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.711" offset="7982268">All of the elevations alluded to by Dr. Kolb and Mr. Smith were based upon the elevations of that reference line and not to the highest recorded elevations of the island itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.039" offset="8035558">If the Court please, the Court to locate exhibit number -- I believe its appendix A to the Master’s report will note that the original survey lines of 1823 on the Arkansas bank, 1830, the Mississippi bank are shown therein with heavy pencil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.249" offset="8116328">At the distal south, distal end is the island itself, the accretions being the portion to the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.145" offset="8143914">The reference line crossed over on to the northern portion of the island and not through the higher area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.145" offset="8187904">Based upon the physical maps and what the -- it thoroughly show, there was no accretion to the distal end of Carter Point, exhibit D-A -- 8, ownership of Washington County completely shows Carter point in its original position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.300" offset="8264600">The other exhibits that are made about that time also can reach that same conclusion and therefore we know that the island did come into existence in the year 1872 based upon Mr. Douglas’ map followed by Major Sutter’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.081" offset="8343698">The -- thereafter there is a divided channel at old time but every Mississippi River Commissions Survey from 1880, the first all the way through to the present time, there is a divided channel around the island.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.122" offset="9319842">This is in the western channel and not on the island itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.901" offset="9338964">On the island itself, in the higher elevation which will be in that south central part on exhibit, appendix A, the high elevation that is recorded much higher than is shown by the State of Mississippi, there are tree stumps of antiquity there or ancient that were located by Mr. Putnam, who is now deceased and Mr. Campson (ph) both experienced foresters, both testified these stumps are from the trees that grew in that spot, they examined them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.745" offset="9486399">The carbon dating of that stump, by Dr. Iddings (ph) which was the tree had been dead -- at the time of its death was 550 years plus or minus 180.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.963" offset="9551182">As I understand the carbon dating, the longer the half-life is computed the smaller the figure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.994" offset="9619310">It was not run any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.971" offset="9631222">This particular tree was the red mulberry stump, sir that was 84 years old by ring count at the time of its death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.641" offset="9665912">Even without the carbon dating, we know that from the surveys thereafter the 1882 survey the -- the tree mass was there gone and this tree if growing there had been dead at least by that time which was prior to the clever man’s survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.146" offset="9747937">The other two of those trees: one, a red mulberry and the other a black walnut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.521" offset="9769462">The black walnut was flagged and left in place by Mr. Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.833" offset="9794748">The ring count they are on was 112 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.060" offset="9807600">There was no attempt to carbon date yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.567" offset="9817631">It also had been dead longer than the period of time involved and was of age there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.272" offset="9852426">The other was the red mulberry with 112 years old or some back at the, exactly, I do not recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.170" offset="9892028">Had the river moved imperceptibly westward as contended by the presumption raised by the State of Mississippi, these stumps could not have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.647" offset="9938004">Further, we have the testimony of Mr. Richard Proctor, who is an elderly man that I have known all of my life since I was born and raised between two miles of this part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.744" offset="9982307">Mr. Proctor testified and if you’ll notice his testimony in came it as not solicited but a voluntary thing, that on this island, he was asked a question and he remembered going upon the island and going into a cistern and taking a mink.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.047" offset="10063600">We further have the testimony of Dr. -- I’m sorry his name escapes me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.029" offset="10487515">The -- not the tree itself and the present living tree and its age but the complete variety of trees that are now growing there is inconsistent with trees with newly formed lands as contended by the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.791" offset="10570585">The Mississippi River Commission itself in the historical study for the Tarpley Cut-off made a survey, a historical study which is defendant’s exhibit number 32 wherein the State of Mississi -- the Mississippi River Commission itself made the historical study and a map showing the accretions and whatnot from 1880 to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.403" offset="10697017">There -- historical study also does not support the presumption of the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.465" offset="10729200">Further, Dr. Fisk in the geological investigation of a Mississippi River alluvial valley and its ancient courses from Cape Girardeau, Missouri to Downing, Missouri, which was defendant’s exhibit number 30, completely supports the contention of the State of Arkansas, completely supports Dr. Durham and Mr. Spillers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.112" offset="10839855">It completely negates the presumption of the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.894" offset="10866918">In its geological investigation, Dr. Fisk shows the area of the island we were just discussing with the secondary and the primary trees they’re on as ancient course number 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.111" offset="10927835">In the hierarchy of the years on the ancient courses, they fixed them by centuries, tenth century, eleventh, and twelfth up to the present time, however, they go back to antiquity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.284" offset="10984469">Dr. Fisk also shows that the higher elevation from which the red mulberry, the walnut and all this others were taken as well as the tight forestation as to be in channel number 10 or in existence more than several hundred of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.939" offset="11067120">We have the defendant’s exhibit number 39 which is a county map of Chicot County prepared by Mr. W. A. Miller (ph), who at that time was the County surveyor who shows clearly the Luna Island Bar area as being it in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.368" offset="11152802">It’s the contention of the State of Arkansas that the report by Honorable Judge -- Mr. Judge O’Sullivan is erroneous in that it adopts the depth or the elevation theory of the State of Mississippi on a reference line was aren’t regard to the true elevation of the island from where the physical facts of antiquity were discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.007" offset="11271398">Secondly, the map area does not support the contentions in anyway and in fact negates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.697" offset="11306193">We believe that the State of Arkansas has completely negated the presumption raised by Dr. Kolb or by Mr. Smith with physical factual evidence that makes the fact that this would be a part of Mississippi in impossibility.</text>
