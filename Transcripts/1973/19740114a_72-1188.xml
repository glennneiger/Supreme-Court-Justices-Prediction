            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments next to 72-1188 Schlesinger against Reservists Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.496" offset="270733">Mr. Solicitor General you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.187" offset="281496">Let me say at the outset that I'm not sure just what considerations impelled us to enlarge the time to an hour and a half here.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.580" offset="315037">I want to assure both counsel that there will be no penalty impose if you find yourself to one hour, total half hour each or something near that.</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="71.714" stopTime="346.834">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="71.714" offset="363624">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.280" offset="377835">I will try to please the Court in just a regard if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.154" offset="389329">This was a suit brought by the respondents, The Reservists Committee to Stop the War in several named members of the military reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.648" offset="415347">In order to compel the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries in the Army, Navy and Air Force, to remove active -- remove Congressmen now in office from the military reserves and to reclaim paying for other remedies not now in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.635" offset="487340">The theory of the case is that the Article I, Section 6, Clause 2, which the second half that Clause which states “No Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."</text>
            <text syncTime="123.437" offset="570514">Clearly the case is, that Clause places an obligation upon the Executive Branch enforceable by the courts to purge from the reserve ranks all Congressmen and then in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.955" offset="624536">The Courts of Appeals held for the plaintiffs the respondents here in a summary judgment denying the government summary judgment and issue the declaratory judgment only.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.284" offset="665913">The court -- I am sorry -- the District Court did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.180" offset="673437">The Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion except for one remark concerning standing which we will come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.170" offset="697469">The Government will urge reversal hereupon each of three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.066" offset="713038">We will urge that under first that under no theory of standing have these respondents standing to maintain this action either as taxpayers or as citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.046" offset="748983">We will argue second that the question of whether a Reserve commission is an office that disqualifies it's holder from membership in Congress is an issue of qualification for membership of Congress and therefore by Article I, Section 5, Clause 1, is committed to the exclusive determination of the House in which the member sets it is a political question and therefore, nonjusticiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.940" offset="856503">We will contend finally that membership in the Reserves particularly of the type involved here is under no -- is under no construction of the word “office” and “office” within the meeting of the Constitutional provision employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.683" offset="915435">We have discussed standing in -- at length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.529" offset="930900">And in October, in the Richardson Case, it was discussed at length, and I think it's possible to fairly brief about the standing issue here is a straightforward one.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.514" offset="966844">Respondents complained, claim standing as citizen and taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.904" offset="984398">And the injury alleged is at the presence of Congressmen in the military reserves deprives respondents of a right to unbiased consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.893" offset="1028284">This is a quotation from their brief “Of majors before the Congress affecting the military establishment and appropriations therefore and majors relating to military action, war and peace.”</text>
            <text syncTime="253.381" offset="1090247">The District Court as I say denied taxpayers standing but granted citizenship standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.712" offset="1107592">The Court of Appeals in affirming cited Flast against Cohen and does seem to say that perhaps there was taxpayers standing here as well as citizenship standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.005" offset="1148761">I think it's clear that there no standing exist under either theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.231" offset="1165688">Our brief discusses cases such as the Students Challenge the Regulatory Agency Procedures, the SCRAP case and it's a -- we discussed at some length to the fact that this Court has extended the concept of standing by adding to the kinds of injuries that may be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.710" offset="1247608">But so far as we know there's never been a case that says, there need not be direct injury specific and perceptible harm is never been enough in this Court were a plaintiff to alleged an interest in good government or in Constitutional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.627" offset="1315213">And we think that's absolutely clear from the brief and from Frothingham against Mellon, the Sierra Club case, SCRAP case, Ex parte Levitt, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.389" offset="1350322">A respondent's attempt evade this body of law with the contention that there complain alleges very specific injuries and those very specific injuries turn out to be their inability to influence Congress which is not specified, we don't exactly how they were unable to influence Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.136" offset="1437257">And an inability they say to join with others in an effort to make political advocacy effective.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="346.834" offset="1464111">I suppose -- I suppose that the theory is that the 117 or whether number of members who hold reserve commissions are not receptive to the arguments, political arguments that they want to advance, that they're not has to open-minded as Congressmen generally.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="366.249" stopTime="635.516">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="366.249" offset="1541747">I think that is the part of the allegation Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.269" offset="1561809">I think it is an allegation that fails because it is entirely speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.449" offset="1582498">We don't know specifically what measures where affected by this attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.757" offset="1603814">We do not even know in fact that the attitude exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.577" offset="1615099">Respondents assume a one-way relationship between the membership and the Reserves and the political attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.491" offset="1638713">The respondents themselves are reserve as to appear the whole political attitude is not in conformity with those they alleged that Congressmen hold or the Reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.116" offset="1681241">The other point about that statement however is that the citation in NAACP versus Button is -- only beside the point because there is no allegation here and either could we not with anybody, and most particularly not the Congress has taken any action which prevents respondents from joining together to make their political advocacy effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.760" offset="1763788">The only claim is an attitudinal claim, a claim about the attitudes of Congress or about Congressional reservists.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.596" offset="1795135">So that for these reasons, they have alleged the most specific injury, no specific action.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.582" offset="1823033">Secondly, they are really complaining about attitudes that don't correspond to their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.336" offset="1842051">And assume as I say a simple one-way relationship but is not shown and I don't think it could be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.390" offset="1866292">And indeed it occurs to me, because I think about that, that I don't know how long we try an issue like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.620" offset="1887190">If you try to make a question of Congressional attitudes, a question of fact to show an injury, you would have to try the issue of Congressional motivation on particular pieces of legislation, the motivation of individual Congressmen and that's an issue which this Court have en loath to get into at least of Fletcher against Peck in 1810.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.178" offset="1977469">Finally, I think it's clear that respondents are asserting no more than the interest of citizens in the conduct of Government, and that is precise to the interest to this case as this Court has again begin in Baker against Carr and Ex parte Levitt said “It does not suffice to confer standing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="492.490" offset="2046746">I think the political nature of respondents theory of standing and what the breads of that theory really appears that in page ten of their brief in which they discussed the fact to this Court, by expanding the concepts of standing has done much to permit grievances of private citizens against something describe as an increasingly all-powerful Government to be litigated in the courts and not fought in the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.087" offset="2181120">So I take it as a general right of petition by citizens directed to the Court that is advocated here for political grievance, and that is a theory of standing the Court has never accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.558" offset="2223020">And I think should not accept or obvious Article III policy reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.607" offset="2247158">They do attempt to analogize their case to Baker against Carr, that however was a case in which under represented citizens could prove arithmetically that their votes were be valued as much as if their balance have been burned or the voting age have been raised selectively for their counties and we have already seen the reasons why that kind of perceptible, calculable injury is not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.150" offset="2373381">I should say about Ex parte Levitt, the respondents say, albeit, in their brief on page 16, that Levitt's only interest in seeking the disqualification of Mr. Justice Black on the first section of Article I, Section 6, Clause 2 about Senators are not being appointed to civil office.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.352" offset="2466168">A more image being been increased during the time he was a senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.034" offset="2488842">They say of that, that Mr. Levitt's status was only that of a member of the bar and he did not assert with Justice Black's alleged ineligibility could in any way deprive him Levitt of unbiased consideration by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.487" offset="2550700">The moving papers on that case is a matter of fact state only that Mr. Levitt was a member of this bar of this Court, however the Court took it in the opinion as both a citizenship claim and a member of the bar claim and this allowed standing in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.471" offset="2614648">I think it would be instructed --</text>

            <text syncTime="744.499" offset="3054759">But if you turn to it as citizenship standing in the Levitt case and make the additional allegation that I have supposed that as a citizen he was disturbed by the judicial attitudes of Mr. Justice Black and that he could not report with, perhaps do things that he disapprove of politically or judicially or some other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.232" offset="3133649">I don't think that allegation would have conferred standing in the Levitt case and yet that allegation makes the standing issue there precisely the same as it is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.546" offset="3182968">Flast against Cohen, I will say only the taxpayer does -- standing here does not exist because Flast against Cohen lays down two requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.403" offset="3226331">The first is, that the Congressional action challenge must have been an action under the Taxing and Spending Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.901" offset="3256320">And second is that the action must be in derogation of a Constitutional provision which was intended to operate as a restriction upon the taxing and spending power, neither of those is true here obviously because, the status of Congressmen as reservists is not Congressional action under the Taxing and Spending Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.630" offset="3347226">And the second test is not met for the reason that this Article I, Section 6, Clause 2 is obviously as I think both sides in this case agree, designed to prevent the executive domination of the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.938" offset="3408457">It is not designed to limit the taxing and spending power, now the District Court denied taxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.597" offset="3447118">Taxpayers standing, emphasizing this ground and I would refer the Court, if I may to pages 29 and 30 of the Government's Petition for Certiorari where the District Court is reasoning upon that point is contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.116" offset="3509185">I will not dwell upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.527" offset="3530815">I think the Article III reasons why standing remains the crucial concept to the function of Constitutional review or judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.467" offset="3574596">A concept that requires that cases come up in specific factual context which are instructive as to what general principles mean and to prevent to federal court to be drawn in the philosophic debates immediately after the passage of legislation before anybody can show any direct specific harm or how the legislation works.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.011" offset="3664771">I would like instead the pass if I may to the second of our arguments which is that this claim is a political question which is therefore nonjusticiable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.496" offset="5166707">Sounds very much like a qualification for a Membership in Congress and indeed that is precisely the same structure that the Constitution uses in Article I Sections 2 and 3 when it states “No person shall be a member of the House” states the age and the residence requirements and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.482" offset="5238700">In addition to that, if you look at the two parts of Article I Section 6, Clause 2, the first part says, “no Senator or Representative shall be appointed to Office in the certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.798" offset="5303902">The second half says “no Person who is on Office shall be a Senator, a member of either house.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.325" offset="6282031">We have an addition in our brief which I shall not re -- recapitulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.788" offset="6303869">A lengthy history of Congresses the treatment of Article I Section 6, Clause 2 as a -- as a qualification over which it has exclusive control, the earliest case which is cited is that of -- in 1803 of Representative Van Ness, respondents cite that case to argue that the militia commission there involved was like a reserve commission today, I don't know about that, I don't know the historical record well enough on the record I have doesn't disclose enough about that militia commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.409" offset="6446393">Be that as it may, what it does show is that Congress thought it had control of that issue as a qualification issue and that -- these early cases which on our brief are really quite important because there are very close to the time of Constitutional convention and the Congress clearly thought, it was in control of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.583" offset="6539076">And, I should stress that Congress also has thought that it decides the meaning of this Clause as well as the facts as in -- we --we show on our brief on page 39 that in 1806 for example, the Congress decided that a government contractor was not an officer within the meaning of this Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.663" offset="6631445">I should say that respondent's brief on this point seems to me to contain to non sequitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.793" offset="6667912">Pages 28 and 29, the respondents argue from the purpose of the Incompatibility Clause which is to ensure the separation of the Executive Legislator branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.576" offset="6719007">Then in the middle of page 29, they say the purpose is obviously equally well served and incompatibility eliminated whether the one office or the other is vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.055" offset="6764983">Hence, the Incompatibility Clause operates as a restrain on both the executive and the legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.844" offset="6788075">Both are under on equal obligations, I think that is a non sequitur of course if there is a -- an incompatibility, I think there is not, it would be cured equally whether the legislature or the executive operator but that kind of argument means that there is no issue in the exclusive control of another court and branch of government because you can always say well, whenever is -- whatever is troublesome, is cured equally well, if the Court acts instead of the Congress of if the executive acts instead of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.175" offset="6937496">So the statement to that, the incompatibility if it exists would be eliminated if the executive were required to act in no way demonstrates that the issue in fact is committed to the executive or to the courts and the Constitution we think the fact demonstrates the contrary, I think it would be well to say just a word in conclusion about what these reserve commissions are, because I think they have been overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.864" offset="7080229">We have here, in the active Standby Reserve which I think is the only Reserve status that can even arguably be called an office, 20 members of Congress in the inactive Standby Reserve, we have 12 members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.445" offset="7146580">I won't mention the inactive Standby Reserve again because the inactive Standby Reserve receives nothing and may not train even if he volunteers for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.435" offset="7182524">It's an honorary status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.266" offset="7193809">Then we have 58 members of Congress who are retired without pay and I take of one, I've got to include them on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.018" offset="7216797">They are in 107 Congressmen we're talking about, but they certainly is can hardly be called an office to be retired without pay, there are 16 Congressmen retired with pay of them six are retired for disability, ten for after period of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.327" offset="7286073">So we have at 20 reservists in the active standby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.733" offset="7303732">Now, I think it's demonstrable that in the active Standby that is not only -- not an office on United States but there is no executive control over these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.038" offset="7352947">And, recall the Hardwell case which is discussed in both briefs which suggested that an office on the United States is defined by tenure duration, emolument and duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.221" offset="7409580">None of these categories accept the active Standby has any possibility of falling within that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.449" offset="7442495">An active Standby Reserve may apply for training but it's entirely voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.579" offset="7467050">He's not called up, he receives no pay while he is in training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.437" offset="7490456">He receives no allowances, he pays for his own food, he plays -- pays for his own uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.082" offset="7513025">He pays for his own travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.974" offset="7520653">The only expense for the Government involved as opposed to going to the firing range and use up ammunition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.410" offset="7542387">But one thing he can do is by training regularly at his own expense, is acquire training points towards retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.920" offset="7588467">He gets one training point if he volunteers for this training, for each four-hour drill and one training point for each day of summer activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.487" offset="7626710">And If he gets a minimum of 50 for 20 years, he then gets a relatively small pension at the age of 60 but that is the entire financial connection that any of these reservist has and it's very small and very few Congressmen indeed goes to that training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.322" offset="7706018">Now, the respondents I have cited on pages 40 and 41 of their brief elements of executive control over these reservists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.269" offset="7737783">I think I have shown just a right little, but let me take them by category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.792" offset="7759935">The respondents state that these reservists are subject to call by the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.791" offset="7783863">That is true, only with respect to the ready reserve which is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.212" offset="7805597">There is one Congressman in the Ready Reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.122" offset="7817195">He can be removed from that only with the consent of a governor of his state because it's a National Guard position, he is not involved in this case because the case is against the governor or him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.115" offset="7869231">Of the active Standby Reserve, they can be called by the president only if Congress declares a natural -- national emergency or war under 10 United States Code Section 6782.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.888" offset="7932343">So they are not a subject to call by the president unless Congress authorizes the call as the salaries and expenses, there are none, there is a very small possibility for some of them of a small pension at the end of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.484" offset="7994723">If the respondents say that they are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the only time, any of these reserves is so subject is when he is on -- when he has voluntarily gone into training and voluntarily submitted himself to the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.416" offset="8058462">The retired reservist is subject to the code only when he is receiving hospitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.259" offset="8089809">There is a mention of the enlistment term -- enlistment term and the oath unless one of these Congressmen is in the reserve because he has a remaining obligation after having been drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.419" offset="8130456">He has no term and can resign, in the oath he takes is simply the one we all take to support and defend the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.684" offset="8167445">I think it is entirely plane from what I've said that out of the 107 Congressmen in the reserves, only 20 are in the status where they can do anything to gain any benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.268" offset="8233796">Very few of them do, they train at their own expense and I don't think under the definitions of the cases, it could in any sense be called an Office onto the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.190" offset="8473496">The question before this Court today is the interpretation of Incompatibility Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 6, Clause 2 which prohibits the same individual from holding at the same time executive branch office and be seated in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.982" offset="8560640">And Solicitor General has stated the three issues which are raised before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.806" offset="8591987">First of all, seems to us whether or not this kind of reserve commission is an office which the Clause prohibits a member of Congress from holding while he remains a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.417" offset="8646426">Secondly, whether the plaintiffs here have a standing, whether we have proper parties to raise that issue and thirdly, even if the answer to the first two questions is yes, whether this is a political question that the Court should not decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.474" offset="8710687">The Clause is older than our Constitution, it appeared first in the Articles of Confederation and I believe was first proposed eight days after our nation was born on July 12, 1976 in the Continental Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.358" offset="8790204">The basic -- the basic principle that a member of Continental Congress should not hold any office at that time under any of the states because we had a very rudimentary national Government was in the Article V, I believe of the Articles of Confederation and the Clause was stated in the Articles of Confederation as in -- in terms that no member of the Continental Congress shall hold any office as to which there are salaries, emoluments or other -- Article V, Clause 2 of the Articles of Confederation -- nor shall any person being a delegate be capable of holding any office unto the United States for which he or any other for his benefit receives any salary fees or emoluments of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.594" offset="9063131">The matter was debated at a considerable length during the Constitutional convention and the debates are quoted in our brief and also with the Solicitor General's brief, I won't repeat them but it is quite clear from the statements of Mr. Elbridge Jerry, Mr. George Mason, Madison, Hamilton, and others that the purpose of the Clause was to prevent an evil which was quite palpable and obvious to the framers, an evil that they saw rise in the English parliamentary system under which the officers of -- that the crown by holding out the possibility of office and appointing members of parliament to office was able to control votes in the parliament.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.727" offset="9259677">And so, they erected an inflexible and absolute barrier as they thought, against any member of the legislative branch, the house of the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.175" offset="9465417">It's equally explicit but there was -- I don't know if I can find the right word but I think there was more of an effect, a desire of an effect beforehand in the first half of Article I, Section 6 in which they were speaking directly to the members of Congress, to say, you shall not create offices, you shall not create or increase the emoluments of offices to which you then may seek appointment and this was something rather more directly aimed at preventing any activity by the members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.214" offset="9621629">The second half of the Clause, the debates made it quite clear, were aimed not only at the Congress but indeed, primarily according to the debates at the executive branch to prevent the executive branch from encroaching upon from influencing the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.150" offset="9681398">The bar is no less absolute but I think it's important to note that there were these two different evils that they were aiming at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.179" offset="9721417">The Clause had a curious history and in attempting to find why it ended up with the language that it presently has, we found that as it came out of the Committee of Detail on August 6, and this is in the District Court's opinion in the appendix to the petition for certiorari at page 19, it said, the members of each house shall be ineligible to and incapable of holding any office under the authority of the United States during the time for which they shall respectively be elected and the members of the Senate shall be ineligible to and capable of holding any such office for one year afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.630" offset="9911275">This was the Incompatibility Clause on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.033" offset="9936875">It then came out of the Committee, it went into the Committee of Eleven and this is quoted on page 34 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.607" offset="9983164">The members of each house shall be ineligible to any civil office under the authority of the United States during the time for which they shall respectively be elected and no person holding any office under the United States shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.884" offset="10052336">In that form, the Clause stated two things, it said no member shall hold any office while he remains a member and no person holding any office shall be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.199" offset="10101551">In the Committee of Eleven, according to Ferrand, that Clause was -- that language was amended by the insertion after the words, United States of the following words created where the emoluments whereof -- have been increased because the Clause as it stood did not have within it the prohibition that you -- Mr. Chief Justice, just referred to against the one that was involved in Levitt, against members, against the Congress creating offices and then obtaining their own appointments to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.790" offset="10291931">And the way in which this was accomplished was by insertion of that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.176" offset="10313456">The rest of the Clause remained the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.073" offset="10325055">We cannot speculate because there is no -- there is nothing in the debates as to what the Framers had in mind in doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.571" offset="10355043">But it seems to me that it would be wrong to say that by doing that, they intended to make the Clause expressly applicable only to a member only to say that a person holding an office shall not be a member which is the interpretation of the Government has urged upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.144" offset="10453368">It seems to me that what -- what happened to the Clause during the debates does not -- it cannot lead us to that conclusion and that the history of it and its final language does support our contention that the Clause is intended as an absolute bar against members holding any office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.428" offset="10542498">This is in turn supported by the later history of the Clause and in particular, I would refer the Court to the 1899 House Report 2205 which is cited in portions of which you quoted in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.812" offset="10648033">But on 50 -- page 57 of that report, the Congress refers to the interpretation of the provision by James Wilson who was one of the Framers -- indeed who is one of the Framers who himself argued against the insertion of the Incompatibility Clause in the Constitution and who also was one of the first members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.451" offset="10746567">And the -- the report shows that in states -- that in lectures he delivered in 1790 and 1791, he took the view and stated, with respect to this Clause that it is a provision by which the members of the legislature will be precluded while they remain such from offices and then he said that this provision finds with great propriety -- a place in the Constitution of the United States, and in this important particular, it has a decided superiority over the Constitution of Great Britain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.762" offset="10919811">So I think it is quite clear that the intention of the Framers was that members of Congress while they remain members of Congress shall not hold any other office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.485" offset="10970697">There is a second principle which is likewise set out -- expanded in great length in the same report beginning on page 64 and going on over the page 69 of that report in which many, many cases decided by the State Courts of the United States and by the Courts of Great Brittain were cited as establishing the -- the proposition that when there are incompatible offices, when the same person is appointed to an office which is incompatible with an office which he already holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.987" offset="11120744">That when he qualifies and accepts the second office, he automatically vacates the first, that the proposition as -- as stated in short hand in the District Court's opinion, the second office vacates the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.843" offset="11180095">In this case, as I -- as I understand it, every member who is a reservist was in the Reserves prior to his election to the Congress and the application of that principle would require that on accepting and qualifying as a member of Congress, he should automatically have vacated his office as a member of the Reserves.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.783" offset="11383850">Yes Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan, I would say that of course, that did not occur because there had to be some further action by one or the other of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.954" offset="11432542">Either the person holding the commission who had just been elected to Congress or the executive branch which continued to maintain him in that status in order -- in order -- in fact for the status to end but in law, it would seem according to these authorities that he should be held to have vacated the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.299" offset="11517910">And all that remains is that -- that vacation be declared by a body competent to declare it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.800" offset="11551974">Which brings us to this -- to the question of whether or not this is -- the Clause establishes a qualification which is exclusively committed to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.033" offset="11612891">The Solicitor General has argued that it speaks as a qualification and just like the qualifications of age and inhabitancy and citizenship, it is the kind of qualification which this Court in Powell v. McCormack said was committed only to the Congress and which could not be adjudicated by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.305" offset="11701917">First of all, there is a difference in that -- those qualifications -- are matters -- as we said in our brief matters of -- of pre-existing fact which no one can change and I supposed that even the doctrine that these are matters which are exclusively committed to the Congress cannot be absolute, that for example, if the Congress were all of a sudden by vote to say that a senator who was 60 years old was only 20 years old and thereby expel him from the Congress, that one way or another, that Senator would have the right to have some court, a federal court and ultimately this Court somehow or other review that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="4138.761" offset="16631745">Well, I would -- I would only submit that -- that nothing this Court does will interfere with the power of the Senate where it has -- itself to determine the qualifications of any of its members and there are political considerations both ways involved in what the Congress may do which is not what this Court does or what any Court does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.701" offset="16707500">And that this Court's determination will in no way either inhibit or -- or impose any requirement on the Congress with respect to the qualification of a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.156" offset="16749401">And perhaps there is indeed wisdom in the Court's deciding questions like this because as this Court's said in -- in Brewster, this isn't the kind of thing that Congress perhaps should not lay aside its normal activities and take on the responsibility in the court's words, to police and prosecute the myriad activities of its members.So it may be that this is the kind of decision which in the separation of powers under our Constitution, the Court should undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.717" offset="16887641">With respect to standing which is an important issue in this case, I think it's important that the injury here be viewed in light of the intent of the Framers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.084" offset="16929123">In the intent of the Framers, I think it's clear was to avoid even the potential of any conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.294" offset="16957962">Even the potential of any executive influence and I could refer to -- I would refer the Court to the Dixon-Yates case the United States versus Mississippi Valley Generating Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.953" offset="17004565">In particular 364 U.S. at page 549 in which discussing another conflict of interest provision that in a statute, the Court said that the statute is directed not only at this honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.429" offset="17054511">But also a conduct that tempts dishonor and thus as in Board of Governors v. Agnew which was cited by the District Court at a potential and that as the Court continued on page 551 of the opinion in Mississippi Valley that it was intended by the Congress in that statute to establish a rigid rule of conduct and I think that the Incompatibility Clause is no less rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.105" offset="17153149">With respect further to this matter of injury I would like to refer the Court to the -- to its -- to the recent decision in the United States versus SCRAP and to point out that there where users of the environment, users of the parks were able to show the possibility of injury by way of the littering of the areas that they use for recreational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.981" offset="17268715">That is much like what we have here where we have shown -- we have shown very clearly the potential for harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.910" offset="17300376">The possibility of littering there, the potential for damage to the -- to our ability to influence members of Congress here and there is a further analogy I think and that there, the Court found that those individual plaintiffs were users of the specific recreational areas in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.757" offset="17371742">We too have shown that we are in that sense users of the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="4351.980" offset="17484696">The Ex parte Levitt is a very peculiar kind of decision in that as -- as the Court has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.178" offset="17509460">It was reached on the basis of a motion filed in this Court for a permission to file a petition that Justice Black not be permitted to take his seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.061" offset="17548957">And I went back and read the opinion, the cases that were cited by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.182" offset="17569437">First of all, the first case was Tyler v. Judges in 179 U.S. 405 where the Court there citing (Inaudible) on pleadings discussed the fact that a party to have standing must be one whose legal right has been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.692" offset="17639549">And then Southern Railroad versus King, that one I didn't understand because that seemed only to involve the sufficiency of an answer to raise the issue of the repugnance of a statute to the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.871" offset="17684271">In Newman versus Frizzell, that was a suite in quo warranto to challenge the appointment of a DC commissioner and the Court held that the -- the writ, quo warranto was not available to someone who himself did not claim a right to hold the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.641" offset="17751353">Fairchild v.-- versus Hughes was a suite to declare the female suffrage amendment to the Constitution null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.094" offset="17785104">And Justice Brandeis said that this was not a case or controversy because among other things in this -- in --in Mr. Fairchild's own state, New York, women had been granted the right to vote so that the amendment did not do him any greater injury than he had already suffered by the activist's own legislature and I think it's implicit in that case that if it had been otherwise, he might well have had standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.934" offset="17888444">And finally of course, the Court cited Massachusetts v. Mellon, and I won't -- I won't go into that any further I think what Frothingham v. Mellon means today was very carefully explained by this Court in Flast v.Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.328" offset="17958034">Where -- why Levitt is important is that it has been cited by this Court in two or three recent cases in particular in Laird versus Tatum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.645" offset="17991367">And there, I think it's important to note the context in which it was cited, cited in the context of a situation where the individual plaintiffs in that particular case, themselves had admitted that they had not been injured that they had suffered no inhibition of their own exercise of their first amendment rights on the basis -- on the basis of the surveillance that have been visited upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.003" offset="18092722">And so, I --I would submit that Ex-parte Levitt does not, this very brief and per curiam opinion on a motion by Mr. Levitt as a -- as a member of the bar should not -- should not be adopted by this Court as a limiting principle and as -- as -- and the taking away from what this Court has -- has granted in effect in Flast v. Cohen.</text>
