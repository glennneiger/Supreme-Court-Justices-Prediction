            <text syncTime="40.177" offset="237505">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.524" offset="270838">This case is before this Court on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.646" offset="299363">The narrow question involved is the validity of the order of the Trial Court, denying intervention by respondents in an antitrust treble-damage action based upon a prior government action after the running of the pertinent statute of limitations, Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.506" offset="406779">Before beginning, I should note that I shall be referring to the key dates, which are pertinent to this statute of limitations question and these key dates are set forth in the record appendix, pages 1 to 4 in summary form.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.660" offset="483370">And I should also indicate that the statutes, which we believe to be pertinent in controlling and the rules of Court, are set forth in the following six pages also of the record appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.025" offset="540839">As I indicated, this case is based upon a denial of a motion made by respondents in the Central District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.510" offset="574798">In December 1969, to intervene in an antitrust damage action, which have been filed by the State of Utah on May 13, 1969 and has a purported class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.221" offset="629656">The Utah complaint alleges that the action was based on prior government, criminal and equitable actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.979" offset="672705">And thus, by reasons of the prior government actions and pursuant to the tolling provisions of Sections 5 (b) of the Clayton Act, the State of Utah was able to bring this action, based upon alleged acts, which entered in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.245" offset="749714">The government criminal action in which the Utah complaint was based was beyond March 10, 1964 and was terminated as to all defendants on June 19, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.416" offset="802377">A separate government civil action filed after the criminal action ended, it was terminated as to all defendants, except American Pipe and Construction Company on December 8, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.665" offset="863399">With the final judgment as to American Pipe and Construction Company, it wasn?t filed until May 24, 1968 and as by reason of this day of May 24, 1968 that the Trial Court has held at the date of one year later, May 24, 1969 was the date of the statute of limitations finally ran in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.833" offset="968098">The District Court on December 4, 1969 entered in order that Utah action did not constitute a class action and subsequently, entered an order made after that denial of the class action by respondents, the denying respondents? motion to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.568" offset="1059004">It is this order denying intervention at this juncture, which is a subject of these appellate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.575" offset="1087007">The Court of Appeals reversed the order of the Trial Court denying leave to intervene and held that this suit was instituted on behalf of respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.107" offset="1121176">By the filing of the Utah complaint on May 13, 1969, even though the prerequisites to our class action had not been met by the State of Utah and even though respondents took no action, no step, whatsoever to intervene, until December 19, 1969, a date more than five months after the limitations period prescribed by 5 (b) of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.185" offset="1229531">The narrow question involves therefore, is whether respondents, who had not filed suit within the period prescribed by Section 5 (b), were appropriate before the Trial Court by reason of the fact that the State of Utah erroneously designated its cause of action as a class action, and though this case may appear to have very superficial, factual, or complexity of terms on the very simple issue of Congressional intent in enacting Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="326.310" offset="1381982">Mr. O'Malley, is there anything peculiar to the Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act about the Ninth Circuit?s reasoning here?</text>
            <text syncTime="334.254" offset="1413747">Wouldn't it apply equally well to any other claim of statute of limitation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jesse R. O'Malley</label>
            <text syncTime="337.843" offset="1428167">Yes, indeed and that is of course as we have planned out, Mr. Justice Rehnquist in connection with our petition for certiorari, this has the effect as we see it of affecting in every Federal statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.020" offset="1496816">By the mere fact that a class action is typed on our complaint, even though one does not in fact exist, it has the effect by virtue of the act of a private party of tolling the statute of limitations and I would say yes indeed that is indeed one of the major issues, not only in so far as 5 (b) of the Clayton Act is concerned, which is pertinent to this case, but I think the principle is applicable equally, Mr. Justice Rehnquist to every Federal statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.634" offset="1635265">I would submit that the intent, in connection with 5 (b) as to what the statute really means is clearly stated in the barring provision of the statute and it is also stated we submit with some precision and the legislative reports underlying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.579" offset="1727112">It should first be noted that the State of Utah is in Court only because of 5 (b), which provides for the suspension of the government -- of the statute of limitations during the pendency of the government antitrust action in which limits the period -- in which the litigant may commence an action based upon the government suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.902" offset="1804330">To the period of the pendency over the government civil or criminal action, and within one year thereafter, respondents did not move within that statutory period and were not before the Court, until after the one year suspension period, unless the filing of the invalid class action by Utah has a legal effect of bringing respondents before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.801" offset="1887922">In order to escape the barring provisions of the Clayton Act, the opinion of the Court of Appeals via legal section treats the respondents as if they had filed suits simultaneously with the State of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.598" offset="1943092">However, factually it is not with -- there's no dispute about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.606" offset="1955213">They had done nothing in any factual sense at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.279" offset="1973812">They?d done nothing whatsoever and they haven't brought an action of their own volition and they hadn't move to intervene and either of these steps would merely have required the respondents to file a short and plain statement of the alleged violations and its purported impact upon the plaintiff.And we submit that in enacting 5 (b) of the Clayton Act, the Congress clearly intended to spell out the requirement that each plaintiff relying up on Section 5 (b) to toll a statute of limitations, must take the minimal step of stating its claim within the period prescribed by the statute.Now, where there is no class action, of course that would require the filing of the short and plain statement of the claim, pursuant to Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.065" offset="2852989">Mr. O'Malley, isn't possible to defend Judge Pence's decision in the District Court consistently with the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, saying in effect that the statute was tolled during the pendency of the action, but in the times following Judge Pence's ruling on the class action, the 11 days afterwards that the plaintiffs were then under an obligation to file actions of their own and it is decision, denying intervention might be justified on grounds applicable to intervention, without saying that they were cut-off, had they chosen to file their actions, rather than to intervene in Utah's action?</text>

            <text syncTime="769.424" offset="3154442">The Trial Court by reason of its knowledge and experience in the West Coast Pipe case which have preceded and within the framework at the time that was available through the respondents during the period prior to the running of the statute and in the framework of the fact that the facts of this case showed that counsel for that is preparing on behalf of response in this case, at this time they couldn't study this action for six months and this prior to the filing of the suit, it was charge with the problems of knowledge of the problems of the statute of limitations growing out of the prior litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.036" offset="3304908">I think in the light of that history, clearly the Court is justified in exercising its discretion and I think in incorporating its decision respecting the class action in this decision on the motions to intervene I think the theory was exercising the discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.110" offset="4029231">When Congress has specifically held that Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act is a barring statute under the circumstances of this case that is true because the basic contention of the respondents and the contention which essentially was adapted by the Court of Appeals is that Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act is somehow a abridge or modified by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and we would submit that this is contrary to the enabling act, which expressly authorizes this Court to promulgate the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, but which prohibits such rules from abridging, enlarging, or modifying any substance of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.978" offset="4288679">And of course, the basic premise of the Court of Appeals and of the respondents in this action is also, a contrary to the elementary and Hornbook principle at Court rules whatever they may be are subject to Congressional Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.421" offset="4370390">The legislative history of Section 5 (b) clearly establishes that, that Statute has a dual purpose to give timely notice of the claims within the periods stated by the statute and the barring of causes of action not timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.072" offset="4441025">Each of these purposes is distorted by the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.323" offset="4465998">The mere filing of a class action, whether it is valid or invalid, doesn't give notice to defendants as to the claims of members of the class or nonclass, which will be asserted there until members of the class actually do assert such claims prior thereto neither members of the class nor their claims are identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.366" offset="4554188">In further end, if it is under Rule 23, members of the class have the option out of this litigation pursuant to Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.288" offset="4589923">Now, and it is particularly true that their mere filing of the pleading bearing the label, the class action doesn't have any meaning, and then afford any meaningful notice, where as in this case, there have been seven prior class actions, in which the class has been exhaustively solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.924" offset="4668395">Now, the history of this case in the West Coast Pipe litigation establishes in very practical terms at the purposes of the statute that the filing of the statute give notice to defendants just doesn?t exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.038" offset="4728895">In his opinion, Judge Pence pointed out that in the West Coast Pipe cases, some 300 parties intervened and stated claims in those seven prior class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.254" offset="4765780">In this case, after the action was filed by the State of Utah, no member of the class ever appeared to state their claims until five months after the limitations period and they didn't do so even then, until it was solicited by plaintiff's counsel and plaintiff's counsel obtain relief from respondents separate boards resent such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.757" offset="4847804">And indeed, at that point, counsel for respondents stated to respondents, this in the record, that the statute probably ran on May 24, 1969, which was a date some five months prior at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.571" offset="4907050">So, that interveners filed this motion was noticed that the statute had ran as to them and defendants never did have notice of the purported members of the claims by over the purported claims by members of the class, until five months after the period prescribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.022" offset="4988865">A case which we believe comes close to being on all force with this case is I. O'Connor against Anastasia, which we have cited in our brief for another point where Judge Medina, when he was sitting on the District Court, with respect to a Fair Labor Standards Acts, stated that in the case where a motion there and has been like -- as in this case was filed after the Statute had run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.232" offset="5097639">He stated that defendants had no notice whatsoever that any claim was made on behalf of any of the claimants that is this case exactly, because although no class action was alleged here, in that case, none exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.316" offset="5158034">And, Judge Medina went on to say it will not suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.202" offset="5173603">He's talking about the issue of notice here, that someone else has a pending lawsuit against the defendant, sought to be charge, in which a similar, but different claim are alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.047" offset="5224908">The language of House Report Number 422, Eighty-fourth Congress First Session of 1955, we believe confirms a principle that timely affirmative notice by each plaintiff is required to give defendant's notice of each claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.442" offset="5302544">And, this appears from a language of that report, which states that in cases where the plaintiff's action has been suspended by the pendency of government antitrust proceedings, he would be required to bring his action, either within the suspension period, i.e. one year after the government suit had terminated or within the four year statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.632" offset="5399301">This clearly stated requirement mandates, we believe affirmative action by each claimant within the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.491" offset="5434723">And any other construction would make the barring provision of the statute without meaning to permit this intervention, as in this case, after the barring period has run, after the statute has run, is tantamount in the equivalent and is identical to granting an additional tolling period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.665" offset="5527406">Enacting 5 (b), Congress clearly stated its intent to eliminate the very kind of additional tolling exceptions and extensions, which is a basis for the Court of Appeals verdict in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.473" offset="5598668">The report referred to a private treble damage action, which has been based on the suit against the motion picture industry, which was pending during the 40s by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.886" offset="5644330">And stated that the extent to which this litigation in this case was extended by virtue of various tolling provisions of Federal Law is disposed by the following table indicating the inadvisability of prolonging the limitation period in such instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.724" offset="5715696">While a committee considers as highly desirable to toll the statutes of limitations during a government antitrust action into grant plaintiffs a reasonable time or after in which to bring suit, it does not believe that the unduly prolongation of proceedings of this type is conducive to effective and efficient enforcement of the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.553" offset="5810991">And, thus if it would clearly appear that the Congressional policy is stated in such report is to eliminate that very kind of additional tolling periods, authorized by the opinion of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.236" offset="5873685">We submit that the decision of the Ninth Circuit can't be squared with the intent to eliminate tolling extensions and exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.470" offset="5914645">And it can't be squared with a requirement than in a case where, which is this case, where the statute of limitations has been suspended by the pendency of a government antitrust proceedings, such plaintiff would be required to bring his action within one year after the government suit has terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.105" offset="5993117">Contrary, to the plain meaning of the statute, the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeals if a class action is filed, members of the purported class would be run an additional tolling period, beyond the statutory period, until the Court determines, whether the action maybe maintained as a class action, in this case it was five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.923" offset="6104398">In Eisen against Carlisle, which is now pending on this Court, pursuant to a writ of certiorari, the additional tolling period would have been approximately five years and during this period, under the decision of the Court of Appeals, plaintiff's counsel is authorized by such a thing to solicit class members until a negative class has been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.780" offset="6191856">At that point, he has able to bring motions on behalf of those he solicited and that's what occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.600" offset="6219128">And this is contrary we submit to the principle that the power to create tolling extensions and exceptions is limited by the general rule that when a Federal statute of limitations exist, such as 5 (b) it access a total bar, extinguishing the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.471" offset="6306586">That concept was stated by this Court in Holmberg against Armbrecht, 327 US, at page 395 in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.130" offset="6349218">If Congress explicitly puts limits upon the time for enforcing a right, which it is created that is amended on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.645" offset="6387357">The Ninth Circuit stated the proposition in somewhat similar language with respect to the statute of limitations, with respect to the Federal Tort Claims Act that a Federal District Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit after the statute of limitations is run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.896" offset="6472307">Despite their contention, we believe that respondent's position, if we understand the thrust of it is that the barring provisions of -- and it is the premise of the opinion of Court of Appeals that the barring provision of 5 (b) are somehow limited by Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.398" offset="6590380">We submit that consistent with the intent of Congress, the filing of a class action can have no bearing as to whether claimants had satisfied the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.723" offset="6631654">If Rule 23 affects the limitations, as stated in 5 (b) in any respects, it constitutes an abridgement of such Statute by Rule of Court.If the applicability of Section 5 (b) is dependent upon whether the class action is alleged or found, it is a capricious standard, which is inconsistent with the clearly stated Congressional intent.And, as I have stated earlier, Section -- the barring provisions of Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.914" offset="7588362">I think the facts of this case are particularly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.627" offset="7603304">The State of Utah filed its class action, eleven days prior to the running of the suspension period provided by Section 5 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.759" offset="7639771">The State was fully aware of the fact that that suspension period was about to run and it undertook to protect this lesser governmental bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.304" offset="7678015">Those are the -- at least some of them are the respondents before this Court, not the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.837" offset="7700062">No question, but what the States, the antitrust case was filed timely and that?s pending before Judge Pence, right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.544" offset="7734962">The State's action was transferred by the panel down to California in the first major thing that happened was that the motion to determine the class was brought on before Judge Pence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.203" offset="7785535">Judge Pence indicated clearly in my mind that he preferred to handle these matters through joined intervention, and he made reference to his vast experience in handling the West Coast Pipe cases and indicated that this was more efficient, a more desirable way to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.742" offset="7855752">Now, the class action that was alleged by the State, have to yield the affidavits filed in support thereof, indicated that there might be up with some 800 members in that class and Judge Pence pointed out that in his experience, they probably wonder why would it be that many members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.694" offset="7919491">And, he pointed to the fact that the California, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Arizona had been involved in the West Coast Pipe cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.894" offset="7956376">Their populations were much greater than the States of Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho, and he indicated, he expect that they would have one-sevenths of the number that they actually had turn out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.598" offset="9847118">Now, as to the question on abuse to discretion, which just been mentioned, Judge Pence did exercise his discretion as to these specific applicants, he did it in so far as the claims included in the four years preceding the filing of the applications were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.514" offset="9926844">In other words he said, "These claims are not barred and so these parties aren't before me and I cannot deny their motions to intervene."</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.630" offset="9963311">He did that back in March, when he is ruling on the motions for intervention, but states his opinion on March 30, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.676" offset="10003435">And so, we had no final order for the applicants, it was necessary then to have a meeting with all the applicants to determine whether or not they want to sacrifice their claims in their preceding four years, in order that we can secure a final order and appeal to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.601" offset="10063203">And they decided that there would be the better course to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.705" offset="10075533">So then, we amended the proposed complainant intervention to eliminate those years that were not barred by the statute of limitations, whereupon some three months later on July 8, Judge Pence then entered his order, indicated once a final order that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations in denying interventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.703" offset="10151602">So, I don't feel, I don?t and I certainly feel that this case involved abuse of discretion in any way and if in fact it did, I think the Ninth Circuit properly ruled by implication that once the invited intervention is an alternative to the class action procedure, even though it might include some 300 members, as he said, 350 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.345" offset="10238119">I can do it better by intervention then it would certainly be an abuse of discretion to deny those applications for intervention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.908" offset="10652421">But at later time and Rule 23 specifies, as soon as practicable, the Court then, will determine whether or not that action shall be maintained as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.583" offset="10695053">Two different events entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.380" offset="10702263">There"s nothing in the Rule 23 about reliance, quite to the contrary, with the Amendment, now that the unnamed parties you're going to be bound by that judgment, one way or another, always necessary that they receive notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.010" offset="10752836">Best possible notice calculate to reach them, and if they do not opt that, they're going to be bound by the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.609" offset="10771226">They don't have to show they relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.153" offset="10781362">Likewise, in Section 5 (b), provides the suspension treaty that we're dealing with, there's nothing there that concerns relying on anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.392" offset="10818351">It merely provides that the statute will run, unless an action is commenced, the same word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.048" offset="10848967">Unless it?s commenced within one year after the government proceedings have ceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.313" offset="10878015">As far as legislative history is concerned, I think there?s certainly no legislative history on this point, because the Rule was amended until 1966 and it wasn't, it isn't reasonable to suggest that Congress had, was in his contemplation what would happen in connection with the procedural rule determined by this Court as to how you commence an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.178" offset="10953456">And then, clearly Congress left that up to this Court, and the Advisory Council to determine the rules of procedure under the Statutory Grant, promulgate proper rules, as to how you commence an action, Rule 23 said, you commence an action by filing a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.297" offset="11021897">There's nothing at all that shocks me or the thought that on the State of Utah determine that they wanted to undertake to protect their rights of its cities and towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.381" offset="11062230">And label the complaint, a class action that defined that complaint to include those lesser public bodies, the purchased pipes from these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.793" offset="11091905">But that then commenced an action and satisfied Section 5 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.228" offset="11121685">Now, the Ninth Circuit, I think properly decided this question and I think they gave us, in my mind that the least they could?ve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.700" offset="11151569">They indicated that the statute then may -- once the Court determine the class negatively, determine it cannot be maintained, then the statute began to run again, 11 days began to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.141" offset="11193260">And since, at least the majority of these parties filed within eight days, they were safely inside the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.748" offset="11227742">I would suggest to the Court that a better rule would be the one, I think was expressed by Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in Brunette versus New York Central Railroad, that didn't involve class action, but it involve a similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.363" offset="11286152">In that case, in FELA case, the plaintiff filed an action in the Ohio Court and the statute then run, and then the plaintiff discovered that the Ohio Court was the wrong Court and did not have venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.396" offset="11350309">There was no saving statute in Ohio and there was no law in Ohio by which that case could be transferred to a proper court, court with proper venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.499" offset="11386776">So, that case was dismissed and eight days later, interestingly enough, that plaintiff filed an action in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.311" offset="11413943">And this Court held that, that satisfied the statute and the majority in that opinion indicated that the statute did not begin to run again until the appeal time that run in Ohio, unless that was a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.047" offset="11468904">And in the concurring opinion, I feel a better rule stated in that was that once the action been filed, the statute of limitations were satisfied and then, the manner in which the plaintiff pursued that was subject to latches.</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.868" offset="11748206">I suggest that any rule, other than the one that Ninth Circuit came up with and that is a decision contrary to the Ninth Circuit, will do violence to statute of limitations, do violence to the true Congressional attempt, which was uniformity of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.236" offset="11833678">I think if you indulge yourself in theories, such as the class members mostly rely, then those that can provide reliance to satisfaction one Judge or save those cannot barred by the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.542" offset="11894909">Those who were ignored, if the classes order maintained, possibly they're protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.788" offset="11919882">If the classes order not maintained, they're not protected, so you have an unequal application of the statute and in this day and age, especially in antitrust litigation, where you have transfer work courts and transfer re-courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.544" offset="12030955">If you make the statute dependent upon whether or not a Court ultimately orders that the class be maintained, this is going to be very much like springing and shifting uses.</text>
