            <text syncTime="58.840" offset="312111">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.257" offset="321724">I am Gloria Svanas representing the appellants in this case, the Minority Parties from Texas, the American Party of Texas, the Socialist Workers Party of Texas, and the Texas new Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.831" offset="372088">Also, representing the independent candidate Laurel Dunn, who was a candidate for the United States Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.200" offset="405525">This is direct appeal from a three-judge Federal Court in the Western District of Texas finding certain sections of the Texas Election Code to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.548" offset="446903">It is the contention of the appellants, these minority parties that the Texas Election Code is precisely drawn to accomplish the goal that -- what is intended to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.017" offset="492774">That is the purposeful and invidious discriminate against -- pardon me, discrimination against minor parties and independent candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.024" offset="528823">The legislature in Texas arbitrarily and capriciously controls elections in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.485" offset="554736">It has been said that there are four alternative routes to ballot position in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.836" offset="576052">It is urged by the appellants that they’re rather -- there are four exclusionary routes from the ballot in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.354" offset="610116">The first exclusion is based on a difference of opinion with political philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.496" offset="634776">You either join up with the republican and democrat parties in Texas or you are actually excluded, practically excluded from the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.582" offset="675109">You either adopt the political philosophy of the two major parties or you surrender your first amendment freedoms which allow you to practice the philosophy which you believe and to associate and organize political parties for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.187" offset="745535">Once you have participated in the party primary, you are locked in to that particular party.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.569" offset="767060">Actually, voting in a party primary constitutes registration in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.834" offset="792033">Not only from the standpoint of our continuous registration which we now have but also from party affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.186" offset="821499">Only through participation in the major political parties are you allowed the privilege of absentee voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.693" offset="847517">Otherwise, you are completely excluded from absentee voting and if you should desire to go fishing on election day or should you by any other reason be prevented from participating at the ballot box, you will go to the County Clerks Office in Texas and be compelled to either vote republican or democrat of forfeit your right to vote.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="213.949" offset="932571">Do you know of any other State that has such a provision as to absentee ballots being restricted to one of the ballot?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gloria_tanner_svanas" startTime="222.459" stopTime="633.330">
            <label>Ms. Gloria Tanner Svanas</label>
            <text syncTime="222.459" offset="966635">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.921" offset="968411">I have not found one.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.116" offset="973218">I found one particular case this Court had decided in McDonald from the Illinois case but that -- in that one, the absentee privilege is restricted to those who were confined in institutions even though they might just have been under charges and have not been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.314" offset="1046047">I find it little bit harsh to compare the minority parties in Texas to the inmates of penal institutions in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.938" offset="1080529">The added bonus which we have in Texas since the 1971 McKool-Stroud Primary Financing Law which is also part of this appeal is the fact that if you participate in the Republican and the Democrat Primary, you get the bonus of having a tax paid for a primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.323" offset="1162031">If on contrast if you should determine to participate with one of the minority parties, then you are compelled to pay all of these expenses out of the minority party account.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.808" offset="1208007">There are no write-ins in the primaries in Texas since the original time of the rise of the Republican Party in Texas which used to nominate by write-ins in the primary so they exclude the write-ins from primaries when that party started growing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.852" offset="1272163">Actually, the nomination for local offices in Texas by the Democrat Primary as a practical exercise is determity participation because nomination for most offices in Texas by the Democrat Primary is tantamount to election.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.010" offset="1344784">The second exclusion from the ballot in Texas is by the numbers of the votes for Governor which were cast for the candidate of that particular political party in the last gubernatorial or general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.450" offset="1398596">For instance the American Party on 1968 hold 584,000 votes for its nominee for United States President but because the American Party did not have a nominee on the ballot for Governor, it was automatically excluded from the ballot from that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.712" offset="1471634">The question is, is the numbers of vote gained insofar as the gubernatorial candidate concern, a fairer competition and thus, that fairer competition constitute a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.713" offset="1523566">We need not speculate what might have happened to our requirement for votes because of what actually did happen in Texas after the La Raza Unida candidate secured the necessary signatures and attained ballot position in the 1972 Primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.215" offset="1593574">They polled more than 2% of their vote for their gubernatorial candidate in 1972 and consequently they -- the Texas legislature in meeting in its next biennial session raised the quota from 2% to 20% for automatic ballot position from this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.338" offset="1674136">And so the numbers gained does prevail in Texas and if one minority party happens to fulfill the requirements of that then law, then they’ll change the law again.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.311" offset="1718021">And actually, that was the difference that was made in the law in this 1345 subdivision (2) after the 1968 campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.668" offset="1751458">When the American Party started to where it said there is a competitive factor in Texas and so the law was changed and so we got this Honors petitions which we are now required to circulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.499" offset="1802762">This is the basis of the third exclusion from the ballot in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.411" offset="1822407">If the gubernatorial candidate did not receive 2% of the vote which is now been raised to 20% of the vote in the last general election, you have to go out and start the petition route again.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.415" offset="1874442">Of course, this presumes that you had a gubernatorial candidate, it would also include new parties like the Texas New Party and the Texas Socialist Workers Party which did not have a candidate on the ballot of any kind in 1970 and was not organized on a statewide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.166" offset="1949362">We have a statutorily dictated statewide organization in Texas for new, the Minority Political Parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.169" offset="1985411">Early as November preceding the general election, we are required to file a notice of intent to nominate by a convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.569" offset="2019056">In January, all candidates must file for office on that ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.050" offset="2036924">By March, the state rules must be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.198" offset="2049567">In May, the county precinct conventions must be held at the same time as the party primary conventions are being held and suddenly the whole Texas totalitarian idea takes on the very reflections of Williams versus Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.949" offset="2120516">The petitions which are required in Texas are statutorily dictated and exacting in wording.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.953" offset="2148519">The wording must be exactly as it is dictated by statute or they are not accepted and filed by the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.475" offset="2178612">The form is dictated, the form of the signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.757" offset="2191778">Prior to the holding of the precinct conventions through out the 254 counties in Texas in May, there must be printed and circulated these petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.957" offset="2236604">This is the first step for qualification for ballot position by the numbers gained in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.518" offset="2262831">They must be circulated, they must be in the hands of this precinct chairman in each of the precincts so they will be available for signature on that day because beginning as of that day, you have a total of 54 days as in 1972, it might be 55 days next year to secure 1% of the total vote for Governor in the proceeding general election to sign this petitions to indicate the support for some candidate who might be running on this minority party ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.568" offset="2407027">This number in 1972 with some 22,000 plus signatures in 1974 will be 36,000 plus signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.006" offset="2444748">But these petitions is not only must be in this exact form but they must be signed before a notary public and they carry a criminal penalty that you must have -- you must swear that you have not participated in any of the other party primaries in anyway whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.198" offset="2517577">You have already been excluded from the absentee balloting and it is the contention of the minority parties hereon appeal that certainly if you are to put out a petition after the primary, we should also be accorded the right to compete for those absentee votes and there are many thousands of absentee votes cast in Texas in each election.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.065" offset="2833032">But in 1968, it was a simple matter by comparison for a minority party to get on the ballot and that was the method that was followed by the American Party to secure ballot’s position.</text>

            <text syncTime="706.334" offset="2902100">Much more difficult sir and actually the legislature in Texas meets every two years and it seems that the election code changes every two years to meet the threat of the minority party or the independent or the competing party just as the changes been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.775" offset="2967824">Now the 1972 McKool-Stroud Act for the purpose of state financing of party primaries was a one year statute and it was thought that the 1972 legislature would change the elections laws to provide for the whole new primary elections procedure but since they did not do so, they did have to pass another financing bill which is the Senate Bill 11 which has been filed by the American parties in supplemental appendix and they provided in that apparently to pay for the major party primaries in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.463" offset="3130619">But it just happened to incidentally changed 1345 subdivision (2) again to require that to maintain ballot position after 1974 that the party would have to poll 20% of the votes for Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.737" offset="3191745">Of course it’s foreseeable that this could result in active campaigning by those who are now on the ballot to the point that some one of the three might even be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.654" offset="3243363">The fourth exclusion from the ballot is probably what is recognized in Texas as the least competition to the major parties and that is the exclusion of the independence and the nonpartisan candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.748" offset="3295713">It is the contention of Mr. Laurel Dunn who was the candidate for United States Congress that the requirement of the petition in addition to the United States constitutional specified qualifications for United States Congress is actually the super added idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.894" offset="3372304">The petitions are super added to the qualifications as was distinguished by the candidate's commentaries on constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.945" offset="3404487">This of course is the Powell versus McCormack suit which earlier had been decided as to Powell’s additional qualifications or the attempt to exclude him from the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.417" offset="3470420">It is the contention of the appellants that the statutory exclusions from the ballot in Texas result in constitutional unjustifiable equity -- inequities.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.032" offset="3520888">We don’t believe that there is anything in the record whatsoever by which the State of Texas even attempts to justify these exclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.085" offset="3561117">Whereas the compelling state interest for the deviation from these constitutional guarantees that any voter can effectively participate in the election for the candidate of it -- his choice as compared to being compelled to participate in either the -- of the two major parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.174" offset="3641469">The size of the ballot falls on their fears when we realize the numbers of the candidates who each year file in the Republican and Democrat primaries for the office of the Governor and the other controlling offices in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.303" offset="3701969">This is particularly true since this Court has overturned the filing fees requirement in the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.378" offset="3834253">It is not required to be held but if we are to secure the signatures as are required then the ballots -- the petitions, pardon me, must be distributed to each of these precincts and be going at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.359" offset="3894230">They -- the requirement becomes more obvious if one desires to participate in the primary and that the attendance at the county convention is limited to those who attended the precinct convention not to those who have signed the petition and then the appendance of the state convention which nominates on the statewide level is limited to those who attended the county convention which of course has been limited by the precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.036" offset="3996944">So actually, to have any voice in the minor political party in Texas, it is necessary that you attend the precinct convention and make your voice heard there so you can attend on up the role.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.641" offset="4055353">And it’s these continuous requirements by a statute of what we must do that makes it practically impossible to attain ballot position in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.709" offset="4195579">It is to be noted from the record that the Republican Party did not even hold party primaries in every county in Texas since we do have so many counties and some of them don’t indicate any interest in the Republican Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.962" offset="4260571">So those particular persons, if they did not participate in the Democrat primary and there was no offering of a precinct convention by the American Party, then they were totally without a vote in Texas in 1972.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Hainsworth</label>
            <text syncTime="1149.456" offset="4674560">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.063" offset="4692950">I am here today to speak in behalf of the appellant Hainsworth and also in behalf of those others we have endeavored to become independent candidates in the State of Texas over the years and have not quite been able to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.639" offset="4771318">To become an independent candidate in Texas, one has to meet the requirements of Article 13.50 of the Texas Election Code which provides among other things that the candidate must obtain a certain percentage of the votes of a certain number of the people who cast the ballot for governors both Democratic and Republican at the last preceding general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.634" offset="4955324">In addition to that, if the candidate is from a one county district, he has to get 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.201" offset="4997538">If the candidate is from a district composed of one or more counties, then the candidate is only required to get 3% of the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.840" offset="5040065">So there is some variance even with respect to candidates depending upon the number of counties in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.507" offset="5082802">In addition, the independent candidate has to obtain notarized signatures from each sign or of his application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.967" offset="5148630">And in addition to that, the independent candidate is proscribed in making his efforts to canvass for signatures in that those who have participated in the first primary, either Democratic or Republican and those who have voted in the second primary, a row of primary but not eligible to be canvassed by the independent candidate for that particular office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.270" offset="5289796">Provided, anybody has been a candidate in those primaries, there were two primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.410" offset="5314351">That in effect limits the independent candidate to about 50% of the voters in his district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.467" offset="5354580">Now the appellant in this case was a candidate for state representative in District 24 -- District 2886 and this particular county is a single number district and they are approximately 23 to 24 single member district in Harris County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.967" offset="5444650">Now, approximately 74,000 75,000 people in each state representative district and it is difficult to beat those requirements of the state statute, Article 13.50 in order to qualify as an independent candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.685" offset="5527510">In addition, another difficulty is the requirement that you must get those signatures within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.190" offset="5565544">Thirty days after the close of second primary day which usually comes about 3rd of July dated 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.183" offset="5613505">The three-judge District Court in deciding the consolidated cases stated in its opinion that this consolidated cases fell in between Williams versus Rhodes and Jenness versus Fortson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.039" offset="5700859">In that the Supreme Court in the Williams case was working on one end of the spectrum and in the Fortson case they’re working on the other and that the facts in these consolidated cases now before the Court fell exactly in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.739" offset="5771703">However, it seem to me that the Jenness case was the one that the three-judge District Court should have applied in making its decision because in that particular case are laid down some rules and possibly it may be stated that the State of Georgia had set forth the requirements they did consider appropriate for independent candidates and it may be that they were very, very liberal but it seems to me that they were very, very fair and I would like to submit to the Court that they should give considerations here as consideration to following the Jenness case in its requirements insofar as independent candidates are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.793" offset="5979951">In that particular case, no notary public was required in that particular state insofar as an independent candidate was concerned in getting on the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.741" offset="6955677">If the notarization provision is there and if I could wait for any independent candidate could wait 60 days, you get the 500 signatures but when you have to have it notarized, you only limited to 30 days and then you exclude it from those who voted democratic and republican primaries or you cut so far down and you don’t know who to go to, you have to go from house to house and may have voted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.561" offset="7427030">It’s all coming out of his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.649" offset="7435389">In latter times, the Democratic Party candidate or Republican Party candidate don’t have any opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.641" offset="7471334">Once they get good nomination, which in many cases tantamount to election, where they are in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1862.201" offset="7525564">So all they have to do is struggle to get on the primary ballot as the nominee and then they are just about in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.300" offset="7557956">But lots of times the -- they may have an opposition candidate in the primary and none in the joint election and then they may not have even a opposing candidate in the primary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.369" offset="7714273">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.572" offset="7730991">I want to first thank Mrs. Svanas for filing an appendix with this Honorable Court in which she very promisingly asked that the governor signs Senate Bill 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.684" offset="7779474">I filed that as an appendix with the Court saving us the trouble of doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.051" offset="7800999">I think it speaks very clearly for itself and we have not elaborated by any additional brief but with reference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.340" offset="7838093">Second thing, I would like to say that particularly, after listening to him although I have known him in Houston that our Texas admires independent candidates and we want people like Mr. Hainsworth to stand if they desire as independent candidates and I think our laws have accordingly allowed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.084" offset="7937045">I need to speak if I might for a moment factually to the American Party situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.366" offset="7966198">This party of course with a very valuable political force in 1968 in our state with over 91,000 signed up members and they cast 584,269 votes for George Wallace for President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.571" offset="8039027">Now since the American Party elect did not, for reasons of their own, to fill a governor nominee in the 1968 General Election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.043" offset="8088869">That party in 1970 was required under our statute to nominate candidates for state and local offices for the general election by conventions and when the party did not file with -- more required and my represent I set the state sufficient certification to indicate the minimum support that our statutes covering these matters contemplate something in the neighborhood as 22,000 conventioneers or if that many people don’t get to the convention, we permit supplementation by petition which we regard as a helping hand not as a deterrent and add on in addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.830" offset="8284056">For reasons that I frankly don’t know and I understand and the record is sailing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.463" offset="8306625">They just simply had 6,828 names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.395" offset="8326374">Whether they were -- that was because of their tremendous and the Court can take judicial knowledge of their great participation in the Democratic Party are not, I did not know, but those are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.626" offset="8403278">Now the new party, on the other hand, represents truly just what it is, a new party at Texas New Party we don’t know very much about it, we’re not told very much about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.449" offset="8450508">This Court is not told much about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.706" offset="8463569">Made no effort at all under this record to have any compliance and that’s where that matter stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.408" offset="8514351">The Socialist Workers Party did comply with our laws and they were on the ballot and they’re -- while filing a brief here, are not here at least verbalizing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.967" offset="8584568">And I don’t know of any substantial complaint that they raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.085" offset="8613094">Well, as for Unida who took no appeal from this matter and we are part -- we are state of many minority parties today, just a proof for the putting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.730" offset="8667638">We have a very fine gentleman for a governor, he received a very good vote and they qualified under the 2% and I’ll discuss how our procedure works in a little more detail in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.327" offset="8742034">And then Mr. Ronald Dunn who was an independent candidate for the United States House of Representatives and represents himself and before the independent candidate made absolutely no attempt to meet the requirements of our statute with reference to independent candidates and simply filed suit shortly after the primary elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.358" offset="8826149">Of course he has a perfect right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.861" offset="8840150">Mr. Hainsworth did try.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.468" offset="8858645">Had he not obtained for reasons that I am sure the Court has heard here and whether that represent inability of what we can’t judge, it’s a peculiarly within probably in his mind but nonetheless his 328 fell short of the 500 which we believe is not an owner’s burden and one that many has met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.908" offset="8980376">He filed a suit attacking the constitutionality of these provisions in a very candid and open way that he had displayed here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.770" offset="9023843">Now, we were faced in Texas, of the last session of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.670" offset="9043383">With this situation we will face with Williams as we could read it and understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.196" offset="9073580">And we will face with Jenness as best we could read it and understand what this Honorable Court, we are saying to the state in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.388" offset="9118302">We had read Rosario versus Rockefeller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.390" offset="9134289">But we had here three cases in which this Court, the majority of this Court had been heavily involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.105" offset="9161143">In addition to that, you had written Bullock versus Carter arising from our state involving our financing situation of our filing fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.558" offset="9207014">If I might, in that text -- in that context, discuss with you for a moment Senate Bill 11 that’s here as in the appendix which was passed and signed by our Governor in June, the 15th of this year, it provides, one, a schedule of filing fees that we believe are in keeping with the rules of reasonableness permitted at Bullock versus Carter much less than before, much legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.686" offset="9319445">Not here under attack and permitting the filing of a candidate of a nominating petition in lieu of the payment of filing fees which we believe is very progressive in keeping with Carter versus Bullock and not here under attack provides perspectives --</text>

            <text syncTime="3910.399" offset="15718296">The ultimate nominating petition provided that 2% of the vote cast for Governor of the party in the last preceding general election would be sufficient in that area for the person to get on the party primary balloting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.539" offset="15802932">And it should be at least 25 signatures but not to exceed 300.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.715" offset="15831562">I would like to make this distinction that the 5% of the persons who voted in the area applies in the Article 13.50 to all who cast a vote for governor in the last preceding general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.139" offset="15925290">You may have a democratic and republican running or some other candidate under another name but you add all of those in together to get the 5% in that particular area or district whereas the party -- primary nominee only has to get 5% of the -- no not 5%, only 2% of the total number of votes cast for the governor of his party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.208" offset="16057574">So it’s maybe down the 25 and it maybe but it’s not to exceed 300.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.262" offset="16081816">And if the major party back to Republican Court in Texas, if that candidate for governor in this District only gets 1000 votes, 2% of that would be about 20 and that would put him in the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.810" offset="16143987">Now, with respect to notarization under the old law with respect to party primary candidates, that was nothing said in it about notarization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.806" offset="16196023">So I presume that they could have that petition signed without having it notarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.123" offset="16225280">Is all -- they also provide it that they had 90 days to get those signatures to party primary candidate but the independent candidate on Article 13.50 only has 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.410" offset="16278361">Now, the Honorable Attorney General Mr. Hill was talking about both minor party -- minor parties and independent candidates and there is some distinction between those two.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.845" offset="16360176">Now an independent candidate in order to get on the ballot has to have 5% of the votes cast in that area or district for that particular office whereas the minor party candidate only has to get 1% only 1% of a vote cast either for a general -- for governors throughout the state or for whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.221" offset="16461636">But he is only has to get 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.518" offset="16470831">Now the independent candidate only had to get 1%, that would be just fine but they have made it 5% and when you add in 30 days limitation and notarization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.790" offset="16519941">I submit to the Court that there is too large of burden placed upon the independent candidate.</text>
