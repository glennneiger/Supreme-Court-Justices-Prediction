            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">Mr. Kelly, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert V. Kelly</label>
            <text syncTime="2.864" offset="88189">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.132" offset="97280">Briefly as to the factual matters Drucker &amp; Falk is a real estate insurance and property management firm that operates in Eastern Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.567" offset="135001">It manages one and two-storey apartment projects, the smallest of which is probably in the 30 to 40 unit area and they run up to units that are covered under the act and not a part of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.015" offset="196859">Each project is separately owned, each owner has an independent contract with Drucker &amp; Falk as to the management of the premises and as its -- as to its services and the contracts generally call for Drucker &amp; Falk to manage through resident -- to manage their property and manage the maintenance by Residents Maintenance Superintendents.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.309" offset="305946">They are all maintenance employees in each project that are on the payrolls of the owner of the project who stay at that project in the main with some very unusual exceptions and in effect, go with the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.135" offset="373238">It’s the position of Drucker &amp; Falk in this case, that the Secretary of Labor has taken an illusory and strain definition of the Fair Labor Standards Act to reach down and include the employees of the apartment projects as covered under the Act where they could not reach down, two of them except through the rental agent and that they thereby bootstrapping themselves in the coverage where it does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.684" offset="511478">Factually as presented here, unless you include the gross rental income as income of Drucker &amp; Falk, there would be no coverage under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.648" offset="571350">In addition, unless you include the employees who work after projects then there is no coverage of Drucker &amp; Falk under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.701" offset="611579">It is our position that you have to strain and come up with illusory result in order to include the rental income and include the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.711" offset="663615">It is our position with the first matter of income that income to Drucker &amp; Falk is the gross commission, therefore, our six commissions on the rentals and that that is the measure of their sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.163" offset="737384">It’s our position, therefore, that what they are selling is services and that what they get paid for the services is their commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.230" offset="773642">And it’s our position that you look at this from two different -- three different directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.903" offset="796317">One, you look at the provisions of the statute with regards to what is sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.520" offset="818782">You can look at the intent of Congress with regards to what is sale, or you can reach, look at the legal conclusions that you come to after applying common law principles to the facts involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.207" offset="869564">First, with regard to the statute itself, the statute has a definition of sale, as the Court is well aware which says that the sale is a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.250" offset="905718">It is in any sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.164" offset="909375">It says a sale is any sale, exchange, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.872" offset="948245">The statute goes on further to say that an enterprise is covered and that enterprise is any enterprise whose, whose annual sales, and I emphasize the ‘whose’.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.579" offset="999027">Volume of sales meets a test, which in this case is $500,000. Petitioners suggest to the Court that certainly the definition that I’ve read to you of sale does not cover what sale and this instance means.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.309" offset="1066005">Now, the Fourth Circuit found some comfort in the last three words which were “or other disposition”.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.565" offset="1102994">It’s our position that “other disposition” can only apply to a disposition of what you are selling, and what Drucker &amp; Falk is selling is their services, and the measure of that is the income to them, their commissions for the services, which they are selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.985" offset="1176660">The gross volume of sales made or business done is what is sold by the agent, his services.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.111" offset="1209156">He cannot sell for himself what is not his and what he sells for the owners is the owner’s sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.315" offset="1241966">And what the Secretary of Labor has tried to do is call the owner’s sale his sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.832" offset="1276029">So, under that definition, there is no definition which would include the factual situation presented to the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.283" offset="1317930">If we turn to the intent of Congress, I don’t think it’s even necessary to argue to the Court that it was -- that the congressional reports and the statements of the Secretary of Labor in amending the statute where such that the intent of Congress was to set the monetary limits with regard to what they felt was impact on commerce, the $500,000 in this particular instance, they felt was sufficient to be an impact on Congress and therefore you had bigness, and it was the intent of Congress to include the big and leave out the small.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.452" offset="1482606">If, by way of example, I could say it seems apparent that it was their intent to include the owner and his sales from the owner of the World Trade Center in Chicago, but not to include the owner of the Strip Center in Stony Creek, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.278" offset="1565884">And it seems to me, you have to strain and reach an illusory conclusion if you conclude that by happenstance, this strip operator in Stony Creek Virginia is employing a branch office of the real estate agent in Chicago who runs the World Trade Center and thereby, he is in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.237" offset="1657731">That’s a strained conclusion which is contrary to the obvious intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.372" offset="1698273">Thirdly, if we turn strictly to common law principles, it seems to the petitioner that the rentals do not fit any definition that would say that, that was the gross sales of the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.472" offset="1762638">The rentals do not belong to Drucker &amp; Falk; they belong to the apartment project owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.290" offset="1789910">The Drucker &amp; Falk does not control the property, nor the rentals except as agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.186" offset="1829512">The rent which is collected is not theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.647" offset="1839334">It’s put in a trust account in and out, and they spend it in an even strong -- even more -- a fiduciary position rather than a dead end creditor position, because they hold those sums in trust for the owner whose income is the rentals and not that of Drucker &amp; Falk.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.884" offset="1924284">And the sums are the distributed, we would suggest, under the direction and control of the owner and not of Drucker &amp; Falk.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.549" offset="1966916">On this issue, the Courts of Appeals have given that theory hard going, haven’t they?</text>

            <text syncTime="479.464" offset="1994606">Well, yes sir, but I don’t think there was any basis for giving it hard going.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.262" offset="2021773">They -- actually the Court of Appeals decided in the main based on the Wirtz versus First National Bank in which they say that in that case, it was concluded that rental income is sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.169" offset="2069420">And I have no problem with that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.940" offset="2076526">I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.194" offset="2081541">It’s a question of whose sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.367" offset="2090214">I don’t mean just the Fourth Circuit; I mean all of Courts of Appeals who have been decided, didn’t have go the other way, am I correct or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="510.106" offset="2117172">Well, it’s honorably set by two in the Wirtz on the same principle, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.162" offset="2133368">That -- the case is that a number of cases, which I would suggest do not apply in this case, have ruled and if you look at either one of the cases, you see that they summarily dispose of it by saying, it has already been decided in the such and such case that rental income is sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.655" offset="2227409">And I have no argument that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.886" offset="2236291">There’s no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.613" offset="2243187">The question is whose sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.423" offset="2254472">And we are saying that it’s the sales of the owner, not the sales of the petitioners in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.351" offset="2618201">His advisory help -- may help the owner to get his sales in but the Courts of Appeals went off on these cases saying, we’ve already decided that this is sales and did not consider the question of whose sales and the statute says, an enterprise who sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.371" offset="2730214">And you have got to define those sales and we suggest on the common law principles that these sales or selling what you have to offer which in the case of Drucker &amp; Falk is its services as a managing agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.662" offset="2787370">Now, the other position that we have taken in the case is that, it was improper to consider the employees who were working at the projects as maintenance people maintaining the project employers of Drucker &amp; Falk.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.165" offset="2849437">It is our position that they are employees of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.915" offset="2868454">They work for the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.173" offset="2873469">He is their -- he pays their bill, their wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.219" offset="2897607">He keeps their records.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.369" offset="2902204">He turns in the reports that need to be taken and that the employee is the employee of owner, of project, and not the employee of Drucker &amp; Falk.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.295" offset="2949956">And we say this knowing that there is a definition in the statute which says that an employer includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.984" offset="3024666">And we do not deny that Drucker &amp; Falk fits that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.148" offset="3049326">They are an employer under that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.137" offset="3065313">But you must go further than that under the Act. Because that’s just the definition what the access is under the 6 (a) and 6 (b), every employer shall pay to each of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.753" offset="3127798">Under 7 (a), shall employ any of his employees and we suggest to you that the way -- we admit that he fits the definition of employer, but we say to you that he is not -- the employee is not his employee when you are talking about Drucker &amp; Falk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.169" offset="4533394">And in each instance, there have been unanimous decisions in favor of the Government’s position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.994" offset="4680725">In the case of the employment issue, you have the Second Circuit’s decision in Arsenal Building and you have rather significant decision of the DC circuit in the Herbert Harvey case which I will get to when I discuss the employment issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.237" offset="8265665">The banks of volume of business are not in anyway measured by deposits that is not considered a sale by the bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.870" offset="8368274">Similarly with a law firm, they are not selling the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.261" offset="8381753">All they are selling are their services in connection with the loan and therefore, you measure it by their fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.788" offset="8419892">Now, the fact that a big and a small business are associated together in an enterprise, as here petitioners and their business of managing and renting real property and the building owners and their business of investing money in real estate, it is true that the building owners standing along will be exempt that there is not uncommon to have an exempt, a non exempt person in a joint enterprise, in a joint relationship with an employee and therefore the employee is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.237" offset="8549669">The purpose of the Act, is to protect employees who are happen to be employed in enterprises that are large enough to come within the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.728" offset="8587703">The fact that they may also be employed at the same time in a smaller enterprise is no basis for exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.847" offset="8616124">That’s established by the Herbert Harvey case for instance which is a Labor Board case, but involved the same issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2477.707" offset="9987553">What Mr. Kelly did not point to which we also attach considerable weight to is the definition of employ in Section 3 (g), which is to suffer or permit to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.015" offset="10040842">Now, who is it who suffers or permits these employees to work?</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.928" offset="10092460">The only connection that they have with these people is approval of an overall labor budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.795" offset="10119941">As far as the record discloses and from the contract that appears, they don’t even have the right to exercise a veto over the hiring and firing and so on as was the case in Arnheim &amp; Neely.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.886" offset="10260271">But when you say who pays them, the arrangement that the building owners have with the management company happens to provide for their payment by the building owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.344" offset="10490149">I’m not sure they would be materially different case if the employees were paid by the management company which in turn took off cost plus kind of a fee to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.554" offset="10542916">In our view, that would make no significant difference on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.965" offset="10564650">Now, well we’ve – I’ve adverted to the reality of the economic relationship between the management company and the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.354" offset="10622119">I’d like to point out which is very important that these people are not simply employed in the building owner’s enterprise which is real estate investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.778" offset="10659840">They were also employed in a very real sense in petitioner’s enterprise which is the management of buildings for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.845" offset="10688157">Petitioners could not conduct their enterprise, if they did not have these janitors, these elevator operators, these maintenance personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.797" offset="10719922">So, to say that they are not employed in a meaningful sense in petitioner’s enterprise, I think it is completely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.616" offset="10747193">Now, I think the Court was troubled or perhaps at least petitioner’s counsel was troubled by the notion that you might have all these different employers under the definition of employer in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.380" offset="10806230">Now, I think that a case could be made out that Congress intended to permit multiple liabilities not in the sense, Justice Stewart that you could recover more than once for the statutory liability but in the sense that there might be several jointly liable individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.324" offset="10886060">However, the McKay case, carved out which is the Eighth Circuit case which is discussed in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.688" offset="10911451">Carved out what in effect is the fellow servant exception that says that “Well, if the person who you are looking to does not have his own independent business enterprise, but is simply an employee, that is a supervisor or head of the personnel office or somebody like that, you cannot hold him independent liable."</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.382" offset="10994312">We’re not dealing with that case at all here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.606" offset="11003193">We’re dealing with an independent business enterprise to which these employees are vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.405" offset="11042377">Now, there was a question asked to the owner’s liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.868" offset="11060245">The owners in this case would be considered unquestionably liable, derivatively because they also employ these individuals who are employed in petitioner’s enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.464" offset="11110609">That is if the Court were to conclude that these individuals are covered under the Act by virtue their employment in petitioner’s enterprise which is of sufficient size then the building owners would be liable not for all of petitioner’s employees but for those who were employed at the owner’s own building.</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.345" offset="11798152">Yes sir, if I may take a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.811" offset="11811944">The Court understands that we don’t agree that the First National Bank case or the Jernigan case either one are applicable, though, counsel asserts that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.287" offset="11849874">The First National Bank case, the defendant bank owned the building and rented it through a management company that was the wholly owned subsidiary of that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.070" offset="11889058">As a matter of fact, as I recall the facts, the present company drew $50,000 a year from the bank as salary and $1800 a year for the management firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.592" offset="11931167">That was strictly an ownership case where they proceeded against the owners of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.587" offset="11951125">And the Jernigan case is again a proceedings against the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.302" offset="11965962">There, the operator of the restaurant service station facilities with the bus depot owned it and the Court concluded that he spent the greatest portion of his time operating the bus station and that’s where you are with the gasoline cases that counsel refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.753" offset="12031791">There, you have sued the owner who is operating and in the business of selling the gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.423" offset="12058436">The problem that I find with the counsel’s argument is that he talks about sales of apartment, space, like you sell them everyday, like you move in a new tenant every, every Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.904" offset="12124369">Suppose we had an apartment project where there is no turnover during the entire year the contract of management, what has he sold?</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.300" offset="12169927">The rents come in each month, has he sold any space?</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.945" offset="12184555">Same persons there when he was employed and there when he left as managing agent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.323" offset="12202005">What has he sold them, is his services in managing the project and supervising the --</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.504" offset="12262713">When they come on as managing agent as an existing lease, they may want for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.024" offset="12284865">They don't sell a thing so far as space, they sell their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.037" offset="12308898">And you could have a project where you would never sell anything, but services if there was no turn over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.331" offset="12338051">That's the problem I have, and I was sit down, is that it seems to me, if you take all these theories of counsel as who is covered, that the judges, example on a District Court level where you had the lawyer who was managing the large estate that bought and sold stocks, bonds, assets, real estate, in the estate, and distributed the money, then had a total gross income that he covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.308" offset="12449959">Now, that’s not what the Act says and I don’t think it’s the intent of Congress that that be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.933" offset="12476500">I don’t think it’s the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.300" offset="12485904">That I think it is illusory, I submit to you to say that the impact of a 40-unit apartment project on Warwick Boulevard in the city of Newport News has one with more impact on commerce sitting there, with Drucker and Falk managing it, than would be managing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.675" offset="12567406">The intact impact of those 40 units sitting on Warwick Boulevard is whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.423" offset="12594469">And it don't impacted a bit more if I manage it or Drucker and Falk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.006" offset="12608784">It would be just managed not quite as well and we submit that the decision and the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
