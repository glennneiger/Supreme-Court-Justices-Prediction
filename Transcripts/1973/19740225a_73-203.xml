            <label>Mr. Aaron M. Fine</label>
            <text syncTime="50.390" offset="278256">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.482" offset="294661">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review its decision dismissing the action as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.088" offset="345130">The grant of certiorari requested the parties to brief and to argue in addition to the questions presented, a question of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.442" offset="386508">The other questions, include the manageability of the large class action, who must be given notice, who should pay for the notice and the scope of discretion of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.297" offset="437917">Turning first to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, jurisdiction was asserted on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.458" offset="466547">First of all, the Court in 1968 in reversing the District Court said that it retained jurisdiction and secondly, the defendants say that it has jurisdiction anyway under the Collateral Order Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.707" offset="531540">Originally, jurisdiction was assumed in the Court of Appeals under what became known as the “"death knell"” doctrine when the class action in the first instance was dismissed by Judge Tyler in the District Court, and on the plaintiff’s appeal, the Court of Appeals held that to dismiss the class action would in effect bring it to an end, and the class would never get any chance of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.444" offset="626521">Now, if the "death knell" doctrine was incorrectly decided, later when the case was decided on the merits by the Court of Appeals in what became known as Eisen II, when it said “We retain jurisdiction,” it would obviously have had no jurisdiction to retain, and the defendants concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.493" offset="706769">We however, adhere to our view originally expressed in our position to their petition for certiorari before this Court and the "death knell" doctrine came up for review, and that petition was denied, that it was soundly decided by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.859" offset="776150">Now it has been considerably eroded since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.740" offset="787749">For example, the Third Circuit in Hackett against General Host Corporation, rejected it entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.410" offset="818364">But what happened in Hackett I think shows how wise the Second Circuit was in adopting the "death knell" doctrine because after Hackett refused to hear the appeal in that consumer antitrust case brought by a and on behalf of purchasers of bread following a conviction for price fixing in the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.026" offset="900807">The case was dropped by the plaintiff, because it couldn’t proceed without having a class action to support it and consequently, the question of the class never got to be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.851" offset="960157">Our submission is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.032" offset="968829">We submit that while the Court of Appeals said in reversing the District Court, when the District Court dismissed the class action, that it retained jurisdiction, what it actually did was to relinquish jurisdiction because it reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.331" offset="1038106">And this is unlike cases where Court of Appeals may remand the record for further findings because the record before it is insufficient to enable it to render a decision and meanwhile, no decision is rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.509" offset="1090769">Here, a decision was rendered so that the court said it retained jurisdiction, but it really didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.164" offset="1117414">In fact, the defendants were so confused about their role that when they came up before the Court of Appeals for the final time, this time trying to reverse the District Court, because the District Court had sustained the class action in every respect, they didn’t know who they were, and they designated themselves as appellees even though they have lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.384" offset="1210305">So there is a complete paradox and anomaly, and the Court of Appeals having rendered this decision saying in fact that it retained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.974" offset="1244682">Turning to the collateral order doctrine under Cohen, that has no application for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.221" offset="1277597">First of all, the class action determination is, in the language of Cohen, but a step toward the final judgment in which it will merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.363" offset="1314168">Rule 23 (c) prescribes that judgment will be entered for/or against the class, as the Court recently noted in its opinion in American Pipe against the State of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.436" offset="1358472">And it is a step which has to be taken in every class action, because under Rule 23 (c) 1, the court is required as soon as practicable after the class action is brought to make the class action determination.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="334.696" offset="1415523">Well, then what you’re saying, is there any suggestion or are you suggesting that a circumstance can arise where the determination of the District Court on the class action is unreviewable because of the way it’s moved back and forth between the District Court and the Court of Appeals?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="aaron_m_fine" startTime="353.982" stopTime="417.563">
            <label>Mr. Aaron M. Fine</label>
            <text syncTime="353.982" offset="1492637">I think it’s unreviewable at this stage of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.574" offset="1503086">As a matter of fact, the Court of Appeals reached out to decide all sorts of questions that were only tentatively decided by the District Court that were not ripe for decision, and that should have awaited a complete record in the District Court in the same way as many decisions of the District Court are not reviewable in initial stages of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.540" offset="1590857">And in any event, as Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out in his concurrence in the State of Utah case, Rule 23 specifically provides that the order of the District Court sustaining the class, or even denying the class maybe altered or amended prior to decision on the merits, and Judge Tyler in fact said in his opinion on which he was reversed here that the response to the kind of notice that he had ordered might prompt him to change his mind and disallow the class, so that this is the kind of order that Cohen certainly doesn’t contemplate will be reviewed now, because it might be changed.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="417.563" offset="1746965">Mr. Fine, was Cohen the basis for the Court of Appeals holding an Eisen I that it had jurisdiction to review Judge Tyler’s original order?</text>

            <label>Mr. Aaron M. Fine</label>
            <text syncTime="427.394" offset="1786358">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.133" offset="1789283">Cohen and Gillespie, they held there that this was in effect something that would irreparably harm the class, because this was the only way the class could get review.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.528" offset="1830870">It’s like the case where an attachment is released and unless there’s immediate review, the object of the attachment maybe gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.750" offset="1859709">But here, the Congress is that the defendant's preserve their right to review, which the plaintiff didn’t have in Cohen, and wouldn’t have had if the "death knell" doctrine hadn’t been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.473" offset="1922612">The defendants at the end of this case, when judgment is entered will have the right to review on all of these questions, and at that point it could very well be that Judge Tyler will have modified his order, will have reduced the class, might have eliminated the class entirely, changed it in many possible ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.833" offset="2028042">Well, that’s no different, Your Honor, from discovery orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.402" offset="2042358">For example, in TWA against Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.268" offset="2053851">The defendant there was ordered to comply with discovery which the defendant said would cost in the petition for certiorari are filed in this Court $5 million, but nevertheless, the discovery order, as all discovery orders are held to be, was held to be interlocutory and not appealable, and --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="510.939" offset="2120516">Well, do you think that’s quite the same as requiring the defendant to advance the costs through notice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="aaron_m_fine" startTime="516.816" stopTime="571.838">
            <label>Mr. Aaron M. Fine</label>
            <text syncTime="516.816" offset="2144026">I think it is, Your Honor, because the rule doesn’t impose the burden of costs on the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.474" offset="2170671">It says the court shall direct notice to the class, and so it obviously, unless the court is the one that is supposed to pay for notice under that specific language.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.838" offset="2224065">It obviously gives the court the power to decide who should pay for the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.649" offset="2239321">And here, just like in a case where the defendant may be subjected to the cost on preparing to try an antitrust case have to pay for the transcript, have to pay for discovery, but under the antitrust laws, the plaintiff isn’t required and cannot be required to put up any security for those costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.824" offset="2308075">The defendant there as the defendant here has to look to whatever judgment is entered at the end of the case in its favor if such a judgment is entered, and collecting that judgment if it gets a judgment for costs that should not --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="571.838" offset="2364082">But your security for cause Mr. Fine, is traditionally when the costs are taxed at the end of the case, expenditures that you have incurred to your own travel, or your own pay to a court reporter, you maybe able to tax against the opposite party.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.886" offset="2432313">But it strikes me that it's similar to what the Chief Justice said, this isn’t quite the same thing as that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="aaron_m_fine" startTime="594.744" stopTime="709.839">
            <label>Mr. Aaron M. Fine</label>
            <text syncTime="594.744" offset="2455719">Well, Your Honor, I think there is some instances for example, where a master is appointed and the parties are required to advance the expenses of the master before the end of the case, and there may be a division I think under the equity powers, under Rule 54 (b) to allocate those costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.898" offset="2536385">But in any event, this is no different from the discovery cases from the standpoint of finality on appeal because you may recall that Hickman versus Taylor came before this Court, because Mr. Fortenbaugh, the Philadelphia lawyer who was asserting the privilege against producing his work products papers there, had to undergo a citation for contempt before he could get review. We are not at this stage in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.264" offset="2649757">The defendants have not said whether they will comply with the order or they won’t comply with the order and certainly, this is no different from the discovery cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.642" offset="2683298">For example, United States versus IBM which is before you on petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.801" offset="2707958">Until the defendants have taken some irrevocable step with respect to the order of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.612" offset="2735229">Suppose they say “We won’t put up the costs?”</text>
            <text syncTime="667.251" offset="2745783">Well, there are all sorts of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.683" offset="2755500">They might be held in contempt, in which case depending I suppose on whether it’s civil or criminal contempt under the IBM case, they might have a right to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.753" offset="2791758">On the other hand, the court might say, “Well, if they won’t put up the costs, we are going to say that this would have the effect of a Rule 23 class action even without notice to the class for certain results, for example, for binding the defendants as against the prospect of one way intervention, and so on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="696.972" offset="2864588">So that this is no different certainly from the discovery cases even if it were thought to be slightly different from the standpoint of the defendant’s advancing costs at this point, from the standpoint of finality.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.839" offset="2916101">Mr. Fine, what if we not only agreed with you, but went further and came to the conclusion that this late date that the "death knell" doctrine as developed in the Second Circuit is wholly inappropriate and improper, that there was no right to appeal whatsoever in Eisen I from the District Court’s first disposition of this case, what would be the result?</text>

            <text syncTime="769.427" offset="3154442">Now, I would like to point to another distinction in Cohen that involved the general applicability of a statute, and the question in Cohen as phrased by another panel of the Second Circuit in the Weight Watchers case was whether a decision will settle a point once for all as it did in Cohen, or will open the way to a flood of appeals concerning the propriety of a District Court’s ruling on the facts of a particular suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.314" offset="3250051">Now, the Court of Appeals here has held that in some cases, costs can be imposed on the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.167" offset="3281398">Cases where they may have a duty, for example, a corporation’s duty to its stockholders, but here, the Court of Appeals has said that in some cases, the District Court may impose cost in others and particularly in this case, they said it’s inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.893" offset="3344300">So what they are really doing is interfering with the District Court’s discretion depending on how they view the facts of a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.544" offset="3378887">Furthermore, turning really, not to the question of appealability, but advancing somewhat to the question of the propriety of putting the cost on the defense, here the District Court found in these findings were not upset by the Court of Appeals, because the court simply said the District Court didn’t have jurisdiction to make them, that the New York Stock Exchange had violated its duty under the Exchange Act to protect the odd-lot investors who are the class in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.819" offset="3499990">And the violation of that duty, in which it was aided and abetted by the other defendants, certainly is no different from the kind of duty were no less in scope than the duty which the Court of Appeals said could be the basis for putting costs on the defendants in another kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.114" offset="3573238">So for that reason, Cohen doesn’t apply because this is really a decision on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.061" offset="3601032">And many District Courts have routinely since Rule 23 was amended, allocated the costs between the parties without any thought that they were doing anything wrong, and the Court of Appeals here says in some cases they should be able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.264" offset="3657770">So that I submit that a general rule which this Court would be asked to apply, that in no case can costs be allocated, should not be adopted, and since the question of a general rule isn’t involved, the defendants had no right of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.570" offset="3951073">On the issue of manageability, it’s not an issue at all in class actions maintained under 23 (b) 102, which would be for example, actions for an accounting, for a trust fund, or here an action for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.410" offset="4006348">And the Second Circuit, just summarily, in its first decision where it reversed dismissal of the class action said this can’t be a (b) (2) action because the advisory committee note says that that doesn’t apply to situations exclusively or predominantly for the recovery of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.253" offset="4097776">Now, this case isn’t exclusively or predominantly for the recovery of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.068" offset="4117002">This case seeks and has sought from the very first in the complaint requests, very substantial injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.157" offset="4145424">For example, the SEC special study of the odd-lot markets which was the basis really for this case, found that an engineering firm Ebasco had concluded in 1955 that very large cost savings could be put into effect if the odd-lot defendants automated their operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.969" offset="4232673">And Judge Tyler found in July of 1972 that as of that date, those recommendations have not only not been implemented, they hadn’t even been considered, so there is still a substantial need for injunctive relief here to reduce the costs of the odd-lot defendants, because as the court found, reduction of those costs would necessarily have a beneficial result for the class, because it would mean that the odd-lot differential, which is the basis of this case, a charge that it was inflated and fixed in violation of the antitrust laws would necessarily be affected and reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.633" offset="4395259">Yet the Court of Appeals ruled out the (b) (2) action as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.758" offset="4419814">But manageability enters into the rule only under (b) (3) actions those that are what were formerly known as spurious class actions, but since your decision in the Utah case are known as truly representative suits like all of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.360" offset="4486165">And manageability in (b) (3) actions under the language of the Rule is only one factor to be considered in deciding whether the class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.656" offset="4547396">And here, the Court of Appeals said both in the "death knell" opinion and in the second opinion that the class action is the only feasible method for adjudicating this controversy, because the individual class members, like Eisen have such small states that they’re not going to come forward with individual suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.232" offset="4621688">And yet, having held twice that this is the only feasible method, and the rule saying that manageability is only to be considered in the light of whether the class action is superior to other available methods, the Court of Appeals dismisses it as the class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.027" offset="4684904">Aside from the language of the Rule itself, however, the difficulties of management which the Court of Appeals perceived in this action are just not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.977" offset="4732656">First of all, it didn’t even consider what the rule specifically provides and that is that you can have a class action on the common question of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.222" offset="4769646">That part of the class action is certainly sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.762" offset="4783752">But here, the District Court also found that gross damages can be determined that on the basis of a common formula, and estimated for the entire class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.815" offset="4820010">As a matter of fact, the odd-lot defendants know exactly what they charged to the class as a whole, because the charge was their income, and if the District Court is right that the formula can be adopted, then we know what part of that total charge, that aggregate charge was an over charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.913" offset="4888451">Now, certainly, as to the two million and the quarter class members whose individual transactions, the defendant stipulated are recorded on computer tapes and can be derived from those computer tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.891" offset="4948323">Constituting 56% of the transactions of the class as a whole, what is the difficulty in managing that if you have a formula that you can apply across the board?</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.276" offset="4993881">This is no different from the utility cases where refunds are routinely ordered when some rate is found to have been too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.966" offset="5028571">And in fact, in the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline case, the court pointed out that refunds were made to over a million ultimate consumers with reasonable promptness and without serious controversy under the supervision of a master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.597" offset="5087086">Similarly in the Illinois Bell Telephone case in the days when people have to copy records like Bob Crotchet sitting on a stool, and before the days of the computer, refunds were made of $17 million to over a million people entitled to the refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.509" offset="5146749">So if you have a formula, there’s really no great problem in managing, especially with the assistance of data processing, and from personal experience I know that these burdens do not fall necessarily on the court, they are assumed by counsel, by accountants, and by data processing firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.781" offset="5219892">And here, you have two and a quarter million class members who stand to receive and recover a tangible amount without undue difficulties of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.727" offset="5259703">But they have been put out of court, because the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded and held that Judge Tyler had said “That the only way that this class could be managed would be by the so-called fluid recovery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.898" offset="5320307">That is a future reduction of the odd-lot differential.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.925" offset="5520405">Now, it’s true that the plaintiff’s counsel suggested in the District Court that if six million class members have to go through that ancient records, and he said “In that narrow sense, it would be impracticable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.925" offset="5568470">So he suggested what became known as the fluid class recovery that is equitable relief, fashioning a remedy for future reduction of the odd-lot differential, and that would benefit certainly odd-lot investors as whole and those who overlapped the class who would pay the overcharge during the period in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.028" offset="5652898">The District Court didn’t adopt that saying only it merited consideration that individual claims could be satisfied to the extent filed, that the fluid class recovery might then be appropriate for distribution of the unclaimed remainders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.495" offset="5714756">And if you have the formula kind of distribution for those whose identities are on tape, then you may even be able to cut out a large part of the claims procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.126" offset="5805244">First of all, the defendants could say it should go back to them, and they will have the opportunity to argue that after judgment is entered as the rule contemplates for the total amount of damages for the class as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.976" offset="5860624">Secondly, it could be applied to reduce the odd-lot differential in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.211" offset="5889567">It could be done under the general equity powers of the court, which it certainly has under Case against Borak to fashion any remedy to make the Securities Act effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.883" offset="6008268">The Metro Homes case in Michigan was a class action where there had been an illegal exaction of a tax than held to be unlawful, and there the court held that the taxing authority had to pay over the entire amount and couldn’t get back any part of the amount illegally collected, even though individuals didn’t come forward to consume the entire amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.431" offset="6102518">So that what I’m saying is that although Bebchick was a different case, it provides part of the substantive law, the equitable principles on which the court can rely in fashioning a remedy whether the action is a class action or not a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.090" offset="6161136">It really makes no difference almost Mr. Justice Powell to make another answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.462" offset="6186632">Suppose notice goes out to the two million and then there is a judgment liability and the fund is created, they can then be told you have a refund due to you, and the same notice can be published for those who can’t be identified, assuming that they will read the notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.313" offset="6622041">Now, turning to individual notice, it’s not required in (b) (2) actions for an injunction and under the decisions like Hansberry and Lee, and Ben-Hur against Cauble, adequacy of representation is the hallmark of due process and class actions, not individual notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.844" offset="9284127">We believe that we at the Court of Appeals, had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.353" offset="9306175">Mainly because we have had from us extracted a sum of $19,000.00 or it is intended to be extracted from us to finance a case against ourselves, and if we are successful by the plaintiff’s own admission, no chance of recovering it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.978" offset="9380676">We have had inflicted upon us what we consider an illegal and unlawful mini-hearing, a truncated hearing on the merits prior to trial, and prior to jury trial which we have requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.566" offset="9438981">We have been subjected to, or we are told that we will be subjected to such inadequate notice that the rights of the class will be denied, that res judicata will be denied to us, that the chance of plaintiffs is opting out, plaintiff members or the plaintiff class opting out will be denied to us because of the inadequacy of the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.608" offset="9535216">We have also seen a misconstruction of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, as it applies to the odd-lot houses and a misconstruction of Section 6 of the exchange Act as it applies to the stock exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.805" offset="9591954">We submit that because of all these violent actions taken by Judge Tyler against us that this case comes clearly under the doctrine of Cohen against Beneficial Loan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.715" offset="10499657">It was a matter of first impression at that time, but it was a rule promulgated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.877" offset="10532258">And this Court indicated that it felt a responsibility to put at rest all the controversy under Rule 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.690" offset="10563500">Now, I don’t think that anybody can deny that the status of Rule 23 below is a mess, and I would hope that this Court would assume the responsibility now that we’re here before you with this case which has so many facets to it, I would hope that you would have assume the responsibility of deciding the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.165" offset="10657437">Now, if I may proceed to consideration, short brief consideration of the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.010" offset="10760777">Now, the enormity of this class, I know bothered Judge Medina, and I know it must bother every judge in the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.989" offset="10796722">Now, 6% of those people live abroad and speak foreign languages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.207" offset="10817620">The class is diverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.157" offset="10829427">I would refer probably I think the best affidavit on our appendix is rather of Mr. Smith of Merrill Lynch on (a) 53, in which he lists 25 different kinds of investors, by no means an exhaustive list, 15 types of orders which can be changed and interchanged in such a way that 15 isn’t the figure, but at many times 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.207" offset="10929528">It must be remembered that at all times, in this case, Mr. Eisen can sue in his own behalf.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.280" offset="11037884">The plaintiff in his reply brief states that the court’s finding regarding the defendant’s antitrust violations and Exchange Act 6 violations are not before this Court for review because they were not reversed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.865" offset="11128163">Well, my favorite reading is Judge Medina’s opinion, and I am very familiar with it, and I have found that in three different places, he has said that the findings and the rulings of Judge Tyler as to the merits of the case, in other words, our antitrust liability, the exchange of Section 6 liability are vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.387" offset="11226279">And he has also pointed out that under his opinion, Judge Tyler had no right to consider the merits, and I do think they are before this Court, and I say that and that they have been vacated and are of no effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Eldred Jackson</label>
            <text syncTime="3526.597" offset="14183131">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.724" offset="14199641">The basic issue in this case, and this was the basic difference between the Court of Appeals and the District Court, is the question whether a rule of procedure may be used to effect changes in substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.693" offset="14267559">The Court of Appeals, we submit, correctly held no, and in doing so it reversed District Court determinations, which were based on the premise that in the interest of liberal interpretation of Rule 23 and in the interest of punishing alleged wrongdoers, this case must proceed as a class action at any price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.778" offset="14371840">And the price, which the District Court exacted, was the bending and indeed the breaking of established constitutional and legal principles of substantive law, all in order to let Mr. Eisen act as the self-appointed champion of the rights of six million class members scattered throughout the United States and the free world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.297" offset="14481972">Now, Rule 23 was utilized to order substantive law in this case by the District Court, we submit, on the three points of notice which was woefully inadequate under the rule and under the constitution as Mr. Milburn has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.243" offset="14561698">Secondly, by the creation of the fluid recovery device for the class as a whole; thirdly, by the preliminary hearing on the merits followed by an order that the defendants pay forthwith without recovery, 90% of the cost of communicating with the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.029" offset="14648842">And these radical departures from substantive law were decreed by the District Court, because otherwise, the action was plainly unmanageable as a class action, as plaintiff’s counsel conceded at 196 of the appendix, when he urged a fluid recovery, because he said that if each of the six million class members had to present his own personal claim for damages, the class indeed would not be manageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.025" offset="14784888">Now, we submit, Your Honors that it’s really not at all significant that class actions had their origins in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.691" offset="14835461">They’re still procedural devices and that is the whole thrust of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.543" offset="14874958">Its purpose as can be divined from its face, and as appears from the notes of the revisers, which are printed at pages 18 in following of the supplementary appendix, was that Rule 23 was designed to provide a means of bringing together in a single forum, existing claims, large or small, of actual individual plaintiffs for the purpose of achieving judicial economy and efficiency, and uniformity of decision, where it is possible to do so without sacrificing procedural fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.106" offset="15053218">This rule, I submit Your Honors, confers no substantive rights on any litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.565" offset="15079027">The intended beneficiaries of this rule are the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.481" offset="15094700">The purpose is to avoid the multiple litigation of claims which otherwise would be litigated in different forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.328" offset="15126047">The purpose is to assist the judiciary and incidentally to reduce its case load.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.823" offset="15147990">There is nothing in Rule 23 or in its history about facilitating retribution for wrongdoers, alleged wrongdoers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.987" offset="15192712">There is nothing in the rule that tilts the scales for or against plaintiffs or defendants, as is assumed by some commentators and was assumed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.279" offset="15245897">Mr. Fine’s discourse on flexible remedies and his citation this morning of the Borak case as an example of the creativeness of the Federal judiciary in not letting wrongs go unpunished, rather misses the point, because all of his cases, including the Borak case didn’t each -- reach the question of creating a flexible or inventive remedy for ill-gotten gains, until after liability had been determined on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.176" offset="15393437">And those cases are not properly considerable in determining at the outset of a litigation whether the suit should be permitted to be maintained as a class action or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.303" offset="15449966">The rule of course, as this Court well knows, was promulgated under the Rules Enabling Act, which provides in very specific terms that such rules may not, shall not abridge in large or modify any substantive right and shall preserve the right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.477" offset="15546619">Now, in the pending of substantive law as to notice requirements, in that area I’d like to add a few words to what Mr. Milburn has already said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.236" offset="15621642">Mr. Fine has attempted to avoid the notice problems, indeed the manageability problems by suggesting that this case could well be a (b) (1) or a (b) (2) case, rather than a (b) (3) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.480" offset="15686635">Well, I think it’s significant that all judges who have considered this case, including Judge Tyler have agreed that this can only be regarded as a (b) (3) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.672" offset="15739402">Judge Tyler certainly found to this effect in his first opinion in 1966 at 95 of the appendix, in which he said that notice was required by the rule, and the rule of course requires notice in (b) (3) actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.561" offset="15807007">Beyond that, Mr. Fine seeks to put this case into the (b) (1) or (b) (2) category by arguing that it’s really an injunctive case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.950" offset="15864581">Well let’s look at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.728" offset="15875657">The injunction, the injunctive claims, claim for injunctive relief is appended to a claim for money damages, and what is sought to be enjoined by this complaint is the odd-lot differential which was established in 1951 and permitted by the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.832" offset="15960085">Now, since that time that differential has been twice changed, first, in 1966 at the express direction of the SEC to the New York Stock Exchange, and then later in 1972 by a rule of the exchange itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.541" offset="16038870">So it is evident I think, that the claim for injunctive relief in the complaint is now moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.919" offset="16068441">In any event, Judge Tyler in basing his estimate of damage claims in this case, for the period 1962 to 1966, did so by comparison with the 1966 rate as the proper rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.284" offset="16153913">So that it seems to us that the suggestion of this late date, that this is an injunctive case, flies in the face of the facts and in view of the obvious problems which this case creates for itself, because it’s essentially a money damage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.829" offset="16252029">Let me turn now to the --</text>

            <label>Mr. William Eldred Jackson</label>
            <text syncTime="4100.100" offset="16477100">Yes, Your Honor, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.169" offset="16497476">Turning to the next invention of substantive law which we believe to be completely unjustified by Rule 23 and its true purposes, I come to the question of the so-called fluid recovery for the class as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.161" offset="16573440">Now of course it’s a fundamental principle of our law that money damages are recoverable only by persons who are injured by illegal conduct who can prove damages flowing from such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.473" offset="16634671">And this principle is of course enacted in the Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which is here involved, any person injured in his business and property, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.184" offset="16677512">And the same principle of compensatory recovery is recognized in the line of cases which have construed Section 6 of the Exchange Act which is here alleged to be the basis for the exchanges' liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.216" offset="16741564">But, the plaintiff has conceded that this case could not proceed as a class action if this fundamental principle of substantive law were to be observed, if all class members were required to prove their damages, and it was on this basis in order to save the class action at all costs that the District Court ruled that it would make an award of damages to the class as a whole, that class members could file claims and prove their damages and if they did so, they could recover damages, but for the great bulk of the class as a whole, the differential would be reduced in the future until the total award was exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.367" offset="16942184">Well now, we submit, Your Honors, that there is no such thing as a class as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.930" offset="16976457">A class is not an entity which is entitled to collect damages in its own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.383" offset="17002266">A class is a collection of claimants, and that we think is the teaching of this Court’s decision in Snyder versus Harris at 394 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.811" offset="17052003">An award of damages to the class as whole by reduction of the differential in the future would do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.439" offset="17094531">First, it would benefit future purchasers and sellers of odd-lots who are not purchasers and sellers in 1962 to 1966, and thus not members of the class and thus not persons who are injured by any of the defendant’s allegedly illegal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.191" offset="17181466">And secondly, such a device would not compensate past traders who may not trade in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.395" offset="17222322">And furthermore, this device except as to those few class members who might file claims were denied to the defendants of their constitutional right to a jury trial on the damaged issues and I refer to this Court’s case decision in Curtis against Loether of last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.501" offset="17306749">In addition, what the District Court proposed here by way of a rate reduction in the future would plainly usurp the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC under the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.373" offset="17370279">Courts have no power to fix odd-lot rates in the first instance under the Congressional scheme of regulation of exchanges expressed in the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.940" offset="17424509">That function is confided to the SEC and the statute enacts standards which must be applied for rate making under its mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.988" offset="17472679">And the court’s injection of itself into this area of rate making is contrary to the long line of decisions of this Court which forbid judicial intrusion into areas reserved by statute for agency expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.679" offset="17543419">Finally, in the catalog of substantive law changes effected in the name of Rule 23, we come to the preliminary hearing on the merits, and the resulting order that the defendants should pay 90% of the cost of giving notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.444" offset="17630563">This of course, we believe to be a clear violation of the defendants Fifth Amendment rights to due process and their Seventh Amendment rights to a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="4420.746" offset="17759713">Now frequently, a court will, as a condition to allowing a deposition that they will require the defendant to advance the travel cost to be paid by plaintiff’s attorney's fees, is that so different from this?</text>

            <text syncTime="4436.870" offset="17824183">In the first place, this is not a poor man’s case, even though Mr. Eisen is not willing to pay the cost of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.561" offset="17851037">After all, he is an investor in odd-lots of stock on the exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.325" offset="17874024">But certainly, the analogy to the in forma pauperis case is not implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.686" offset="17907461">I’m quite aware that on occasion, courts do order the opposite party to advance certain costs, but those I don’t believe that this practice is generally resorted to where it’s apparent that the costs can never be recovered, as is the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.351" offset="17978201">We have a bill of cost in the Court of Appeals of some $11,000.00 which will never be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.762" offset="18007771">And I don’t think that it’s possible to say as Mr. Fine does, well this is no worse than discovery costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.562" offset="18039014">Everybody realizes that this is an incident of litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5169.443" offset="20754495">Now, secondly Mr. Jackson said that we change the substantive law by seeking judgment for the class as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.763" offset="20787827">Well, judgments for class as a whole are routinely entered in Securities Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.211" offset="20809561">In the Gerstle against Gamble-Skogmo case, there was a judgment for the whole class affirmed by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.948" offset="20836519">The question then is, after the judgment has been entered, who can make claims about against the fund and what should be done with any residue?</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.809" offset="20864000">That is something for later determination as I argued before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.214" offset="20881554">On the question of practicability governing the entire notice rule, our reply brief refers to an article by Professor Kathleen and other authorities who support this kind of notice in this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.025" offset="20932859">In fact, there is no commentary on the notice ordered by Judge Tyler, no scholarly commentary that I know of, which says that the notice is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.940" offset="20972460">Indeed, Judge Medina said that under certain circumstances, a publication may amount to the best notice practicable, particularly where requirement of a different form of notice would prevent potentially meritorious claims from being litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.781" offset="21027840">That’s the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.275" offset="21033900">I think it’s particularly ironic that the defendants say they can get the names and addresses from the tapes, but can’t get anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.462" offset="21062635">And the cost that they’re volunteering to undertake of generating the names and addresses from the tapes is more, according to their witnesses, than the cost that they would have to pay if they went in accordance with Judge Tyler’s notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.795" offset="21115925">In other words, they’re willing to pay more so that we can be put out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.378" offset="21134211">Now, I do think that public respect for the law must be considered, and just because these are small claimants as distinguished for example from the three million shareholders of AT&amp;T, who undoubtedly if they were a proxy violation affecting them, could come into court and presumably use the class action devise to protect their interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.689" offset="21211533">I think that the small claimant’s interests have to be satisfied just like those of the large claimants, or the claims of large individual corporations that can afford to come in and sue for violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.443" offset="21262524">Now, I refer by analogy to what Mr. Justice Stewart said in U.S. versus Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures that to deny standing, which is the analogy I draw here, would mean that the most injurious and widespread governmental actions could be questioned by nobody, we cannot accept that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.948" offset="21348519">Similarly here, we can’t accept the conclusion that the more widespread of violation of the antitrust or securities laws, and the smaller the resources of the victims, the less effective the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.135" offset="21405257">I think the defendants would like to be able to limit all classes to the 19th Century class approved by this Court in Smith against Swormstedt, which was described by the Court as consisting of traveling of the worn-out Methodist preachers, but in this day of mass frauds where we have the National Student Marketing case, and the Equity Funding case, and the Penn Central case, if you affirm the Second Circuit here, you may very well put tremendous obstacles in the ways of cases like that.</text>
