            <label>Mr. Aldus S. Mitchell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="57.551" offset="306991">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.870" offset="324232">I represent the Board of Election Commissioners of City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.839" offset="340114">Our case is here on appeal from a decision in judgment of a three-judge District Court, Northern District Illinois finding a section of Illinois Election Code unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.214" offset="389642">The section that’s involved is Chapter 46, Section 7-43 (d) of the Illinois Revised Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.292" offset="429871">That section provides that there can be changes in participation in political party primaries, only if 23 months has elapsed since the time that the voter has last participated in a primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.016" offset="512836">I think it’s important here that this Court understand that the territory of the Board of Election Commissioners of City of Chicago encompasses the City of Chicago and four suburban towns at the time that this case came to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.457" offset="574589">Those towns were the towns of Berwyn, Cicero, Stickney and Lyons.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.585" offset="595069">In addition, the City of Chicago is divided into 50 wards and in the 50 wards and the four suburban towns, there are approximately 3500 precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.306" offset="638015">What we have in this case is a single voter from the 36th precinct of the 50th ward of the City of Chicago, who brought in action claiming that Section 7-43 (d) of the Illinois Election Code deprived her of a right to participate in the primary election to be held on March 21, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.017" offset="744803">She filed a complaint asking that Section 7-43 be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.836" offset="784091">In that complaint, she alleged that she had voted in the Republican primary in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.456" offset="810527">The Republican Party primary for the Chicago Municipal Officers, that there was Section 7-43 (d) of the Code which prohibited her from voting in the March 21, 1972 Democratic Party primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.262" offset="889835">And she asked the Court to find that that section deprived her of rights guaranteed protected by the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.384" offset="934243">I think that this case presents two basic problems, two basic differences between the plaintiffs or appellants here and the defendant -- the defendants were appellants here and the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.229" offset="1013656">And that is whether or not the Courts, the Federal Court System has a right in every claim made by a voter to take jurisdiction and to decide that question on whether or not the Federal Courts are limited by the terms of the Constitution of the United States, particularly the Tenth Amendment, to those situations in which that is a demonstrated interference with a right that is granted by some other section of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.572" offset="1183033">I don’t think that there’s any question here that there is a right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.307" offset="1209992">But in the case that’s before the Court, the claim that there was a denial by any section of the Illinois Election Code is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.601" offset="1267148">What Mrs. Pontikes complains about is that she is not permitted to participate in primary elections and she sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.045" offset="1320960">The state of Illinois has seen fit to set up regulations which in there in fact as to protect the integrity of political parties and it is not just the integrity of the Democratic and Republican Party, but it is designed to protect the integrity of any political group which comes together and asserts itself under the terms of the Election Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.993" offset="1460767">The complaint that Mrs. Pontikes brought, we believe was insufficient to ward the District Court in undertaking to hear and decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.505" offset="1514789">The bare on its face, the most that she says is that she desires to participate in an election, a Democratic Party primary elections and that the section of the statute involved here would prevent her doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.826" offset="1592007">I think that a look at the statute discloses that that just is not true.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="387.825" offset="1628056">Mr. Mitchell, Judge Marovitz who was with you on the merits will disagreed with you on your procedural point here, did he, and agreed with the majority of the District Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="aldus_s_mitchell" startTime="397.875" stopTime="562.546">
            <label>Mr. Aldus S. Mitchell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="397.875" offset="1668284">Yes Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.900" offset="1680300">But we take the position that Judge Marovitz was wrong on the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.265" offset="1697855">This was a case that should never in which a three-judge court should never have been convoked because the complaint on its face was insufficient, to state of claim upon which relief could be granted in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.292" offset="1749891">There is certainly no claim here of any discrimination by the Illinois Election Code between the plaintiff and any other citizen in the state of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.707" offset="1795553">And there is no claim that there is any denial of due process as might have been involved in Williams versus Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.222" offset="1833587">It’s just the flat assertion that she will not be permitted to participate in the Democratic Party primary in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.158" offset="1877368">That’s statewide because she had participated in the primary election for Republican Party for municipal offices in the prior year within 23 months of the election that was to be held on March 21, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.262" offset="1965767">I think that there were a series of problems that were overlooked by the judge to whom the case was originally assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.825" offset="2019997">Even if you get passed the hurdle of whether or not the complaints’ states of claim upon which relief may be granted, I think you run head on into the question of whether or not it is a case that ought to be heard by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.533" offset="2082900">In Illinois, there had been an interpretation, a construction of the statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.491" offset="2134727">In Faherty versus Board of Election Commissioners in which the Illinois Court had decided that participation in a statewide primary would determine how you could participate, the party’s primary that you could participate in after the municipal office is left.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.119" offset="2225215">Now, I think that in the opinion of the District Court, they mentioned that they did not believe that the Constitution required or permitted that these people, that citizens, voters be locked in to a particular political party at every level of government or at every level of politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.458" offset="2322599">We do not argue --</text>

            <text syncTime="574.447" offset="2374531">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.220" offset="2389577">I think as we broke, I was speaking to the question of the complaint which had been filed by Mrs. Pontikes in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.359" offset="2434194">I had just suggested that she had not made any allegations in that complaint indicating that she claimed any denial of equal protection nor had she made any claim that the statute denied her due process of a sort that the Court had spoken to in William versus Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.708" offset="2515592">I think that this, the fact that these allegations were not made, very serious questions as to her standing to maintain the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.790" offset="2559896">I think that the Court for quite a long time and more recently in Jiggens versus McKeegan (ph) had decided that unless the person bringing the lawsuit could indicate in some fashion that they were going to be harmed and damaged in some way differently from the way in which the other members of the community would be harmed by the statute that they had no right to maintain a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.501" offset="2670759">I think that all of these are questions that were in the bosom of the judge to whom the case was originally assigned in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.173" offset="2709420">At the time that a motion was made to convene the three-judge court pursuant to the statute, I think that the District Judge at that point did not carry out his responsibility on the laws, the rules and the law by searching this complaint and deciding all of these questions before convoking that three-judge court, before asking the Chief Judge of the Seventh Circuit to convoke that three-judge court.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.217" offset="3305639">On pager 4, we did set out the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.565" offset="3327060">But we thought that those are necessarily included in the questions that we had set out in the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.278" offset="3377842">I think that once the question of the three-judge court had been presented to the District Judge and the Court had been convened that there were two questions that faced both the District Judge before the Court is convened and the Court at the time it was sitting and that was whether or not this was the sort of question that the statute 2281 had considered to be within the jurisdiction of the three-judge court whether or not this was a local question which should be decided by a single judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.791" offset="3547951">And if that question was answered in the affirmative, it was a local matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.991" offset="3568744">The three-judge court should have returned the matter to a single judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.974" offset="3592673">In this case, we have a single individual who is a resident of one precinct out of some 3500 precincts within the jurisdiction of the Board who claims to be affected by statute which on its face seems to show that there are some areas in the state of Illinois which will not be affected by the terms of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.911" offset="3716389">The jurisdiction of the Board of Election Commissioners in this case is limited to the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.972" offset="3760588">The other areas in the County of Cook do not have the Republican and Democratic Parties presenting candidates for election, for municipal office and we suggest that in that circumstance that this is the local situation, that is not included within the jurisdiction of the statutory three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.147" offset="3881378">But I think even more important, even if there is jurisdiction, I think the Court faces a further problem and that is the question of whether or not the Court should hear and decide the particular case that it is presented with.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.463" offset="3942609">We would suggest here that in the light of the fact that the Illinois Supreme Court had not considered this statute on the factual situation that was presented in this case, that this was a proper case before the Court not to construe that statute, but to allow the Illinois Courts to construe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.608" offset="4027141">The Illinois Court had considered the case -- considered the statute in the case of Faherty versus the Board of Election Commissioners in the City of Chicago in determining whether or not participation at the statewide primary level would determine the political party primary that a voter could participate in, in the municipal offices primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.098" offset="4121182">They had decided that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.080" offset="4129019">We suggest that that decision does not -- is not a decision or an indication that it would decide the adverse of that question that is the question of whether or not participation in a municipal primary which Mrs. Pontikes alleged here also prevents a change in political party primary when the statewide primary is being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.925" offset="4236434">These are questions that should be left to the Illinois Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.200" offset="4257541">I think that the Court has in numerous cases decided that where a statute is capable of a construction which would prevent the statute from being determined to be unconstitutional that the presumption should be that it will be construed in that fashion and the Courts that were primarily concerned with the statutory construction should be allowed to construe the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.147" offset="4365375">It was not done in this case though there is a ready means of that in the state of Illinois because there is a declaratory judgment statute and the Illinois Supreme Court has decided that election matters or matters which can be determined under that declaratory judgment action or declaratory judgment statute and under that statute, declaratory judgment matters were given preference over other matters that are pending in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.211" offset="4477597">So that this could have been quite rapidly done probably in time for a decision to have been made on the construction to be given to that statute before the election in all probability in time for the Federal Court to have considered the matter if the plaintiff felt that the construction was erroneous and left open the question of whether or not the statute was constitutionally deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.639" offset="4595252">We think that in these circumstances, the Court should have abstained and that the matter should be returned to the Illinois Courts so that they might consider the statute rather than having to live with an interpretation by a Federal Court which is not used to dealing with vagaries of the Illinois Election Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.676" offset="4699429">The statute here is a part of an integrated scheme for carrying on elections and on numerous other aspects of the elections -- of the Election Code that are affected by a decision that Section 7-43 (d) of the Illinois Election Code is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.355" offset="9510139">The city of Chicago has elected the Democratic American consistently since 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.138" offset="9529260">There are less than five Republican candidates that ever carried the city in any election at any time on a state or national basis since then.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.640" offset="9635318">I think what we held when we get to the middle of this issue is a conflict in rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.488" offset="9654648">We recognized the right of a state to regulate elections, the right of the state to protect with limitations, party integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.305" offset="9689966">But we also recognized the right to vote and it’s alleged in the complaint in paragraph 8 of the complaint which is found at page 4 of the appendix that plaintiff has been denied her right to vote by the application of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.996" offset="9748689">We say that this right, this right to vote must be held superior to the right to protect party integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.877" offset="9784216">In a case, which to the untrained eye, it might seem controlling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.421" offset="9806472">I think the Court anticipated that in Rosario.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.033" offset="9820891">The Rosario decision which interestingly was decided one year to the date after the primary which was affected by our case stated that the New York registration statute was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.828" offset="9868016">It was valid to require one, to register some 8 to 11 months prior to a primary in which primary he was going to vote but the majority said in that case that this was not “locking in” and that’s the language that’s used in that 93 Supreme Court page 1250, thus New York scheme does not lack a voter in to an unwanted preexisting party affiliation from one primary to the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.455" offset="9978567">All that the voter had to do in that case if he wished to vote in the primary of his choice was simply register 8 to 11 months beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.913" offset="10012421">There are many other states which has registration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.939" offset="10028513">California requirement which was by statute 56 days has just been reduced by Court to 30 days in the case of Gonass (ph) versus Young which I believed certiorari was denied on although I don’t have the citation with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.547" offset="10082952">In California, you register at the time you vote as either a Democrat or a Republican or you register as unaffiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.807" offset="10115971">You cannot vote in a primary unless you are registered in that party but you can change your affiliation or you can register affiliation at any time up to now 30 days beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.158" offset="10165394">So, there you have the chance to formidably do something your self to enable you to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.770" offset="10187860">In the Pontikes case, under Illinois law, the only way you can qualify to vote -- the Democratic primary at one point is if you did not vote in the Republican primary 23 months beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.927" offset="10232477">So, the exercise of the franchise will in effect disenfranchise you at any election in the succeeding 23 months or you might wish to vote for or against candidates in the other primary which is your right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.324" offset="10298096">There was one case on a very similar statute which was decided before our case and there were two cases subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.540" offset="10322860">In the prior case, Gordon versus Executive Committee of Charleston which is cited in the brief, there was in a set -- a calendar year requirement.</text>
