            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="11.651" offset="123402">Well this is an income tax case coming to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.014" offset="152764">Section 337 of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, provides that gain or loss to a corporation from a sale or exchange of property taking place during a twelve months period, following the corporation’s adoption of a plan of complete liquidation, is not to be recognized or in other words, is tax free to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.213" offset="253597">What happened here is that a fire largely destroyed the tax payer corporation’s plant in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.287" offset="285884">After the fire the corporation adopted a plan of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.006" offset="304797">There were extensive negotiations with the insurance companies that had provided the fire and business interruption insurance protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.806" offset="340010">These loss claims were settled after the adoption of the plan of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.778" offset="363833">Thus chronologically we have the fire and then the adoption of the plan and during the ensuing year payment of the insurance proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.393" offset="406361">The proceeds exceeded the corporation’s adjusted income tax basis and the destroyed property.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.437" offset="430498">As a consequence there was gain, and the issue is whether that gain is to be allocated to a happening of a fire or to the settlement of the insurance claims during the year of following the adoption of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.399" offset="490371">If the former, the gain is taxable to corporation, if the latter the gain under the statute is not recognized or taxed to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.063" offset="529032">The District Court followed a decision of a few years ago by the Eighth Circuit and entered judgment for the tax payer.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.735" offset="559647">The Court of Appeals refused to follow the Eighth Circuit Opinion and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.633" offset="583262">We affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.261" offset="593816">In an opinion filed today, we have endeavored to trace the history and purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.486" offset="614713">We have set forth our reasons for reaching our conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.944" offset="632477">I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
