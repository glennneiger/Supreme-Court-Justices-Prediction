            <text syncTime="167.043" offset="744908">Yes, that’s certainly true and it’s important that this case be determined here because we do have a division in the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.000" offset="780748">Although six of our circuits agree with the Government’s position is, one case in the Tenth Circuit that is opposite and, of course, the present one is before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.938" offset="836545">The position of the Court of Appeals is that the Government did not show that the mails were used for the purpose of executing the fraudulent scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.587" offset="875102">But that respondent’s transaction was completed after he received the goods and services from each motel and that the subsequent billing was merely incidental and collateral to the scheme and not a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.982" offset="940722">The question here is whether the use of the mails that was charged in the indictment and shown by the evidence practically may be said to have been, for the purpose of executing the fraudulent scheme, in violation of the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.167" offset="1005401">The Government says yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.981" offset="1016686">The respondent says no.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.137" offset="1029329">For a period of two months, ending in April of 1971, the respondent lived with one Meredith in Louisville, Kentucky in Meredith’s apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.971" offset="1072588">He stole from Meredith’s apartment a BankAmericard belonging to Meredith, all of his identification, including his wallet, and he also took from him a 1968 Pontiac Tempus automobile and other personal items.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.281" offset="1141864">Between April 15 and 19 of that same year, he used this credit card to purchase goods and services from merchants in California, Louisiana, and Florida, all the time representing himself as being Meredith.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.372" offset="1214276">For example, as charged in the indictment, on April 17, he charged over $88 at the Sheraton Beach Inn in Bennington Beach, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.577" offset="1259102">And just two days thereafter, he charged over $96 at the Sheraton Inn in San Diego, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.814" offset="1288046">The following week, he made charges of over $62 at the Quality Motel Capri in New Orleans, Louisiana and three days thereafter, at the Holiday Inn in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, he ran up a bill of over $54.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.952" offset="1356591">Subsequent to this, the Citizens National Bank of Louisville, Kentucky which was the issuer of the credit card received by mail copies of the purchase invoices representing these transactions and requesting reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.462" offset="1430570">Such invoices, according to usual business practice, were customarily mailed to the bank and then mailed monthly to the card holder with the bill for his total purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.763" offset="1483755">One hotel owner testified that they are delayed for two or three weeks or even longer before merchants are advised that a particular credit card is being used fraudulently.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.337" offset="1538090">When the respondent left Louisville, Kentucky in Meredith’s Pontiac, he drove to several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.092" offset="1565153">The first one is Indianapolis, Indiana, from there to St. Louis, Missouri and to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.594" offset="1595141">He went to California and to New Orleans and he finally ended up in Knoxville, Tennessee where the car developed transmission trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.362" offset="1630145">At that time, he had his car towed in by the Amco people down there, who took the car to their garage to service it.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.532" offset="1662851">And while he was there, he borrowed from the Amco people another car, a ‘64 Chevrolet.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.031" offset="1696914">He told them that he needed that car to go to a motel to stay for the night and then he would return the next day to get his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.789" offset="1735889">He never returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.232" offset="1741636">He was found two days later in a semi-conscious condition in Kentucky in a hit-and-run accident and as a result of that, he was charged with drunken driving and leaving the scene of an accident, but it’s this Amco car that is the subject of the Dyer Act conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.019" offset="1828780">Now, in addition to the Dyer Act charge, the respondent was indicted on four counts of mail fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.361" offset="1858142">The indictment alleged that he had devised a scheme to defraud the Kentucky Bank, to defraud Meredith, the card holder, and merchants by using the BankAmericard without authorization and falsely securing credit from persons who had agreements with BankAmericard to furnish goods and services on credit to cardholders and, of course, on the condition that payment would be made when due.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.081" offset="1965035">The indictment alleged that the use of the mails was also part of the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.231" offset="1993665">We all realize that in the last decade, one of the most significant commercial developments have come about -- has come about and that is the emergence of the credit card as a substitute for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.698" offset="2059494">Inherent in the three-part type of credit card system, we submit, is the use of the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.114" offset="2089169">The use of the mails is a necessary and essential feature of the collection in the billing systems and in the processing of the sales invoices.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.770" offset="2131801">It is common knowledge and I believe anyone over 21, like respondent who was 31, to charge to collect goods with the credit card knows that, first, the card is a national card.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.295" offset="2173910">He knows too that the invoices must be sent to the card issuing company and in many instances, that’s across state lines, for payment and then to the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.534" offset="2218841">In Pereira, this Court established a broad test for determining whether a defendant, in setting in motion a chain of events which results in the use of the mails by another, has caused a mailing within the meaning of the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.321" offset="2286028">And the Court held in Pereira, “where one doesn’t act with knowledge that the use of the mails will follow in the ordinary course of business or where such use can reasonably be foreseen even though not actually intended, then he causes the mails to be used.”</text>
            <text syncTime="573.231" offset="2369724">But the Sixth Circuit already has conceded the respondent had caused the mailing of the purchase receipts to the Louisville Bank from the motel in the sense that the court said that he should reasonably have foreseen that this use of the mails would necessarily occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.835" offset="2444121">But it, nevertheless, held that these mailings were not a significant factor in the success of the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.067" offset="2481006">We respectfully submit that these mailings were an integral part of the respondent’s scheme because with the delay caused by the mails, it enabled him to go on longer with the scheme and enabled him to avoid detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.806" offset="2560000">At the core of any successful credit card scheme or any credit card involving a single illegal purchase is the necessary delay in detecting the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.770" offset="2611827">The respondent should reasonably have foreseen that the use of the mails would prevented apprehension than being immediate anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.554" offset="2642965">And detection effort --</text>

            <text syncTime="649.628" offset="2675252">If the motel owner had done nothing and not ever even sent the invoice in, I suppose, that would’ve been an even surer way of avoiding detection on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.670" offset="2723422">And I suppose the option wasn’t really there of telephoning or telegraphing the invoice material.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.479" offset="2758635">Well, I would think it would be unreasonable for a merchant not to turn in the invoice, but I would certainly say that if it had not been turned in, then we wouldn’t have a mail fraud violation because you have to have the use of the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.478" offset="2810671">Now whether they could’ve gotten the invoices over there by some other means is really not before us, but I would say if any other means was chosen, then there would not be a violation of the mail fraud statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.361" offset="2862184">Well, it seems to me, the real explanation for delay in this case is not use of the mails, but the distance from the point of origin which the respondent conducted his various activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.124" offset="2933238">It’s hard for me to follow the Government’s argument that implicit in the use of the mails was the idea of delaying the discovery because it seems to me, once he was in Fort Lauderdale and the bank was in Louisville, discovery was going to be delayed absent of telephone communication which was just out of the question?</text>

            <text syncTime="735.253" offset="3017770">But, wouldn’t you agree though that by having to use the mails to even notify the Louisville Bank, they gave him another day?</text>
            <text syncTime="744.245" offset="3053714">By the next day, he’d gone to another state so that even if he just had the delay of one day caused by the mail, it would bring it still within the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.777" offset="3107840">Albeit that there’s probably a lot of argument contra [Attempt to Laughter] on that subject, but if you’re in Fort Lauderdale and mail something to Louisville and send it through the mail, the delay in the people in Louisville finding out what you’ve sent from Fort Lauderdale isn’t necessary the result of the mail.</text>
