            <label>Mr. Michael E. Geltner</label>
            <text syncTime="54.537" offset="218070">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.317" offset="229251">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.666" offset="250567">The plaintiffs’ decedent, Sandra Scheuer, was killed by a national guardsman’s bullet on Kent State University campus in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.661" offset="294557">Thereafter, the plaintiffs brought an action in federal court alleging a deprivation of civil rights under Section 1983, Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1971, specifically detailing the alleged conduct and misconduct of the defendants charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.553" offset="398211">The defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that while the action was in form against the defendants individually, in fact, it affected the State of Ohio, therefore, it was a suit against the State of Ohio and barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.714" offset="462785">Appeal was taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and in a divided opinion, a panel of the circuit affirmed again on the Eleventh Amendment ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.281" offset="521091">Judge White, in writing his majority opinion, went beyond the Eleventh Amendment ground and concluded that he reached the same result under the Doctrine of Executive Immunity which he held covered the field in actions arising under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.257" offset="580963">So, we’re here without a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.439" offset="593711">We’re here with a complaint and motions, and here on a theory which is heretofore had not been applied to actions charging individuals with misconduct under the Civil Rights Act or against any other jurisdictional basis which would otherwise lodge jurisdiction in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.855" offset="695380">As to the first issue, the Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity issue so-called, the novelty to the issue is mentioned in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.325" offset="745221">It has been our position throughout the litigation that this ground was repudiated long ago, it’s inconsistent without basic notion of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.844" offset="791301">The Fourteenth Amendment can be made to co-exist with the Eleventh Amendment only insofar as the Doctrine of Ex parte Young is and remains viable and the Doctrine of Ex parte Young applies a fortiori in a case in which the plaintiffs seeks damages against an individual and charges the individual for misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.195" offset="892761">You make no point of the applicability of the Eleventh Amendment in the case?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_e_geltner" startTime="226.629" stopTime="610.917">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Geltner</label>
            <text syncTime="226.629" offset="906449">I understand Your Honor’s dissenting opinion in the Employees of the Department of Mental Health in the State of Missouri versus the Department of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.598" offset="946364">I certainly am willing to take advantage of that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.788" offset="959112">I don’t think it’s necessary to reach out for that proposition to decide this case on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.291" offset="985130">In point of fact, this Court has never suggested that an action against an individual, an individual who -- or here individuals, who are governmental officers, which doesn’t seek in any way to get at the state treasury or at public property, is an action which falls under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.031" offset="1060049">Therefore, I didn’t feel it was necessary to reach out for what you refer to in your opinion about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.461" offset="1097770">The Missouri case, which is the most recent decision of the Court on point, it seems to me, pins down quite clearly that there has been no sentiment in this Court for the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment could conceivably reach the case such as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.849" offset="1175301">The majority opinion of Justice Douglas makes it quite clear that if the Congress, under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, were to attempt to lodge jurisdiction even against the state, if it were acting validly within a grant of legislative power, could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.963" offset="1263804">Justice Marshall’s opinion for -- himself and Justice Stewart specifically exempts actions against individual officers from the thrust of his opinion which is that the Eleventh Amendment is a jurisdictional limitation, in effect, a gloss on Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.661" offset="1334544">So that, it’s quite clear to me that what the Court of Appeals and what the District Court did was simply express its hostility to the plaintiffs’ view of the case by going out on a grant of decision which is totally unsupported by precedents of this Court, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.719" offset="1410821">So, we get to what I believe is the heart of the case and that is the question of whether or not an executive immunity, so-called or sometimes called a governmental or official immunity, attaches in suits arising under Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, specifically whether or not a governmental official can say “I’m immune from suit” and, therefore, though the plaintiff has charged him specifically with a deprivation of a constitutionally protected right, nevertheless, because of one’s position, one may not be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.008" offset="1559928">The precise issue has not been adjudicated before in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.058" offset="1576229">We have Barr versus Matteo which is a defamation case arising under the District of Columbia in which the Court framed what I view as a federal common law defense to a state tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.156" offset="1644565">Barr versus Matteo, for the reason summarized in our brief, does not really cover the ground here.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.259" offset="1669016">We don’t have a libel action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.078" offset="1680300">I express some doubt as to whether or not the same result would be reached in Barr versus Matteo on the basis of the law of defamation as it now stands after the Court’s opinions leading up to Rosenbloom, but I think it’s pretty clear that Barr versus Matteo does not cover this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.223" offset="1744875">The only expression of judicial opinion in this Court of significance on the immunity question here is Justice Harlan’s concurring opinion in the Bevins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.756" offset="1802971">If you may remember, the Bevins case presented both the question of whether or not there was a cause of action arising under the Fourth Amendment and, likewise, the question of whether or not defendants were immune from suit assuming there was a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.933" offset="1863680">Justice Brennan’s opinion for the majority did not reach that second question because the Court of Appeals had not reached it.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.158" offset="1892624">Justice Harlan noted at the end of his long concurring opinion that it was not appropriate or necessary for him to decide the question, but he believed that it was appropriate to venture the opinion that, for the most flagrant examples of governmental abuse of power, there would certainly be a right to redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.293" offset="1977156">That is essentially the basis of the claim asserted by these -- by the plaintiffs of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.157" offset="2008607">The issue has been spoken to by many Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.991" offset="2039954">By and large, the Courts of Appeals have distinguished actions arising under the Civil Rights Act from state tort actions have noted, as did Justice Harlan, that a deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly more serious than a tort arising under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.942" offset="2127726">For that reason, they concluded that, irrespective of the state rule of immunity which might be applicable, it was clear to those courts that there was no such executive immunity under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.357" offset="2189375">This conclusion, it seems to me, is the appropriate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.128" offset="2200451">It certainly fits the intention of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.734" offset="2218841">The Congress of 1871 perceived the problem before as essentially a problem of violence and saw the problem that was sought to be raised by both Sections 1 and Sections 2 of that Act as governmental and non-governmental violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.753" offset="2294909">The non-governmental violence being essentially covered by Section 2 of the Act which is presently Section 1985, and the governmental violence being covered primarily by Section 1 of the Act, that is, this is an appropriate case fitting within the precise legislative intention of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.093" offset="2392294">The Congress’ intention was recently summarized for the Court in Justice Brennan’s opinion in District of Columbia versus Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.224" offset="2424895">It certainly supports that conclusion that that is what Congress is concerned with.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.653" offset="2546521">There are two relatively long briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.788" offset="2555089">There’s a main brief and a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.934" offset="2563657">We see Moyer versus Peabody, first of all, as being substantially limited by the Court’s opinion in Sterling versus Constantin.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.359" offset="2601378">Secondly, to the extent that Moyer versus Peabody makes an expression that the government of the state can do whatever the governor of the state believes is appropriate to do, it is both overruled by Sterling versus Constantin and, furthermore, fundamentally inconsistent with the thrust of this Court’s decision preceding it as specifically inconsistent with Ex parte Milligan which was decided the year Congress passed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.954" offset="2735752">The sole question that seems, as to the legislative intention, is what that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.444" offset="2753724">It’s inconceivable that that Congress with its view point could have intended an immunity of this kind for a state governor in view of the fact that state law enforcement was primarily what the Congress was attempting to reach with both Section 1 and Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.134" offset="2828434">And so, we get to the prevailing history and it is pretty clear that, unlike the legislative history -- legislative immunity which was recognized in 1871 both by the federal constitution and by parallel state constitutions, and unlike the Law Extending Doctrine of judicial immunity, there is no substantial support for the view of executive immunity at the time that this Congress acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.531" offset="2946090">Congress simply must have seen it as an appropriate purpose to reach governmental misuse of force and there is no basis to believe from the debates that Congress intended to carve out any individuals as immune from the reach of its legislative power.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Geltner</label>
            <text syncTime="773.996" offset="3095928">Well, we distinguish clearly judicial immunity here from executive immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.283" offset="3121110">As I mentioned in my brief, the legislative history to my mind does not even support judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.247" offset="3148904">I reckon that we’ve got Pierson in this Court and Bradley versus Fisher at that time to cope with, this is clearly a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.714" offset="3186834">Now, it is in fact true that many states now have a Doctrine of Executive Immunity for state torts and similar actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.821" offset="3243259">It’s likewise true that this court has recognized such an immunity in Barr versus Matteo with respect to a parallel issue, namely state libel actions, involving federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.756" offset="3314939">They don’t cover this issue and secondly, to the extent that there is an implication in any of these opinions that it is appropriate to distinguish for immunity purposes between ministerial officials and so-called officials exercising discretionary functions, we believe that any such distinction is basically inconsistent with the purpose of the Civil Rights Act and inconsistent with logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.362" offset="3433430">There is, for example, in the remand opinion of the Second Circuit in the Bevins case an suggestion that while the particular parties before the Court, they are Federal Narcotics Bureau Agents, were not immune, possibly the Director of the Federal Narcotics Bureau or somebody else who made basically discretionary decisions would be immune from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.605" offset="3526322">Now, the distinction has never been applied in Civil Rights Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.836" offset="3551295">In tort cases, the distinction has always been a distinction based upon the immunability of lower level officials to mandamus where there is a positive declaration by law that they must do an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.226" offset="3600823">So, for example, a court clerk might be subject to mandamus to compel the court clerk to give a copy of the document to somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.862" offset="3639380">Similarly, those courts have said where refusal to engage in an act, which could be compelled to a mandamus, could be a basis for liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.667" offset="3682638">But those courts have also said a discretionary act, that is one not subject to mandamus, might be immune from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.602" offset="3714403">Now, to hold that as to the Civil Rights Act seems anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.083" offset="3736242">We might, for example, have a situation in which a senior police official orders a policeman to engage in an unconstitutional act and the situation in which the person who commits the act, who had no basic decision making power, is left holding the bag while the officer who made the decision to engage in the constitutional deprivation is, in fact, immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.128" offset="3832477">That seems senseless in view of the fact that it was clearly the purpose of the Congress to reach both.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.683" offset="3866645">In addition, there doesn’t seem any sensible basis to close the doors of the court with respect to that sort of act.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.938" offset="3899664">The distinction between ministerial and discretionary acts, when one clearly looks at it, breaks down.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.897" offset="3923487">In fact, at all levels of government, at least when we’re dealing with the question of use of governmental force, discretion is exercised, so that at both levels, the concept of a ministerial discretionary distinction breaks down as being basically inconsistent with the policies sought to be served, excuse me, by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.731" offset="4022857">So, what we’re left with then is the bare claim that if officials are subject to suit, it will be troublesome for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.580" offset="4066220">They are too important to be called into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.955" offset="4075729">They’ll have to spend time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.401" offset="4081580">They’ll have to spend money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.776" offset="4087014">They might be intimidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.378" offset="4093492">Now, it seems to me that where the Congress has declared a specific policy, the purpose of which is to prevent certain kinds of wrong, it is precisely then that the intimidation should attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.506" offset="4141976">And, in fact, the threat of liability is the way in which the Congress attempted to achieve its result in 1871, preventing the misuse of governmental force on individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.207" offset="4204774">Your Honor, I requested that I reserve 10 minutes, and I believe my 20 minutes is up, so that if there are no further questions now, I’d like to reserve rebuttal time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.915" offset="4439562">The court below, that is the District Court, at the time we filed our motion to dismiss under the Eleventh Amendment and as this Court well knows, the Eleventh Amendment applies not only to suits by the citizens of one state against another state, but the citizens of a state against its own state which is the case here at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.715" offset="4514795">At the time we filed our motion to dismiss, there was pending before the District Judge an affidavit of General del Corso that he was not at the scene, an affidavit from General Canterbury that he gave no order for anyone to fire, and there was the Executive Proclamation of Governor Rhodes that a riotous condition, insurrection, if you will, existed in the city in county -- city of state and the Kent State University Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.834" offset="4651259">Pursuant to that, the National Guard was called out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.347" offset="4665365">Now at this point, under Ohio statutes, the members of the Ohio National Guard had no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.534" offset="4682083">They, of course, had to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.642" offset="4686472">They were ordered to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.190" offset="4700682">It is important to note, and I would like to point out to the Court that, before this Court today, we do not have the issue of the Ohio National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.174" offset="4736627">There are seven named defendants, and those are the only people before the court today and not the entire Ohio National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.506" offset="4781976">Now under the Eleventh Amendment, 12 (b) (1) motion to dismiss which goes to the question of jurisdiction, and of course as this Court well knows the 12 (b) (6) motion goes with the question of whether a cause of action is stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.819" offset="4835265">The Court has consistently held that to determine whether or not a suit is in fact against the state, you look behind the nominal parties defendant named and look at what is the essential nature and effect of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.647" offset="4906527">Now, this test was first set out by the -- was set out by this Court in the Ford case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.735" offset="4930873">Dugan versus Rank, which is a 1963 decision from this Court, defines when a state is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.843" offset="4963370">And if a state is in fact affected, then you look behind the nominal parties defendant and determine that it is a state against the -- a suit against the sub.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.305" offset="5005166">And in Dugan versus Rank this Court stated, if the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain or interfere with the public administration or in the -- if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the government from acting or to compel it to act, then the act is considered as to be one against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.496" offset="5081966">Now, we submit here that the seven named defendants are nominal parties only and that this action is in fact one against the State of Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.623" offset="5422393">There is a definite distinction in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.513" offset="5433992">And, I’m saying here that if the seven named defendants were acting under a constitutional warrant at the time and there is no allegation or challenge to the contrary by the petitioners and if they were acting within the delegation of that statutory warrant, then they are agents of the sovereign and the action may not be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.257" offset="5537019">There is no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.130" offset="5544438">And as I pointed out a moment ago, Your Honor, I would get to the cause of action discussion later as it relates to the Doctrine of Executive Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.380" offset="5597518">But this Court in Barr, in quoting from Gregoire, adopted his -- Judge Hand’s reasoning and logic to the effect that if actions are permitted to be maintained against state officials, then you will have times when a state official will abuse his power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.892" offset="5723533">There will go un-redressed some wrongs, but you must weigh the equities which is more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.433" offset="5749656">This is a pragmatic, a public policy argument, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.073" offset="5768255">And for example, to illustrate that point, as Mr. Chief Justice mentioned a moment ago, in Moyer versus Martin we have the question of calling out the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.743" offset="5806916">Justice Holmes wrote the decision in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.628" offset="5818410">This Court held that the calling out of the National Guard was not reviewable and Justice Holmes stated “as no one would deny that there was immunity for ordering a company fire on a mob in insurrection and that a state law authorizing the governor to deprive citizens of life under such circumstances was consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.586" offset="5894269">We are of the opinion that the same is true of a law authorizing by implication what was done in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.268" offset="5921019">And in that particular case, perhaps a man was unconstitutionally deprived of his liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.088" offset="5944320">He was put in jail for, I think, two-and-a half months, but this Court held that the discretion of the Executive Branch of a state government in calling out the National Guard is his discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.284" offset="6357055">Sterling versus Constantin did not in fact overruled Moyer, It cited it with approval and stated they were dealing with a different situation there, taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.902" offset="6399582">Moving on now to the effect test, that is if the nature of the lawsuit even though naming nominal parties as defendant in fact affects state government, then it is an action against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.958" offset="6463739">And this Court in Dugan versus Rank, which is a 1963 decision, stated the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.449" offset="6489757">The general rule is that if suit is against the sovereign, if the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury, domain, or interfere with the administration of justice, if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain government from acting or to compel it to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.667" offset="6550570">Now, that is exactly what we’re talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.652" offset="6562586">Granted, the Dugan case is a federal government case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.913" offset="6579618">But which is more important, the constitutionally granted rights to the states, that is, the Eleventh Amendment, or the common law interpretation of the immunity of a federal government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.229" offset="6628833">Along that same line, as this Court well knows in Barr versus Matteo, they quoted, with approval, Judge Learned Hand in Gregoire versus Biddle and I’d like to quote a part of Judge Hand’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.336" offset="6705319">“Again and again, the public interest calls for action which may turn out to be found on a mistake, in the face of which, an official may later find himself hard put to satisfy a jury of his good faith, the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.526" offset="6786090">In this instance, it has been thought in the end better to leave un-redressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.684" offset="6850664">I submit to the Court that that is exactly a situation with which we are here confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.171" offset="6880653">What would be the effect on state officials in every state of the Union if Federal Court would be granted jurisdiction in this kind of a situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.341" offset="6937287">Any vituperative, vindictive, plaintiff wanting to vent his spleen on a state official could file a lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.391" offset="7225469">This is a very pragmatic policy consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1862.109" offset="7448346">And further, that the only material before the court when considering a motion were affidavits which I’ve previously mentioned, which incidentally were in the Krause case and not the Missouri case but they’re, in effect, companion cases and the court also took judicial notice of the facts as they existed at Kent State on this tragic day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.714" offset="7534759">And I’m sure this Court is well aware of Judge O’Connor’s concurring opinion in that regard in the Sixth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.501" offset="7633920">And yet, this Court has held in Pierson versus Ray, a 1969 decision, that judges acting within their scope as judges are immune under 1983 for acts within their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.058" offset="7720229">In the Tenney case, which is a 1950 case, this very Court held legislators immune while doing things within their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.651" offset="7774563">Now, it seems to me in Congress, that the people that passed the laws and the people that interpret the laws have immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.724" offset="7826808">When the very person designated by the Constitution of the United States and the constitutions of the respective states would not have immunity to carryout the very laws that the legislature imposes and the judiciary interprets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.815" offset="7883233">I would respectfully submit that petitioners are in error when they state that executive immunity was unknown prior to 1871 enactment of 1983, and we cite in our brief two cases, both preceding 1983: General versus Stokes and Wilks versus Demson, an 1845 case and an 1849 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.544" offset="7982080">So, executive immunity did, in fact, exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.748" offset="7998903">And another point I think worthy of comment; our laws as traditionally were adopted in this country were a carryover, of course, from the common law of England which has known immunity for some period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.854" offset="8075389">Barr versus Matteo which it, once again, quotes Gregoire versus Biddle and as I’ve previously stated, Moyer versus Peabody, Holmes -- the Court there held that, certainly, the discretionary act of the governor in calling out the guard was within his power and right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.458" offset="11649776">Yes, Moyer was and, Your Honor, if I could mention, the thing about Moyer is, Moyer was a case in which the Governor of Colorado concluded that there was an insurrection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.925" offset="11699618">As a consequence of his conclusion that there was an insurrection, he imprisoned the plaintiff and the plaintiff later brought an action charging a deprivation of the constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.446" offset="11741727">Now, the thing about Moyer is Moyer holds that the governor’s decision of insurrection is unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.088" offset="11772343">That part of Moyer is clearly overruled by Sterling versus Constantin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.439" offset="11797734">The dictum in Justice Holmes’ opinion in Moyer to the effect that the governor could do more than imprison, it seems to me, is completely out of consonance with our traditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.253" offset="11856980">The concept is basically that in an insurrection, which we did not have here, in an insurrection the governor could do whatever he pleases to put down the insurrection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.305" offset="11893133">In fact, in Ex parte Milligan, the Court held that there was only one thing that an insurrection or rebellion change, and that was he permitted the writ of habeas corpus to be suspended during the continuation of the insurrection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.281" offset="12437107">Specific intention to cause injury or deprive one of the constitutional right is a prerequisite to establishing criminal liability under Section 18 US Code, Section 241 which is the criminal analogue of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.785" offset="12511086">In Monroe, the Court specifically dealt with the distinction on how that specific intention is not necessary, rather, Section 1983 was to be interpreted in line with the intention of Congress to reach governmental misuse of force and with the preexisting body of tort law which founded liability on fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.395" offset="12601574">So that, the only question that relates to the viability of the cause of action is whether or not we have alleged and proved fault on the part of the individual defendants which fault lead to the deprivation of a constitutional right, in this case, the right not to kill.</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.814" offset="13791190">The latest opinion which is cited in our reply brief, which explores the area most carefully, is Chief Judge Friendly’s opinion in Johnson versus Glick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.397" offset="13833509">We rely on that case and the cases it cites.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.888" offset="13871543">It has been my feeling all along, as expressed by the opinion of the courts below, that somehow they read the newspapers and took judicial notice of the conclusion that everything the guard did was proper and that there was an insurrection or something close to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.915" offset="13923579">The fact of the matter is there are no affidavits in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.654" offset="14070596">It is the Stratton Commission Report which is not in the record, it is the only doctrine of which, under the rules of evidence, the Court at this point should take judicial notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.220" offset="14172787">Now, there -- we’ve been hearing throughout the case the view that this immunity is necessary because, in the absence of immunity, the court’s opinion flooded with complaints These complaints are all going to be frivolous and as a result of only these frivolous complaints, the government is going to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.332" offset="14249273">People are just going to stop acting.</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.234" offset="14568908">And further, it requires this Court to make basically a legislative finding of fact and I think the Congress has made that finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.771" offset="14603076">Congress considered these issues when Congress acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.412" offset="14613629">And at this point, the Court, in order to reverse the congressional decision, would in effect be making a legislative act in a face of another legislative act without any empirical basis to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.486" offset="14669845">So, I think that all of those theories are just untenable as a basis for either the Eleventh Amendment ground or the executive immunity ground.</text>
