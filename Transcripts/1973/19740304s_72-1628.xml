            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="15.865" offset="140225">These cross petitions from the same judgment are here by a way of writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.088" offset="181081">The plaintiffs in this litigation are creators and producers of televised programs, copyrighted under the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1909 as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.394" offset="230296">They commenced this litigation in 1964 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming that the defendants had infringed their copyrights by intercepting broadcast transmissions of copyrighted material and rechanneling these programs through various community antenna television systems to the paying subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.639" offset="327262">Systems such as these are commonly known as CATV systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.089" offset="353071">The suit was initially stayed by agreement of the parties pending this Court’s decision in the case called Fortnightly Corporation against the United Artists Television Corporation, reported in volume 392 of the United States Reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.144" offset="417332">In that case, decided in 1968, we held that the reception and distribution of television broadcasts by the CATV systems, there involved, did not constitute a performance within the meaning of the Copyright Act and, thus, did not amount to copyright infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.887" offset="496327">After that decision the plaintiffs in the present litigation filed supplemental pleadings in which they sought to distinguish the five CATV systems, challenged here, from those whose operations had been found not to constitute copyright infringement in the Fortnightly case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.776" offset="571873">The District Court subsequently dismissed the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs’ cause of action was barred by the Fortnightly decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.078" offset="609071">On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.440" offset="654524">Both the plaintiffs and the defendants petitioned for certiorari, and because of the seemingly important questions of federal law involved, we granted both petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.249" offset="701753">For the reasons set out in detail in a written opinion filed today, we have concluded that the District Court was correct in holding that the plaintiff’s complaint was barred by this Court’s Fortnightly decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.840" offset="752118">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part and these cases are remanded to the District Court with directions to reinstate its original judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.842" offset="800078">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice has joined and Mr. Justice Blackmun has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
