            <text syncTime="4.366" offset="94250">First of these is 72-1125 from -- on appeal from a Three-Judge District Court in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.483" offset="134687">The appellees or the union and members of the union, and the appellants are police and sheriff of a county in Texas, and the controversy arose in connection with the effort of the union to unionize farm workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.002" offset="248790">The opinion is long; the facts are involved; the decision that we filed today for majority of the Court in the case that there are parts of the action of the District Court that were within the permissible limits of the prior decisions of this Court and in the federal statute that enjoining some of the police actions were justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.357" offset="422139">However, in the broad reach of the case there were five Texas statutes involved which the District Court declared unconstitutional, but it appears that three of those statutes have been repealed and replaced by more narrowly grown provisions since the time of this decision by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.569" offset="534988">Accordingly we are not sure what the opinion status maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.306" offset="545959">So we remand -- we reverse in part and -- affirmed in part and remand in part to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.503" offset="590785">This is a decision in which Mr. Justice Powell took no part and in which the Chief Justice has filed an opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part, and he is joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
