            <label>Mr. Arthur B. Hanson</label>
            <text syncTime="66.163" offset="341368">And Your Honors, we would like to call your attention to two items.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.128" offset="357251">One appearing at page 20 and another, 21 of the Solicitor General’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.823" offset="384000">The footnote on page 20 refers to the time, that the Government filed its petition for writ of certiorari in Schmid against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.465" offset="430602">And it discusses the fact that this might increase the Government’s potential liability by more than $12 million if that case were not reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.421" offset="462472">I had the pleasure of arguing Schmid in the Court of Claims and I protested vehemently at that time that this remark was placed in the Schmid petition to this court that it was outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.555" offset="510955">This was never raised in the court below, and the Court of Claims, it’s never been raised in the Ninth Circuit nor in the District Courts that have considered this matter and I think it is inappropriate as it be brought before the court, I would ask that it be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.566" offset="566962">Truthfully, they can find out what it would cost but they never have and they never tried to put it into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.591" offset="587128">I don’t think it should be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.172" offset="597473">Secondly, on page 21, I would almost say the Freudian slip but I will term it inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.142" offset="625267">In the middle of the page, when they quote under paragraph number two, they say, “for the purpose of this subsection” when they are trying to discuss our approach to interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.200" offset="669571">I would urge the court to note that this was done in Schmid and it was done in the Ninth Circuit and here it is again.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.850" offset="696111">We have repeatedly called the government’s attention that the statute reads “for the purposes of this subsection” and that is highly important and we’re sorry that it slipped back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.315" offset="738011">Now, if I may I’ll address my remarks to the case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.472" offset="758596">We are here primarily on a matter involving purely a question of statutory construction, the statute involved is 10 U.S.C. 687 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="183.405" offset="810318">An impertinent part, that statute involves reserve officers of all the services who have served more than their -- one might say indentured service in a sense whether they were in the draft call or whether they were called up for some other purpose, they have served more than four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.015" offset="884820">And then have extended onward their service at the request of the Government and then were discharged involuntarily before they reached a fifth year of service when the war in Vietnam was winding down and they were released just prior to the fifth year, in many instances within a few days of having completed five years of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.635" offset="979278">Now, we have cited this statute for purposes of this discussion before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.012" offset="1004774">If you see page two of our brief, we have set it forth and I think that since we’re dealing with the exact language, I would like to recite it to you in a sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.954" offset="1056601">We say, “Non-Regulars: readjustment payment upon involuntary release from active duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.117" offset="1081260">“Except for members covered by subsection (b), a member of the reserve -- of a reserve component or a member of the Army or the Air Force without component who is released from active duty involuntarily, or because he was not accepted for an additional tour of active duty for which he volunteered after he’d completed a tour of active duty, and who has completed immediately before his release, at least five years of continuous active duty, is entitled to a readjustment payment computed by multiplying his years of active service other than in time of war or of national emergency declared by Congress after June 28, 1962, but not more than eighteen, by two months' basic pay of the grade in which he is serving at the time of his release.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.282" offset="1261923">For the purposes of this subsection, (1) a period of active duty is continuous, if it is not interrupted by a break in service of more than 30 days; and (2) a part of a year that is six months or more is counted as a whole year, and a part of a year that is less than six months is disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.876" offset="1352202">Now with that statute in front of you, with nothing else before you, I think the court would reach the same conclusion that the Court of Claims did.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.301" offset="1385953">And we urge that the court read carefully the decision Schmid.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.752" offset="1407791">As you may recall Your Honors, you rejected the petitioners’ certiorari in Schmid by applying the two votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.405" offset="1434331">Now, what has happened is that a number of officers in Schmid’s case, he had a requirement for some $13,000.00 or $14,000.00, so he had to go to the Court of Claims on the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.009" offset="1488771">Certain of the other people involved have gone to the Federal District Court as a matter of convenience because they had $10,000.00 or less dollars involved that jurisdictionally, they could use the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.954" offset="1528581">And that’s why we are here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.359" offset="1534224">Cass was one of those who had $10,000.00, some odd dollars and he waved the above $10,000.00 to come here in the District Court.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="384.710" stopTime="386.195">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="384.710" offset="1615621">All these people are officers, I know.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur B. Hanson</label>
            <text syncTime="386.195" offset="1621577">Your Honor, these are all officers but it would be my view that it’s applicable to all members of the reserve who are in there on a voluntary extension of their four-year enlistment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.373" offset="1678211">And what happened in this case was that many of these people officers and men served more than the five years during the Vietnam unpleasantness which was not declared a state of emergency or a war and that’s why the terms of the statute but those have already been taken care of by recomputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.588" offset="1759086">It happens that this applies only to those who had extended their service expecting to go on for as long as the government needed them and then when the government saw that situation lining down, they quickly got a number of them out before they completed the fifth year.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.652" offset="1823347">It might interest you to know that Schmid in that case had served four years plus in a previous enlistment as an enlisted man and then came back in the Navy as an officer and served four years, six months and some odd days.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.238" offset="1881652">So that when actually we went in for his case, we were dealing with a recomputation based on his total years of service which gave him something in excess of $13,000.00 as opposed to the smaller amounts here although he is of a similar rank.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur B. Hanson</label>
            <text syncTime="474.981" offset="1976633">No, because the statute very clearly states that a period of active duty is continuous if it is not interrupted by a break in service of more than 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.128" offset="2017280">But I’m glad you raised that because that again emphasizes the defining portions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.337" offset="2046119">The statute’s main body is defined in two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.380" offset="2062315">“For the purposes of this subsection; (1) a period of active duty is continuous, if it is not interrupted by a break in service of more than 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.166" offset="2097424">If it had been interrupted by a break in service of more than 30 days such as the five months you raised, then he would not qualify for this statute.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="513.283" offset="2129920">Why couldn’t you argue under your theory that the part of the year, that’s six months or more should be counted as a full year?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_b_hanson" startTime="521.148" stopTime="600.997">
            <label>Mr. Arthur B. Hanson</label>
            <text syncTime="521.148" offset="2161371">Because another section of the statute covers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.538" offset="2170880">The other section says, “A part of a year that’s six months or more is counted as a whole year, and a part of a year that is less than six months is disregarded for -- this is for purposes of eligibility in that sense whereas if he doesn’t have unbroken active duty, if it's only broken for 30 days, he still qualifies under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.975" offset="2248620">But if he has a break of more than 30 days, he is disqualified and he is eliminated from it under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.063" offset="2281012">And what I’m suggesting to Your Honor is that you will find that you must read the statute as a whole and it is not at all unusual to qualify a statute by the language in the following part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.622" offset="2335242">Now, I will call your attention to 6330, Title 10, U.S.C 6330, which is quoted on page 11 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.019" offset="2372859">And that again is interesting because it is applicable to exactly the same sort of recomputation and eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.984" offset="2408699">That applies to members of the Marine Corp and Marine Corp Reserve, they're going to be transferred to the Fleet Marine Corp Reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.591" offset="2439105">It says, “For the purposes of subsections (b) and (c), a part of a year that is six months or more is counted as a whole year and a part of a year that’s less than six months is disregarded.”</text>

            <text syncTime="782.961" offset="3208568">I’d call two things to the Court’s attention, first, 6330 was passed in 1958.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.623" offset="3263216">When they recodified these matters in 1962, some water had gone under the bridge and we believe that the Congress intended to do exactly what it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.820" offset="3324029">And the fact that the Senate said, “Well we don’t think this is any substantive change,” is really immaterial to the consideration of this matter because when it was passed by both Houses, a change did appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.805" offset="3371990">And the change is the one that finds 687 (a) exactly as the Court of Claims found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.276" offset="3393829">And I would urge this court to pay particular attention to the language in the Court of Claims decision where they went behind the statute and stated very clearly on page three of their opinion that although we find the sections clear and unambiguous on its face and its susceptible on its face of only one interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.798" offset="4195892">Might I point out in the beginning that our case is slightly different than that of Cass because we deal with three Marine Captain Aviators and the statute, we cite 6330 of Title 10, deals specifically with the Navy and the Marine Corps and specifically with Regulars and Reserves of the Navy in Marine Corps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.665" offset="4343432">As with Cass, we take the position of course that the statute is clear on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.709" offset="4371540">First, it sets forth a standard and the standard is, “At least five years of continuous active duty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.418" offset="4406439">And then with the preface, “For the purposes, I emphasize, of this subsection,” it goes on to define specifically what the phrase continuous active duty means as was explained to Mr. Justice Rehnquist and then it specifically defines the word year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.410" offset="4518348">Now, what the Ninth Circuit did, I submit is it overlooked the plain meaning of the words in Section 2 defining the word year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.133" offset="4569234">And it took the first part of the statute, subsection (1) and then ignored (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.107" offset="4625136">The statute, 10 U.S.C. 6330 uses exactly the same phraseology, the same words as does 687 (a) and specifically as I pointed out refers to Navy and Marine personnel both regular and reserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.658" offset="4835370">And since we are dealing all our clients in this case are reservists, I think it’s significant and I was just about if I may call the court’s attention to a statute that no one has cited in the briefs, the Justice or the amicus curiae or anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.199" offset="4893571">And it is 10 U.S.C. 277.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.375" offset="4910289">And its states that the laws applying to both regulars and reserves shall be administered without discrimination, (1) among regulars; (2) among reserves; and (3) between regulars and reserves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.691" offset="5687484">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.097" offset="5701172">The government’s view is that this case presents an instance where a mistake was made in the codification of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.605" offset="5743177">Petitioners contend that the Act is clear on its face and that because it is clear, this court cannot look to either the antecedent statute or the legislative history of the 1962 codification in construing the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.224" offset="5801691">And alternatively, they argue that the legislative history supports their claim that in 1962, Congress intended to change the eligibility requirement. Our position is that the statute is not clear and that any doubt as to its meaning is dispelled by a consideration of the antecedent statute and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.947" offset="5892493">And even if the statute redeemed clear on the first examination, there surely is no rule which forbids resort to aids and construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.206" offset="5933558">And indeed, resort to such aids is particularly -- excuse me, particularly appropriate in the case of codified statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.637" offset="5967308">Now, when we begin with subsection (a) of the Adjustment Act, we find that it deals with two subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.698" offset="5995520">First, Congress expressly fixed the eligibility requirement at five years of continuous act of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.972" offset="6028643">It then provided that the amount of pay would be computed by multiplying years of service by two months basic pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.605" offset="6067200">Because calculation of amount of pay rests on years of service, it was then necessary to account for fractional service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.651" offset="6103353">And we submit that the “rounding” provision, that part of a year which is six months or more shall be counted as a year and less than six months disregarded applies to calculation and only to calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.008" offset="6156748">We have a hypothetical in our brief, which illustrates our position clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.129" offset="6177228">If a serviceman had served four years and eight months, he would not in our view be eligible for adjustment pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.948" offset="6208575">If however, he had served 13 years and four months, he would be eligible and the amount of the pay would be computed by multiplying 13 by two months of basic pay, the four months being disregarded under the “rounding” provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.422" offset="6270433">If he had served 13 years and eight months, it would be calculated by multiplying two months basic pay by 14 years, the eighth months being counted as a year under the “rounding” provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.378" offset="6322260">It would be possible to read the “rounding” provision to apply to its eligibility by focusing on the plural purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.153" offset="6361339">But to do so involves a number of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.090" offset="6381087">One as Mr. Justice White has pointed out that part of the “rounding” provision, which calls for disregarding less than six months, has no application.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.724" offset="6835618">And the question is whether the court can resort to aids and construction in determining what Congress intended with this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.415" offset="6874384">Now, an additional factor is that in the Adjustment Pay Act, Congress specifically required five years of continuous service for eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.805" offset="6915971">A “rounding” provision would not be necessary for eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.574" offset="6931017">I agree it would not be necessary in 6330 either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.863" offset="6948153">And since a “rounding” provision really serves only one function as a matter of necessity, we submit that the words immediately preceding it in the Adjustment Pay Act for the purposes of this section are ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.108" offset="7005205">And any doubt as to what Congress intended is dispelled by a consideration of the original Act and the legislative history of the 1962 codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.861" offset="7056196">The adjustment pay was established in 1956 and at that time there was no ambiguity in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.170" offset="7093394">That Act required five years continuous service and then with respect to the “rounding” provision, it expressly stated that the “rounding” provision was to be applied in computing the amounts of adjustment pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.884" offset="7148251">The eligibility requirement and the restriction of the “rounding” provision to computation remained unchanged until 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.956" offset="7184614">In 1962, Congress recodified recent military pay legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.168" offset="7209378">And in the course of codification, the words preceding the “rounding” provision were changed from, “For the purposes of computing the amount of adjustment pay” to “for the purposes of this subsection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.366" offset="7266220">That this change was inadvertent, is demonstrated by consideration of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.387" offset="7294328">The Senate Report states that no substantive change was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.823" offset="7316062">While the Senate and House Reports purport to list all changes made in the codified legislation, the change in the “rounding” provision is not referred to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.042" offset="9652872">And finally, page 11 of our brief, we’ve listed a number of statutes which include the “rounding” provision and we submit that our construction is consistent with the pattern of similar legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.160" offset="9805427">We submit that the best refutation for the last argument that all the services administratively construe this the same way is specious because it’s the Department of Defense order and it's axiomatic that if the Department of Defense construes the statute one way, the all four branches will routinely take the order of the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.224" offset="9925695">And secondly, we submit that the government has construed the statute or should construe this statute in the same way it is construing 6330 as it has done routinely in 6330 for the last 16 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.889" offset="10168320">So it’s quite a different situation from the language of 1330 which has remained unchanged from its enactment, hasn’t it?</text>
