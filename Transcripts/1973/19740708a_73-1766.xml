            <text syncTime="44.500" offset="283526">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.825" offset="300871">On March 1 last, United States District Court grand jury, set it here, returned an indictment against seven defendants charging various offenses including among them a conspiracy to defraud the United States and also to obstruct justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.062" offset="397733">John Mitchell, one of the defendants, was a former Attorney General of the United States and also Chairman of the Committee to Reelect the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.059" offset="441724">Another, H.R. Haldeman, was the President’s Chief of Staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.810" offset="460741">Another, John Ehrlichman, was Assistant to the President for Economic -- for Domestic Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.799" offset="488744">The others were either on the President’s staff or held responsible positions on the Reelection Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.678" offset="528241">In the course of its deliberations, the grand jury voted unanimously with 19 members concurring that the course of events in the formation and continuation of the conspiracy was such that President Nixon, among a number of others, should be identified as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Bill, particular as to be filed in connection with the pretrial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.653" offset="664182">Now, although this particular decision and determination on the part of the grand jury occurred in February, it was a well-kept secret for two-and-a half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.633" offset="724055">The grand jury, of course, knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.183" offset="730220">The members of the prosecution staff knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.938" offset="745267">It was done so to avoid affecting the proceedings in a House Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.134" offset="774106">It was so kept during these two-and-a half months until it became necessary to reveal it as a result of the President’s motion to quash a subpoena, as I will indicate subsequently in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.473" offset="839412">Now, to obtain addition evidence which the Special Prosecutor has good reason to believe is in the possession of and under the control of the President and which it is believed by the Special Prosecutor as quite important to the development of the government’s proof at the trial in United States versus Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.561" offset="943797">A Special Prosecutor, on behalf of the United States, moved for a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.776" offset="972636">And, it is the subpoena here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.213" offset="990400">The District Court ordered the subpoena to issue returnable on May 2 and the subpoena, of course, called for the production of tape recordings in advance of September 9, 1972 which is a trial date.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.051" offset="1057691">And, this was done to allow time for litigation in the event litigation was to ensue over the production of the tapes and also for transcription and authentication of any tape recordings that were produced in response to the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.794" offset="1128744">On April 30, the President released to the public and submitted to the House Judiciary Committee 1,216 pages of edited transcripts of 43 conversations dealing with Watergate.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.667" offset="1196244">Portions of 20 of the subpoenaed conversations were included among the 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.135" offset="1234070">Then, on May 1, the President advised counsel to file a special appearance, a formal claim of privilege, and a motion to quash a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.275" offset="1282658">Now for the United States to conduct a full and appropriate hearing on a motion to quash the subpoena, it became necessary to reveal the grand jury’s finding regarding the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.849" offset="1356950">And, this was first done by the Special Prosecutor calling on the Chief of Staff, General Alexander Haig, and the President’s counsel, Mr. St. Claire, and advising them of what had occurred two-and-a half months prior.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.807" offset="1416718">And then, on the following morning, advising Judge Rico of what had occurred in camera and pointing out at the necessity of this being used in connection with the arguments on a motion to quash because of their relevance and the necessity of these matters being made a part of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.936" offset="1513267">Now, the Special Prosecutor joined counsel for the President in urging that matter be heard in camera, which, was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.237" offset="1558511">Three of the defendants had joined the Special Prosecutor in moving for the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.540" offset="1591738">All of the defendants, at the time of argument in camera to Judge Sirica, opposed the motion to quash.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.572" offset="3095764">Now invest in almost 500 pages of briefs, when boiled down, this case really presents one fundamental issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.199" offset="3154279">Basically, this is not a novel question, although the factual situation involved is, of course, unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.601" offset="3187924">There are primary questions to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.140" offset="3202135">But in the end, after the rounds have been made, we return to face these flaring facts that I want to briefly review for the final answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.098" offset="3245916">In refusing to produce the evidence sought by a subpoena duces tecum in the criminal trial of seven defendants, among them, Former Chief of aids and Dubieties, the President invokes the provisions of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.143" offset="3314148">His counsel’s brief is replete with references for the constitution as justifying his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.356" offset="3355004">And in his public statement, as we all know, the President has embraced the constitution that’s offering him support for his refusal to supply the subpoenaed tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.334" offset="3414876">Now, the President may be right in how he reads the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.368" offset="3439013">But, he may also be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.690" offset="3452284">And if he is wrong, who is there to tell him so?</text>
            <text syncTime="842.821" offset="3476839">And if there’s no one, then the President, of course, is free to pursue his course of erroneous interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.668" offset="3524173">What then becomes of our constitutional form of government?</text>
            <text syncTime="860.322" offset="3546847">So when counsel for the President, in his brief, states that this case goes to the heart of our basic constitutional system, we agree because, in our view, this nation’s constitutional form of government is in serious jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.854" offset="6228996">Before discussing the case as, however, I think that it would be appropriate for us to undertake the bases in the right perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.549" offset="6263686">Let me say, first, that we stand upon two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.129" offset="6278001">First, that, actually, the orders that were entered creating the Office of the Special Prosecutor and delineating his authority, even the original order at the time that my predecessor was acting as Special Prosecutor had the force and effect of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.816" offset="6348741">We also point to the fact that the arrangement made itself with the Acting Attorney General that I made, if I may point to it, and one reason I have no resonance in discussing the facts is because the facts are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.172" offset="6406210">There has been no dispute raised as to just what actually transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.769" offset="6424600">The situation is one of the arrangements itself which the Acting Attorney General points to, with respect to the matter of independence having been discussed by him with the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.892" offset="6501087">Thus, meaning that the President, himself, had approved the setting up of this particular office and the rights and the responsibilities that it has under the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.197" offset="6558347">Now, let me -- we set this out in the Appendix, of course, pointing precisely to what the authority and responsibilities and obligations of the Special Prosecutor are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.506" offset="6607562">One of the expressed duties that’s delegated to the Special Prosecutor is that he shall have full authority for investigating and prosecuting, among others, allegations involving the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.086" offset="6661897">And a delegation of authority expressly states in particular the Special Prosecutor shall have full authority to determine whether or not to contest the assertion of executive privilege or any other testimonial privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.373" offset="6739010">Now in the instance of my appointment, unlike the appointment that had been made prior thereto, there was an amended order and it referred to assurances given by the President to the Attorney General that the President will not exercise his constitutional powers to affect the stories of the Special Prosecutor or to limit the independence that he’s hereby given, and that he will not be removed from his duties except for extraordinary improprieties on his part and without the President’s first consulting the majority and the minority leaders and the chairman in ranking the minority members of the Judiciary Committees and the Senate and House Representatives, and ascertaining that their consensus is in accord with the proposed action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.321" offset="6934824">And then, that the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor will not be limited without the President’s first consulting with such members of Congress and ascertaining that their consensus is in accord with his proposed action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.025" offset="8361632">Then, he further said, I understand and it is clear to me, that “Mr. Jaworski can go to court and test out,” and these are the important words, “and test out any refusal to produce documents on the grounds of confidentiality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.291" offset="8418684">And Attorney General Saxbe, then a designate who was also present at the time that this matter was discussed and at the time that I accepted the responsibilities, testified that I had the right to contest an assertion of executive privilege and stated that I can go to court at any time to determine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.680" offset="8516277">Now the President himself, as we point out in our brief, in announcing the appointment of a new independent prosecutor, stated to the nation that he had no greater interest than to see that the new Special Prosecutor has the cooperation from the Executive Branch and the independence that he needs to bring about that conclusion of the Watergate investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.460" offset="8627350">The President’s Chief of Staff, at the time that this appointment was accepted and at the time that the new regulations were then drafted by the Acting Attorney General, had assured me, and this is a part of the record, because a letter was written at the request of Senator Hugh Scott to the White House as a result of discussions that he had with General Haig in which I sent a copy of the testimony that I had given to the Congressional Committees, to the White House so it would fully be aware of it and the receipt of it was acknowledged without any change in the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.415" offset="8783144">So, I had been assured of the right to judicial process and by him after he had reviewed the matter with the President and he came and told me that I would have the right to take the President to court, and that these were the key words in this arrangement, and that the right would not be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.589" offset="8859840">Of course, this independence was given to the Special Prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.759" offset="8876558">Actually, it was but an echo of public demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.225" offset="8894426">And, if I may be permitted to say so, it was the only basis on which, after what had occurred and a predecessor had been discharged, it was on a basis on which that Special Prosecutor could have felt that he could come and serve and undertake to perform these functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.040" offset="8981675">It’s important, I think, to observe that the counsel for the President in his brief, by accepting the proposition that the President and the Attorney General can delegate certain executive functions to subordinate officers, implicitly has conceded, so we think, the validity of the regulations delegating prosecutorial powers to the Special Prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.052" offset="9081776">The regulations specifically provide, as you will notice from the Appendix and we have set them out, that the Attorney General will not counterman or interfere with the Special Prosecutor’s decisions or actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.599" offset="9131931">This is also a part of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.143" offset="9150112">Just to argue as has been done in these briefs, that the separation of powers precludes the courts from entertaining this action because it is the exclusive prerogative of the Executive Branch, not the Judiciary, to determine whom to prosecute, on what charges, and with what evidence, we think, misses the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.112" offset="9245929">What has evolved from the regulations, in our view, is a prosecutorial force with certain exclusive responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.091" offset="9281874">And this is why I say that to some degree it could be described as a quasi-independent agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.502" offset="9311549">It’s not unlike our situation as the case we alluded to a few minutes ago, decided by the court just a week or so ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.768" offset="9348643">It’s not unlike the case of the Secretary of Agriculture versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.102" offset="9369959">This is the first time that there has been an action brought by one member of the Executive Branch against another official in the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.140" offset="9406112">And, we refer to these cases in our briefs in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.175" offset="9430249">Now, I want to make it clear that the President, at no point of course, delegated to the Special Prosecutor the exclusive right to pass on the question of executive privilege or any other privilege, attorney-inclined privilege, or any other testimonial privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.472" offset="9515409">What we are merely saying is that we have the clear right to test it in this court, and this is on what we stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.652" offset="9556160">Well because of the passage of time, if I may, I think I should get to other discussions unless there are questions on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.124" offset="9602031">Passing to the merits, we would say that if there is any one principle of law that Marbury versus Madison cites, it is that it is up to the court to say what the law is and almost to the point of redundancy but necessary because it was a landmark decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.549" offset="9671725">Chief Justice Marshall reasoned, we think, with clarity and emphasis that it is emphatically the province and the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.303" offset="9710700">And this court of course, through the years, has reaffirmed consistently applied that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.143" offset="9742151">It’s done it in a number of cases, in Powell versus McCormack, in the Youngstown steel seizure case, and Doe versus McMillan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.736" offset="9792516">And a footnote, I think a very important one, appears in that opinion when Mr. Justice White pointed out that while an inquiry such as involved in a present case, because it involves two coordinate branches of government, must necessarily have separation of power implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.433" offset="9891258">The Separation of Powers Doctrine has not previously prevented this court from reviewing the acts of Congress even when, it is pointed out, the Executive Branch is also involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.389" offset="9951131">Now, there are a number of cases that speak to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.864" offset="9968999">I think one of the cases that went into greater detail and also points out quite a distinguishing feature is the Gravel case where as, in the Gravel case, the court did hold that it was appropriate to go into certain matters where a privilege had been exercised on a part of a senator on behalf of his aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.534" offset="10075683">There are two things that I believe clearly help us in that decision and also other decisions as far as the questions here are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.251" offset="10118524">One is that the Speech or Debate Clause is in the constitution, as is the Journal Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.344" offset="10150916">It’s in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.483" offset="10159484">It’s written in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.703" offset="10168365">And, this is what was invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.778" offset="10176620">I don’t find anything written in the constitution and nothing has been pointed that is a writing in the constitution that relates to the right of the exercise of executive privilege on the part of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.248" offset="10234507">Another very important thing that’s pointed out in that case is that it did involve an examination into wrongdoing on that part of those who were seeking to invoke the privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.615" offset="11699977">And, if I may just say very briefly, that summarizes the situation by saying that the heart of Marshall’s opinion was, therefore, just as summarized by the Court of Appeals in the Nixon v. Sirica case and the tapes case that we have talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.694" offset="11776254">The court was to show respect for the President’s reason, but the ultimate decision remained with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.382" offset="11803108">And we are not suggesting, for a moment, here that the matter of executive privilege should not be looked into.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.256" offset="11850547">But, the ultimate decision is not one of saying that it is absolute that it rests on the constitution that it doesn’t entitle anyone and doesn’t authorize anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.214" offset="11886387">It doesn’t even authorize this court to look into it, because if the courts are the ultimate interpreters of the constitution and can restrain Congress to operate within the constitutional balance, they certainly shouldn’t be empowered and lest to measure Presidential claims of constitutional powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.834" offset="11972904">I wanted briefly to make mention of the questions that has been raised by counsel for the President that involves a motion to expunge the finding of the grand jury’s action that the President is to be named as an unindicted co-conspirator along with a number of others when the pretrial proceedings are going into, and a Bill of Particulars is being filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.445" offset="12115324">And I say that the grand jury’s finding, painful as it is I think, on the part of the court, must be considered as being valid and sufficient to show a prima facie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.039" offset="12169658">It is sufficient to show a prima facie that the President was involved in the proceedings in the course and the continuation of the particular conspiracy that was charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="5615.217" offset="22566393">One is that this is an intra-branch dispute, and that argument would be fully valid under the analogy you use in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.731" offset="22600457">If this were a dispute between, let’s say, two committees in one of the houses of the Congress and one committee sued the other for jurisdiction of a particular matter, you suggest and probably quite correctly, that that would not be a matter for the judiciary to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.274" offset="22730651">That’s one argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5641.216" offset="22730547">That this is purely an Intra-Executive Branch controversy, as it would be between two congressional committees.</text>

            <text syncTime="5657.384" offset="22735040">And then, you have quite a separate argument, it seems to me, i.e. that the President constitutionally is the Chief Prosecutor since he is the executive.</text>

            <text syncTime="5752.932" offset="23117263">It seems to us, briefly, that the case is non-justiciable for somewhat more technical reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.646" offset="23144117">First, this is an issue where if someone has to exercise some discretion, there are no real bounds or standards by which that discretion should be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.392" offset="23203049">And, by traditional standards of this court where that exists, then this Court ought not to take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.877" offset="23237009">Secondly, it seems to me, there is a textual constitutional grant if we assume that the grant of executive power includes the means by which that can be effectively exercised, second ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.602" offset="23291970">Third, of course, there is the political involvement which I have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.419" offset="23311196">Therefore, I suggest quite briefly that even if there is subject matter jurisdiction, the case is non-justiciable for these additional reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5817.024" offset="23373577">The standards of Baker and Carr, and Powell are not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.433" offset="23391236">There are no individual’s rights over being protected against the onslaught of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.904" offset="23417149">The President is not here as an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.469" offset="23423418">He is here as a constitutional officer and whom the executive powers rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.965" offset="23449436">There is no philosophy that would support a finding of justiciability on the grounds that were strengthening the democratic process, as was true in Powell and also into a greater extent in Baker and Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.089" offset="23513907">If anything, a decision in this case against the President would tend to diminish the democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.191" offset="23546298">This President was elected on the theory that he would have all the powers, duties, and responsibilities of any other President.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.098" offset="23573884">And if it’s determined that he doesn’t, there is a certain amount of diminution of the political aspect of the case in so far as the constituents who voted for him are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.643" offset="23636055">This President ought not to have any less powers than any other President ought to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.029" offset="23665626">One of the necessary results, as I view it and my brother’s argument, is that because of the circumstances of this case Richard Nixon is, let’s say, an 85% President not 100% President.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.586" offset="23723827">And, that can’t be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.417" offset="23735216">The framers of the constitution had in mind a strong presidency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.839" offset="23752875">As we know, they considered a number of alternatives, maybe a presidency consisting of three members.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.867" offset="23780982">All of those suggestions were discarded and a strong presidency was decided upon, may I say, to the distinct advantage of this country as history has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5930.800" offset="23828734">Now by reason of an action of a grand jury, the Special Prosecutor suggest that this President has something less than any other President would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.890" offset="23877113">I would only call your attention to the action of the framers in constitutional convention when the issue was raised as to whether or not a President who was under impeachment should be suspended during the pendency of the impeachment proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.037" offset="23933642">And, the decision was definitely he should not because the framers envisioned a strong active President even in the course of impeachment proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.694" offset="23984320">They did not want this country to be led by someone who didn’t have those full powers even if he was then under impeachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="6705.063" offset="26925812">But the fact against opinions and decisions really relate to another situation, as I suggest, in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.310" offset="26958726">But, the conversation that the President has with his advisers, we suggest, is absolutely privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="6796.090" offset="27289854">I think this raises a very important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.999" offset="27305528">There is, of course, an explicit speech and debate immunity in providing the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6805.277" offset="27326635">As our brief indicates, the reason for this is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6808.139" offset="27338129">It’s to protect the legislature from unwarranted invasion from the executive and perhaps the judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.636" offset="27368117">It does not mean that the executive is not entitled to substantially the same thing by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.536" offset="27395702">And at least in the civil field, as we have pointed out, the courts have worked out by implication as a necessary ingredient to the function of the duties of the executive an absolute immunity from civil liability for actions taken within the sphere of the official.</text>
            <text syncTime="6842.413" offset="27475219">Swelling and Violas, I guess, is the leading case as cited and Barr v. Mateo, and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.527" offset="27503640">If such a matter can be worked out with respect to the executive on civil matters, we suggest there is no reason why and, in fact, the court should spell out a similar exemption in criminal matters especially as they relate to the President, himself, because while I said the President is not above the law, the law can only be made applicable to him in a certain way while he is in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6874.725" offset="27604473">Now if a junior congressman can commit a crime on the floor of the House as apparently as possible, under Gravel and Johnson, is it to be said that the President of the United States has less immunity than a junior congressman?</text>
            <text syncTime="6892.630" offset="27676049">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.302" offset="27682736">So that, I suggest to you that common sense and proper construction of the constitution impinged within the grant of executive power all of those necessary ingredients to make it work to be effective which would include immunity and criminal immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6913.587" offset="27759849">The President, we suggest, cannot be indicted, can’t even be named as a co-conspirator because that’s an assumption of a legislative function under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.261" offset="27798615">And, therefore, we suggest that even if this is criminal the President is immune from the ordinary criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6930.985" offset="27829440">He is not immune from process, but that process that’s available to the President is a process of impeachment which does not include the function of the Judiciary Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.189" offset="27874266">And, therefore, we say that if, under Gravel, the congressman is entitled to immunity even from criminal conduct where actions taken within the legislative sphere of his conduct, then it would be very hard to support a proposition that the President, as the Chief Executive of the country, is entitled to less.</text>

            <text syncTime="8387.550" offset="33655686">If I may, I would like to advert first to procedural questions that Mr. Blackmun and Mr. Justice Stewart have raised about whether the mandamus case is properly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="8399.410" offset="33703124">Mr. Justice, we did, in our certiorari petition, refer to the fact that we were trying to bring before the court for review before judgment in the Court of Appeals the order of the District Court which we said the President had tried to obtain review of in two ways in two cases in the Court of Appeals, and we gave the docket numbers of those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="8421.745" offset="33792463">And, that certiorari petition was filed on May 24 and Judge Sirica, who was the respondent as Justice Stewart properly notes in the mandamus case in the Court of Appeals, was served with a copy of the certiorari petition as he had been served with the mandamus petition as, indeed, had all the respondents who were otherwise before the court, the defendants in United States against Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="8449.924" offset="33905208">On May 28 in accordance with a motion that was filed in a Court of Appeals, a copy of which I believe is in the files of this court, the Court of Appeals transmitted to this court the records in both of those cases, the appeal and the mandamus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="8466.332" offset="33970827">Now, Mr. Justice Stewart, with respect to Judge Sirica’s appearance here, he is a party before this court and I believe there is a letter on file with the clerk of this court from Judge Sirica in which he states that he will not appear separately the United States through the Special Prosecutors appearing on behalf of Judge Sirica as, indeed, we would have in the Court of Appeals to uphold his decision enforcing our subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="8490.626" offset="34068003">So the case, procedurally, is properly before the court both with respect to the appeal and the mandamus proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="9374.874" offset="37604982">The issue of Presidential indictability does not determine the issue whether an incumbent President can be named as an unindicted co-conspirator by a grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="9491.920" offset="38073201">We have suggested, however, that although there is some conceivable opportunity for abuse our judicial system, our democratic system, is based on a several fundamental propositions.</text>

            <text syncTime="9513.855" offset="38160973">Even prosecutors cannot be assumed to be malicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="9518.215" offset="38178422">We also assume, as this court regularly holds in First Amendment cases dealing with public officials, that we have a resilient society where people can be trusted to sort out truth from falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="9530.644" offset="38228055">We have a robust debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9533.358" offset="38238922">I submit to you, sir, that just as in this case a grand jury would not likely accuse the President of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="9540.598" offset="38267970">So, to that fear that perhaps without basis some grand jury somewhere might maliciously accuse a President of a crime is not necessarily a compelling reason for saying that a grand jury has no power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="9555.443" offset="38327320">I think the system may be vibrant enough to deal with that and I think the inherent dignity of the Presidential office and any incumbent providing him with a notable check against being defeated or, as my colleague says, impeached by the action of a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="9574.945" offset="38405270">This is perhaps the most notorious event and notorious case in recent times.</text>
            <text syncTime="9582.741" offset="38436512">When the grand jury’s action was disclosed, I venture to say that although it was difficult time for all concerned, including prosecutors as well as other counsel and the President and the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="9724.761" offset="39004623">The answer to my question, Mr. Chief Justice, is yes because these are the procedures that have been set up in the Court of Appeals decision of Nixon versus Sirica which were found to be eminently practical when the tapes subpoenaed by the grand jury were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="9742.057" offset="39073796">These are six-hour reels and, under the so-called index and analysis which the Court of Appeals in that case required to be submitted and which Judge Sirica here has required to be submitted, counsel for the President says this is a six-hour reel.</text>
            <text syncTime="9758.247" offset="39138475">The Watergate-related portions are minutes 312 -- no, that’s too many -- 112 through 146.</text>

            <text syncTime="9783.019" offset="39237636">What has happened is that White House counsel has come to the judge’s chambers with the original reels.</text>
            <text syncTime="9790.670" offset="39268251">They have marked the beginning of the Watergate-related portions on those reels for the court to make his independent determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="9930.602" offset="39827898">The notion that because there is concurrently underway an impeachment inquiry before the House of Representatives that, somehow, makes this a non-justiciable political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="9944.945" offset="39885263">It is, we think, a remarkable notion which is not supported by sound and constitutional law or by any of the decisions of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9952.833" offset="39916819">And indeed, I submit, that to the extent that the court has discretion in the matter and although this court has now been given discretionary certiorari power, District Courts have no such option.</text>
            <text syncTime="9967.116" offset="39973975">It would not even be a wise exercise of discretion for this court to stay its hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="9973.543" offset="39999680">This case before the court is not a request for an opinion between two congressional committees as to who has jurisdiction over a particular bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="9983.862" offset="40040953">It’s not even a request for a dispute between Cabinet Officers or the President and a Cabinet Officer over what proper executive policy ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="9994.675" offset="40084212">This is a criminal proceeding of federal criminal case against six defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="10001.270" offset="40110648">A subpoena had been issued to obtain evidence for use at the trial which is scheduled to begin on September 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="10010.332" offset="40146906">The court cannot escape the fact that this is a trial of tremendous national importance, but a trial that was brought to ahead without regard to the impeachment inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="10024.059" offset="40201763">This is an independent separate constitutional process that is underway, and a traditional prosaic remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="10033.040" offset="40237707">A subpoena has been utilized to obtain evidence for that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="10038.255" offset="40258501">There’s some debate about whether the evidence is critical to our prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="10043.910" offset="40281175">I know that in Justice Rehnquist’s opinion a few weeks ago in Michigan against Tucker that he echoed or presaged perhaps the same point that Judge Sirica made that it’s really the obligation of the prosecution to present all of the material evidence for the jury, for the fact-finder to pass upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="10064.596" offset="40363931">That’s what this case involves.</text>
            <text syncTime="10066.633" offset="40372081">Now to say that there will be public consequences, even political consequences, to the court’s action does not mean this is a political question so that the court must regard it as non-justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="10079.602" offset="40423908">The same argument would have prevented this court from deciding Marbury and Madison.</text>

            <text syncTime="10162.642" offset="40756081">Later, however, when he did go on in 1807 to issue the subpoena to President Jefferson, that was an act of profound political consequences but he stated it again eloquently that it was the court’s duty to obtain evidence if it were material to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="10180.433" offset="40827239">The notion that political consequences should stay the hand of the court is a notion that, again speaking through Marshall, the court rejected in Cohens against Virginia and the Cherokee Nation case where it was common knowledge that the state legislatures in Virginia, in Georgia, would interpose themselves and defy this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10200.408" offset="40907173">And Marshall uttered the words, which I think are justly famous, “just as the court can’t reach out for jurisdiction it doesn’t have, it has an obligation to exercise the jurisdiction it does have whatever may be the political consequences of that act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10214.068" offset="40961822">The court’s action in ex parte Milligan in telling President Lincoln that he did not have the power to conduct the Civil War the way he wanted to conduct it, again, profound political consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="10224.684" offset="41004244">Come to the war power cases in World War II, the Japanese exclusion cases, this court did not say because of the consequences for the President or because of the political reaction to a decision one way or the other the court should stay its hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="10241.273" offset="41070596">In Youngstown, our colleague’s brief closes by quoting Justice Frankfurter’s brilliant concurring opinion saying how the court should, as an institution, be reluctant to decide great constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="10258.526" offset="41139663">But, he went on to say we have an obligation to look into an assertion of Presidential power.</text>
            <text syncTime="10264.028" offset="41161606">And even if the embarrassment to be caused to the President by our disagreeing with him would be profound, it is still the duty of the court to tell him when he’s wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="10275.436" offset="41207268">This court, in Powell against McCormack, how could there be a more political case than telling a House of Congress that it had to see the member that it excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="10286.823" offset="41252826">But, the court said the constitution forbad it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10289.281" offset="41262648">It’s up to the court to decide what the constitution allows, and even though the court interprets the constitution differently from another branch, that’s the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="10300.369" offset="41307056">So, separation of powers here with the notion of political question whether something is committed to the final determination of another branch far from supporting the President’s position demands that the court affirm the action that Judge Sirica has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="10314.793" offset="41364734">This is emphatically the providence of this court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="10322.196" offset="41394305">Not to belabor the point, but perhaps the finest chapter in the court’s recent history has come upon these chapters and had come in the fields of reapportionment, civil rights, and the procedural rights of the criminally accused would be naïve to say that those were not profoundly politically important decisions but they were made as decisions of constitutional law despite the consequences that political branches might face.</text>
            <text syncTime="10359.760" offset="41544561">Despite the public reaction, the court understood its duty to interpret the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="10365.410" offset="41567131">That’s all we ask for today.</text>
            <text syncTime="10368.544" offset="41579670">That’s all Judge Sirica has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="10373.215" offset="41598373">We believe the case is fully justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="10375.901" offset="41609136">We believe the principles that have been briefed by the parties support the correctness of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="10382.318" offset="41634840">And, we submit that this court should fully explicitly and decisively and definitively uphold Judge Sirica’s decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="10402.969" offset="41717387">In response to my brother’s most recent argument, of course Sawyer was an important case with political implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="10411.448" offset="41751347">Of course, the other cases were in it of themselves important cases with political implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="10417.942" offset="41777260">But, this case is different in that the decision in this case will have an undeniable impact on another proceeding in another proceeding which the constitution says is essentially a political proceeding from which the court is excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="10434.877" offset="41845074">And for this court to be drawn into that thicket, if I may call it that, seems to me highly inappropriate at least at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="10443.109" offset="41877988">As I indicated at the outset, the House Committee has made certain political decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="10448.647" offset="41900140">The President has made certain political decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="10452.057" offset="41913724">They will each have to bear the responsibility of those decisions with the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="10457.832" offset="41936816">This court should not impair, interfere with, or otherwise participate directly or indirectly in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="10468.076" offset="41977880">And, it’s inevitable it would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="10472.575" offset="41995853">This courtroom wouldn’t be full today if this were simply a suit on a subpoena brought by the Special Prosecutor against the President even though that would be an important political matter because the President is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="10485.117" offset="42046008">But, this is important for other reasons quite apart from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="10489.257" offset="42062517">Other reasons which I suggest indicate quite clearly that this court ought to, in its discretion and in its judgment, stay its hand at least until such time as those proceedings have run their course because those are political decisions being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="10506.161" offset="42130122">They should not bear the burden either way of a judicial decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="10528.993" offset="42221551">But in any event, the justiciability of this case, seems to be, the single important obvious matter that my brother would prefer not much to talk about, but there can be no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10541.486" offset="42271497">If you read page 59 in his brief, he says “he, the President, is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry by the committee on the judiciary of the House of Representatives and the subpoenaed evidence may have a material bearing on whether he is impeached and, if impeached, whether he is convicted and removed from office.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10561.738" offset="42352476">And, I suggest the constitution in all of the history, the framers makes it quite clear that the framers conceived impeachment as a legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="10573.151" offset="42398138">The court was excluded specifically from that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="10578.909" offset="42421126">Marbury against Madison, itself, I agree with the Chief Justice that it decided the case in favor of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="10586.256" offset="42450592">The rule was discharged and the commission was not issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="10590.257" offset="42466579">But it also helps, and it’s been the law since that case, that the courts will not interfere with or direct a discretionary act on the part of the President or any other branch of government, and that’s been confirmed in Mississippi against Johnson and any case since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="10610.220" offset="42546409">And, the discretion that the constitution by implication and by necessity that has been vested in the President in determining which of his confidential communications shall be made public or released is a discretionary act that this court ought not by its decision to undertake to do for him because this court is not equipped in knowledge, background, or in any other way to exercise that discretion for the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="10636.741" offset="42652467">This is not a ministerial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="10639.614" offset="42663960">Finally, I observe a slight but significant shift in my brother’s position with respect to the prima facie nature of naming of the President as a co-conspirator.</text>
            <text syncTime="10653.033" offset="42717668">I say it can be made now that it can be made prima facie, I take it, that is by examining the evidence before the grand jury in order to determine whether or not that evidence in fact supports that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="10669.522" offset="42783601">We have invited this court and Judge Sirica to do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="10673.904" offset="42801156">The Special Prosecutor has opposed in each instance this or any other court looking behind that to see whether, in fact, the evidence can be made as he now states a position to support a charge of criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="10690.049" offset="42865730">Before the argument, the argument was that because it was a finding or a vote, it was prima facie.</text>
            <text syncTime="10697.929" offset="42897286">Now it is, I take it, somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="10700.767" offset="42908571">But in any event, an action by a grand jury purporting to assess criminality to a President of the United States is a clear intrusion upon the legislative function and power with respect to impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10716.903" offset="42973146">As I said earlier, the President is not above the law nor does he contend that he is, but he does contend that, as President, the law can be applied to him in only one way and that’s by impeachment, not by naming as a co-conspirator in a grand jury indictment, not by indictment, or any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="10735.667" offset="43048169">Therefore, in this case, I urge that this court take such action as is appropriate and overrule Judge Sirica’s decision and order that this case be dismissed.</text>
