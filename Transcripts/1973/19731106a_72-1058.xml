            <text syncTime="41.781" offset="243879">We are here on an appeal for a final judgment of the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.907" offset="268330">This today, is a particularly appropriate day to hear this case involving as it, does voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.378" offset="294243">The question presented is, whether New York may refuse to provide any means of voting, including absentee means for its pretrial detainees and misdemeanants under circumstances when first, such persons are called by voters, not disenfranchised by any State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.212" offset="365610">Secondly, absentee voting rights are extended to persons medically unable to appear in person and to whole wrath of persons unable to, unavoidably absent from their county of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.061" offset="412944">New York has advanced no overriding governmental interest, whatsoever in this proceeding at any stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.906" offset="436349">The facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.798" offset="439902">Appellants are a class of 72 qualified voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.920" offset="460382">In the fall of 1972, they were confined to the Mineral County jail as persons convicted of minor crimes, not any felonies, or as pretrial detainees, un-convicted of any crimes, whatsoever, for awaiting trial and unable to post bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.757" offset="527778">They are voting at age, they have legal residencies in Mineral County.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.282" offset="545855">I must stress that these persons are qualified to vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.089" offset="785136">I know that the statute has not been construed and this is often raised in any Court proceeding that I am aware of but the statute is quite broad and a class of persons that can vote, that are out of county, it includes people that are out of county by reason of their occupation, their duties, their employment, persons that are out of county by reason of a vacation, a wife of a person who is out of county by reason of his occupation, that wife can vote and the statute is quite broad and I believe that it would cover people in the same session that our people are in, if they happen to be outside the county of their legal residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.353" offset="934139">There is also, in New York State, a program of mobile registration which would permit volunteer registrars to setup branch offices for registration in various locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.789" offset="975935">In the fall of 1972, this was done at various shopping centers, at schools, in fact the volunteer for registrars were willing to setup facilities in the visiting areas of the Mineral county jail and registrar inmates of the jail in that fashion and the Sheriff denied their request.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.378" offset="1118250">One is simply the ballots or some means of voting on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.473" offset="1134655">But of course to be able to vote, you have to be registered, so we are also raising the question of whether, inmates of the jail can be registered by absentee means, or by some other means that they can have at the jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.190" offset="1233502">They are almost identical to the means, by which people can get absentee ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.186" offset="1253460">You can get or you can register by absentee if you are confined in a hospital or an institution or home, by a reason of a medical disability.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="306.266" offset="1301838">I asked question because the State with which I – the only stated really if I have any basic familiarity, requires registration personnel, though it has very, very liberal absentee voting provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.646" offset="1351367">That's not true in yours?</text>

            <text syncTime="319.515" offset="1354815">That is not true, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.022" offset="1364846">Now Your Honor, the two lower courts construed the absentee registration at balloting statutes in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.601" offset="1391177">They say that, then the key term was physical disability and they found, there are people who are physically disabled in a sense that they physically could not get to the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.294" offset="1421897">They thus avoided the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.929" offset="1432451">New York, Court of Appeals then reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.332" offset="1442064">They dismissed the petition that we have filed and which in we have broadly asked for any sort of relief available under State law and they left us with no possibility of relief whatsoever, under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.050" offset="1480934">They rejected all means of voting in person, they construed the statute, and they ruled against our constitutional claims that we had raised in every single stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.104" offset="1509146">So the question now is quite clear cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.512" offset="1522834">We are contending simply that the State interests that are asserted in support of these classifications in the statutes, are not the kind of State interest that justify the denial of fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.558" offset="1566929">It's as simple as that and I think that decisions of this Court make it quite clear that when you have a fundamental right such as voting, then you take a hard --</text>

            <text syncTime="408.311" offset="1709976">I think, that there is at least one, and that is the right to vote, that is the most fundamental of all rights, because this is preservative of every single right that person might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.729" offset="1755638">I think that this was recognized in the Rodriguez case in the last term, where the footnote says very clearly, that at least, voting rights are considered fundamental in the sense that they are grounded in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.761" offset="1815824">So I think that what we are talking about here are rights that are very important and that has never been a question of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.497" offset="2566687">The impact on fundamental rights was different, because in the record in the McDonald case, there was no showing that the state would not provide the alternative means of voting that we have requested, in this case had been denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.274" offset="6845858">Further, we feel that there is not really a class here that would come in the ambit of the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment because you really don't have a legal class as such.</text>
