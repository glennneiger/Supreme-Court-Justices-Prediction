            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ll resume arguments in Number 1517, and Mr. Levin, I think you have about seven minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Levin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="17.099" offset="145136">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.941" offset="160496">I have only two further points that I’d like to make with respect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.927" offset="188500">We have provided the Court with an addendum to petitioners’ reply brief which is some 152 pages in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.519" offset="226847">Now, all of this evidence found in this addendum was introduced in Judge Johnson’s court in the District Court in the 1970 phase of the Gilmore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.878" offset="264255">That’s the phase that dealt with equalization of public recreational facilities in Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.150" offset="285362">This present litigation, that is this motion for supplemental relief in the Gilmore case, was initiated less than eight months after the order of the court approving the agreement between the petitioners and the city in that Gilmore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.274" offset="349832">These facts are material because they were before Judge Johnson by virtue of his authority to take judicial notice of his own court records, and because the testimony therein would have clearly supported the injunction with respect to private segregated clubs and organizations used of public recreational facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.258" offset="429767">I think the keyword in examining these facts is “shift.”</text>
            <text syncTime="94.377" offset="454217">There was a shift of white recreational programs which were formally in the province solely of the city and the recreation department to private clubs and organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.798" offset="495909">So the city maintained control only over the black recreational programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.335" offset="518060">Now Mayor James himself, at the addendum page 19 (a), who was the mayor at the time that all these went on, admitted that the YMCA City Coordination Agreement which we discussed yesterday, and this is a quote, controlled, quote, “Not only the YMCA but also the Boy’s Club and all of the others.”</text>
            <text syncTime="129.632" offset="595278">So, the shift was not only to the segregated YMCA, but in the Addendum 7588 4a you’ll see it was to a white Babe Ruth League, to a white Dixie Youth League parallel to Little League which was a Black League, to the White City Club Softball teams, and to the White Church League Softball teams.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.891" offset="668317">These private segregated clubs are making use of public recreational facilities, extensive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.200" offset="693499">The result is a resegregation of recreational facilities in Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.876" offset="716278">And even if one ignores the specific finding in Smith versus YMCA, that this was done with the intent to avoid desegregation of public recreational facilities, certainly, the foreseeable result of these activities would’ve been to resegregate those facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.511" offset="778762">I’d like to make one final comment on exclusive use which we discussed with respect to the private segregated school situation yesterday, and that is that it’s not simply some abstract theory that the Fifth Circuit discussed in support of a legal doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.110" offset="837172">The District Court was specifically instructed to include the Exclusive Use Doctrine in its new injunction on remand, and this it did and that’s found at page 29 (a) of the appendix.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="200.784" offset="879909">I suppose that reflects the judicial practice of this Court following Brown versus Board of Education entering orders, making parks and like public places open to members of the minority races.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="261.356" offset="1122220">And I suppose that’s reflected in the Court of Appeals’ approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.288" offset="1157851">Up to that time, many of the parks in some areas of the country get -- have been turned over exclusively, you know to the dominant race.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Levin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="281.191" offset="1201528">Well, of course that was the same situation that existed in Montgomery in 1959 when the initial Gilmore case was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.113" offset="1229218">However, the Fifth Circuit, as best I recall, did not discuss, that may have been an underlying reason but it was not discussed in the opinion, and exclusive use seem to be directed more at ensuring that individual students or individual citizens did not become subjected to an exclusion from public recreational facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.896" offset="1312287">But of course, the District Court’s order never -- there’s nothing in the District Court’s order which would’ve done that anyhow and that was why I couldn’t understand the reason for the exclusive use doctrine being incorporated into a -- in the Fifth Circuit’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.903" offset="1380310">I think that as a matter of law, that it’s erroneous but it is the law in the Fifth Circuit now.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="331.330" offset="1402044">Alright, well, I think, historically, it was the practice that this Court in its early decisions on recreational facilities that the Fifth Circuit struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.505" offset="1458782">It’s not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.462" offset="1462648">It’s everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.818" offset="1472052">With the exception of private segregate -- when you’re assisting private segregated schools and thereby detracting from the public school system in a peculiar situation that you have in the south and in Montgomery then of course, you enter into another area where you can’t give support.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.066" offset="1528999">You can’t enhance the programs of these private segregated academies.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.477" offset="1566616">If five or six young men or 11 young men came down individually to play football or volleyball or whatever, they could come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.515" offset="1610815">But if they came down in the uniforms of the private school playing in connection with an intramural athletic program, they could not use the facility, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="400.833" offset="1680091">Individually, there's no difficulty and we’ve never -- certainly, we never make any attempt to keep any citizen out of public recreational facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.458" offset="1706632">That’s never been the point, but as a school-initiated program either curriculum or athletic program, it would be prohibited under our theory of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.340" offset="1966080">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.434" offset="1978514">At the outset, I’d like to clarify just a little bit concerning the record in the case and specifically the reply brief that the petitioners filed last week in which they attach depositions or parts or parts of depositions as addendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.227" offset="2053642">Now, these depositions were taken, as Mr. Levin pointed out, in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.109" offset="2077153">I think may -- it may be well to go in and look at the sequence or chronology of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.930" offset="2108500">It was -- original complaint, as pointed out by Mr. Levin, was December 28, 1958 or order posed in the case by the District Court on April 22, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.193" offset="2153535">Then in 1970, on August 12, 1970, the petitioners filed a motion to cite for contempt and for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.103" offset="2189166">And in that August 12, 1970 motion they did raise the issue of this resegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.577" offset="2215079">They raised the issue of the YMCA case which been decided a month before.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.819" offset="2235977">It was pursuant to that hearing that these depositions were taken or it was pursuant to that motion that these depositions were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.910" offset="2264398">And that case resulted in the joint filing of a plan for extensive improvement of recreational facilities throughout the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.716" offset="2299611">Montgomery, as many other communities, we had recreation facilities in one part of town that weren't as good as another.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.874" offset="2328242">Some in the black community, one is good as some of the white.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.229" offset="2341616">Some in -- some portions of the white, one is good in some portions as the black, but be that as it may, the city, by a joint motion agreed to equalize all facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.610" offset="2379233">We had just finished a community center at the time the filing of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.474" offset="2394593">It was completed about that time in a lower income in Negro area.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.288" offset="2409848">But be that as it may, we say facilities ought to be as good as we can possibly make them all over town, we agreed to do that and Judge Johnson approved this plan and found that was dispositive of all the issues before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.297" offset="2465959">And that was in December of 1971 when the District Court said that the joint plan disposed of all issues before the court, and that appears in the appendix, in the very outset when the chronology of the case is set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.964" offset="2528653">Then, far than that and after all those issues were disposed of in September of 1971, the petitioners came along and filed a petition for supplemental relief and that’s the basic -- basis of this present proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.725" offset="2583615">Now, the basis for the supplemental relief was largely, and I think, a fair reading of it discloses that it dealt with private schools and private academies.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.047" offset="2624888">Let’s go for a moment and look at the depositions that Mr. Levin attaches to his reply brief, and he includes, and I think very significantly, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.929" offset="2672431">If you look back at those depositions, I skip from page 20 to page 40, in some instances and a whole lot of them are omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.137" offset="2701270">Now, we didn’t have enough -- he didn’t designate these as part of his appendix and, of course, we had no opportunity to counter designate so we have had delivered to the Clerk’s Office the entire deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.474" offset="2746619">And, we’ve asked the court if they deem these depositions -- if the court deems these depositions appropriate before the court, all of them should certainly be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.059" offset="2777025">For example, he talks about segregated Babe Ruth, but on page 15 of a deposition of Mr. McKean and he omitted this from the part he put back in this addendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.643" offset="2819344">As far as Babe Ruth is specific in here, it says no distinction be made between black and white, absolutely not.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.324" offset="2846093">There has never been any distinction in as far as Babe Ruth Leagues, nationally or from the state, no distinction with regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.471" offset="2874619">That’s omitted from what he’s got here, but we have delivered it to the Clerk’s Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.261" offset="2889770">Mr. McKean said they put out notices at all schools for children who want to play Babe Ruth or boys who want to play Babe Ruth to come and attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.780" offset="2919863">Dixie Youth, he mentioned that this morning, he mentioned that in his addendum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.181" offset="7697450">Mr. Levin says that Montgomery, Alabama should be treated apart from other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.274" offset="7725871">He says that, for some reason, there’s something different about the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.333" offset="7758054">This community and in this area struggled with problems of desegregation and removal of discriminatory practices, and we feel that when we come before this Court and say that we are open, that our facilities are open to all, that’s not an empty promise or just a statement, its documented by the facts as they exist right in Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.801" offset="7847915">For example, two members of the respondent board that are before this Court today are black leaders in Montgomery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.788" offset="8815909">I agree with you, sir that the District Court does know that we have got two black members on the Board and it comes out and publicized in the press that a black man is heading all of the recreational programs throughout the City of Montgomery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.925" offset="8884454">They want to use the vehicle of this desegregation case to go into all of the admissions policies of various groups regardless of the size, composition, or purpose of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.662" offset="8935445">We don’t feel, in this case, on remand or otherwise that this is a proper vehicle to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.167" offset="8961463">The head of a group that they brought before the court is the YMCA, and the court found YMCA really wasn’t private because they are all encompassing membership and therefore, and the connection that the city and the white cooperating, an order was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.724" offset="9027605">If they have any examples that they feel like the city is using or using the city for subterfuge, those part is -- they are just -- as Mr. Justice Black said in Palmer versus Thompson, ought to be before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.828" offset="9080059">We respectfully submit to the Court that the two he mentions today, the Babe Ruth and the Dixie League, are not discriminatory as is evidenced by the portions of the depositions that he didn’t include.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.130" offset="9129273">But this case is not the vehicle, we respectfully submit, to go in and to put a municipality on the basis of defending its relation with all types of private groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.934" offset="9176503">We think that in Burton, the Court envisioned a shifting and analysis of circumstances and with the broad spectrum that they seek here, we say that this case is not the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.863" offset="9228225">As Mr. Justice -- Chief Justice Burger stated in Norwood versus Harrison, no presumptions flow from mere allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.015" offset="9256856">No one can be required, consistent with due process, to prove absence of violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.906" offset="9276395">If they’ve got a specific, they’ve got judicial retorts, but better than that, better than that if they’ve got something that they feel like is re-segregating, if they will bring it to the attention of the Park and Recreation Board of the City of Montgomery, if they will bring it to the attention of the Biracial Park and Recreation Board, I think it’ll be remedied and I state that it‘ll be remedied without the necessity of judicial intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.025" offset="9372839">I think that’s the posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.494" offset="9382766">That’s the posture of what Montgomery, Alabama is trying to do.</text>
