            <label>Mr. George J. Tichy, II</label>
            <text syncTime="33.613" offset="211174">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.218" offset="221623">This case arises out in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and presents three major issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.630" offset="243252">These are, whether or not Section 1450, the Federal Removal Statute takes precedence over state law concerning the effective period of a removed state court injunctive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.704" offset="283585">Secondly, whether Section 1450 takes precedence over conflicting provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure and thirdly, whether or not, the denial of a motion to dissolve a removed state court restraining order is tantamount to the issuance of a preliminary injunction for purposes of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.543" offset="354952">The facts in this case arise out of a contractual dispute in a labor situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.717" offset="375641">Teamsters’ Local 70 and the companies involved here had for many years, been parties of National Master Freight Agreement and the Local 70 Supplemental Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.873" offset="412212">Preparatory to 1970 negotiations, the National Food Industry Negotiating Committee of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters notified that the companies that the Union Committee desire to negotiate changes and revisions in the existing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.028" offset="468846">The critical provision here is that the notice did not terminate the existing agreements but they did continue in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.662" offset="499357">The Union, Teamsters Local 70, was most desirous to break away from national negotiations and to impose a new independent agreement where the company is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.307" offset="538018">The vehicle which used to enforce this approach was a work stoppage, initially against Granny Goose Foods and Sunshine Biscuits, and normally against standard brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.391" offset="578351">The companies believed that because it was compulsory grievance procedures and the collective-bargaining agreements, that the matter should be resolved in accordance with the grievance procedures rather than through work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.203" offset="621610">Consequently, when the strike continued to persist, Granny Goose Foods and Sunshine Biscuits went into state court to seek a restraining order against the illegal strike activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.488" offset="674691">In advance of the hearing, the attorney for Local 70 was notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.089" offset="693081">He in fact appeared before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.975" offset="700604">He presented arguments to the court that he believed that the contract had not been breached, that there was no basis for a restraining order but despite the existence of these arguments, a restraining order was in fact issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.577" offset="755043">Thereafter the picketing of work stoppage expanded to standard branch, where standard branch of course joined as a party plaintiff and the litigation went to court inside of modified temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.146" offset="805303">But prior to the application, again Local 70’s attorney was advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.451" offset="822544">He did not personally appear in Alameda County there’s a practice that no labor injunction will issue unless the Labor Union’s attorney has a chance to make the position of the Union known.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.452" offset="866534">The court thereupon insisted the counsel for the Union be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.267" offset="881789">It was reached in his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.664" offset="887432">The judge talked with him over the phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.930" offset="896418">The Union’s attorney advised he was relying on the same arguments and initially presented when Granny Goose Foods and Sunshine Biscuits appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.863" offset="928183">After hearing the argument of counsel, the judge then granted the modified restraining order which is an issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.371" offset="970188">The date of the modified restraining order was May 18, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.653" offset="991399">And that has significance to this Court in the Boys Markets versus Retail Clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.044" offset="1008953">It was up before this Court and no decision have been rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.816" offset="1024000">The Union believes that Atkinson versus Sinclair was still the law with regard to federal injunctive orders incite to have the matter removed to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.581" offset="1059109">And what has to be a classic case of forum shopping, the Union filed a petition, removed the action to federal court hoping to rely on Atkinson versus Sinclair to dissolve the restraining order, and an essence to abate the entire action and proceedings that occurred in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.916" offset="1124415">When the motions came on for hearing, it was the position of the company’s that Atkinson versus Sinclair was that the applicable law this court having indicated enough code that it may review the application of Atkinson versus Sinclair and having before it Boys Market.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.105" offset="1189198">We relied on the arguments which were being presented to this Court the Boys Market.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.411" offset="1206439">The judge took the matter under submission and on June 4, 1970, seventeen days after the issuance of the modified temporary restraining order, the district judge denied the motion to dissolve thereby continuing the order in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.158" offset="1277388">It’s important to note, that between June 4, 1970 and December 1, 1970, no answer or responsive pleading was ever filed by the Union in this particular case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="311.659" stopTime="324.925">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="311.659" offset="1323363">When you say that the judge by denying the motion to dismiss or to dissolve thereby continued the order in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.657" offset="1355337">That really is one of the arguments that you are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.649" offset="1367353">That is not an obvious conclusion just a statement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_j_tichy_ii" startTime="324.925" stopTime="401.587">
            <label>Mr. George J. Tichy, II</label>
            <text syncTime="324.925" offset="1376444">Well, I think there are two points to be made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.268" offset="1397864">One is, that the contempt proceedings in the Court and moving on a motion raised by the Union, that Section 527 in a state law applied, thereby causing abatement of the order after 15 days replied and I quote, “I am satisfied that my ruling of June 4 in which I denied the motion to dissolve on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction continues in full force and affect the orders.”</text>
            <text syncTime="352.266" offset="1485845">So the first thing we have is the judge’s own intention as submitted in the contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.599" offset="1507161">Secondly, and this of course, gets to my argument, but I’ll address myself to it at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.619" offset="1527223">We are talking about really two concepts when you distinguish between a restraining order and a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.603" offset="1555122">In a restraining order situation, generally speaking, you wouldn’t have notice or opportunity defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.363" offset="1582184">But in this particular case, we believe that that did exists but this primary distinction between a preliminary injunction, and a temporary restraining order has noticed an opportunity to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.596" offset="1623144">In the case of the motion to dissolve the restraining order, the Union filed the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.700" offset="1639549">In fact, I had an order short in time for the hearing on that particular proceeding and an essence had adequate notice by its ordered mission in seeking the proceedings and obviously had the opportunity to defend.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="401.587" stopTime="443.655">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="401.587" offset="1683122">But I'm -- my reading on the record and you may certainly correct me if I am wrong, is that the Union’s basic position on the motion to dissolve, was that Sinclair against Atkinson prevented the continuance of this restraining order, not as a matter of discretion, but simply because of the Norris-La Guardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.460" offset="1770580">And I don’t make perhaps quite as easily as you do the jump that sort of a hearing is the same thing as if the Union had come in and move to dissolve a temporary restraining order on the merits in effect before the time set for the hearing on the temporary injunction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_j_tichy_ii" startTime="443.655" stopTime="478.377">
            <label>Mr. George J. Tichy, II</label>
            <text syncTime="443.655" offset="1851350">Your Honor, the choice rest entirely with the Union as to which argument it wish to present on a motion to dissolve the restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.185" offset="1893460">Now I could have raised an issue as to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.870" offset="1904222">It could have controverted the factual issues but it did not do so and chose to rely exclusively an Atkinson versus Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.003" offset="1936718">And the fact that it chose to rely on a narrow tactical approach of this, did not deprive of the opportunity which is a critical point I believe to defend on whatever point it felt would best defeat the existence of the restraining order.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="478.377" stopTime="497.405">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="478.377" offset="1990217">But of course, even if they have never made any motion, it’s still fair to say they would have had the opportunity to defend their rules, give them the authority to come in and move to dissolve a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.567" offset="2035043">Is that enough just the fact that they have the opportunity to do it, to convert a temporary restraining order into preliminary injunction?</text>

            <label>Mr. George J. Tichy, II</label>
            <text syncTime="497.405" offset="2066390">Your Honor, in this case, the issue that was relied upon by the Court of Appeals in vacating the contempt judgment was the fact that Section 527 in the California Code of Civil Procedure apparently imposed some sort of 20-day limitation on the duration of State Court Orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.482" offset="2158655">Now, this particular section, applies only to orders issued without notice and we believe that there was adequate notice in this case if in fact the Court had reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.891" offset="2200346">But more importantly than this, the law in California is that where you have proceedings which continue the order in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.985" offset="2232738">And they take into account such things as merely getting a continuance on a hearing on a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.183" offset="2253531">In fact cases which are cited by the respondents in this situation rely or which are relied upon by the respondents in this particular case, include cases where the court specifically note that you can continue the restraining order through all this other types of proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.494" offset="2662713">If the Court of Appeals were correct, it would require federal courts and all of the 50 jurisdictions and 50 states in which they sought to go into a wholesale witch-hunt to determine what state law was in terms of restraining orders and then you have the complex ambiguities which are present in this case resolving and conflicting interpretations which might exist, despair treatment through out the Federal Judiciary in a vast ways to federal time involved in state questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.909" offset="2772428">That’s why Congress when it enacted Section 1450 dealt specifically with regard to the duration of removed orders making it to continue in effect subject only to dissolution of modification to avoid this wholesale investigation that would be imposed upon the Federal Judiciary in cases removed from state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.758" offset="2855811">We believe that the particular statute in this case, 1450 is clear on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.646" offset="2887367">It talks first of all in terms of all injunctions.</text>

            <text syncTime="809.803" offset="3315984">That’s right, Your Honor because it transferred the burden of proceeding because the Union could defend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.462" offset="3338553">We don’t even have to talk about it in a Labor Management context.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.306" offset="3349943">The defendant is the only person that can remove an injunctive proceeding to a federal court because a complaint for injunctive relief would be directed the answer to defendant and only the defendant has a right under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.850" offset="3396127">Because he is broken up to process, the law transfers the burden from the plaintiff to the defendant to bring the issue before the Court because the plaintiff would have brought the issue before the Court under his original order has been deprived of that because the action of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.488" offset="3478674">We believe that with regard to Section 1450, there are some additional factors which may assist the Court in its interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.584" offset="3515037">In this regard it’s significant to note that there are attachment provisions in Section 1450 which Congress specifically makes the enforcement subject to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.553" offset="3570939">It’s obvious in drafting 1450 Congress had its command the language to make a state court order, subject to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.714" offset="3607615">However, it did not do so with regard to injunctives and retraining orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.336" offset="3630080">The only conclusion that can be reached is not making it referable to state law that Congress intended that the specific language of 1450 would apply under the restraining order would continue in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.015" offset="3696849">Now, just to add some emphasis if I could to my position, that this would involve the Court in some sort of wholesale involvement and the interpretation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.846" offset="3740108">It’s significant to note that there at least three major arguments that could be made in a support of the position that 527 did not cause this particular order to dissolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.458" offset="3782531">First of all, 527 applies only to orders issued without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.833" offset="3800085">In this case definitely, I could be made that this was a restraining order issue with notice. Additionally, 527 does not cause an order to expire automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.453" offset="3846583">If there is some act of continuance in this case we believe the denial to motion to dissolve was an essence of type of action which resolved in a continuants.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.931" offset="3888483">And more importantly, you have here in this particular situation, a 15-day statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.575" offset="3915024">Now, at the time of the June 4th order it was 17 days after the issuance of the modified restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.873" offset="3940206">And the judge entered into some sort of speculative wishful thinking that the order would have continued in effect for 20 days rather than 15 days and it’s in fact it assumed the order was in effect on June 4, there is but one reason that it could have been in effect on June 4 and it was not Section 527 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, it was 1450 which we rely on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.025" offset="4036859">We also believe that 1450 must take precedence over the federal rules and several procedure more particularly Rule 65 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.012" offset="4080744">In this regard, we rely on 28 U.S.C. Section 2071, which provides that the rules of this Court and of other courts must be consistent with acts of Congress to the extent if any, that there is a conflict between Rule 65 (b), and Section 1450, then of course under 28 U.S.C. 2071 1450 would prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.695" offset="4187533">Furthermore, 1450 is specifically directed to remove orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.796" offset="4215954">Rule 65 (b) is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.128" offset="4229224">It is resting in the note that neither the legislative history of Rule 65 (b) nor the legislative history of 1450 would suggest that somehow or another that 1450 was in any respect to be subservient to Rule 65 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.666" offset="4291396">And furthermore, even if 65 (b) did apply in this case, it applies only to situations where there is an order issued without notice and as we indicated previously we believe that there was efficient notice in this particular case to dispense any of the time limits set forth in 65 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.693" offset="4371540">In summation, we believe that 1450 should prevail over state laws as well as Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with regard to the duration of a removed state court restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.203" offset="4417515">That even if this Court were to engage in analysis of the state law or the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 (b), that the order would have still continue in effect and the contempt proceedings would have been appropriate at the time they occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.954" offset="4472581">And furthermore, that the denial of the motion to dissolve the restraining order was tantamount to the issuance of the preliminary injunction for purposes of continuing the injunction effect for enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.130" offset="4525244">And these grounds, jointly and alternatively, we submit the decision of the Court of Appeals should be vacated and that the contempt judgment issued by the District Court should be reinstated in its entirety.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.071" offset="4725029">The basis upon which the petitioners seek to sustain that finding which was over turned by the court below, is that Section 1450 of Title 28 converted the temporary retraining order of the state which is I say was issued without a hearing into an order of unlimited duration so that it continued on in perpetuity until such time as the federal court might act on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.643" offset="10047321">The interpretation of such Section 1450, which is involved in this case, is one which has general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.720" offset="10079608">Section 1450 applies to all classes of cases, labor cases as well as the one that is governed by Norris-La Guardia as well as a case generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.141" offset="10117329">And it is appropriate to examine Section 65 (b) and Norris-La Guardia Act to see what policy considerations there are that might help us construe Section 1450.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.488" offset="10174694">And those considerations in brief are that temporary restraining orders are not to be permitted to endure indefinitely without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.692" offset="10215549">And Section 1450 plainly lends itself to a reading of that kind and it is perfectly obvious as Mr. Tichy has conceded that if you do not read it, Section 1450 in that way, you are confronted with the conflict between the meaning of Section 65 (b) and Norris-La Guardia in appropriate case on one hand, and Section 1450 on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.834" offset="10304052">We are suggesting a reading which is supported not only by the language of purpose of Section 1450 but also one which is congruent with the policy that we find in other areas of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.339" offset="10378136">The remaining point which I would like to deal with briefly is the contention that even though we may be right, with respect to our view of Section 1450, that the ruling on the motion to dissolve converted the restraining order into a preliminary injunction so that from that point on, there was a preliminary injunction in effect and that would have the consequence of continuing the restraint irrespective of what may have happen to the temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.464" offset="10538632">Now, this consequence is not one which I believe the District Court judge thought that he was dealing with when he denied the order to dissolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.673" offset="10607491">He made very clear, that he felt that he was simply construing Section 1450 to keep that the – strike that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.738" offset="10659736">He felt that the only issue that he was ruling on, was the narrow issue of Sinclair against Atkinson which was raised by the motion to dissolve, which had to do only with whether or not there was jurisdiction to maintain that order in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.067" offset="10725042">And there is nothing to indicate that he felt that he was doing anymore than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.769" offset="11511850">Copies of the documents were served on Mr. Silbart shortly before the hearing before Judge Locero.</text>

            <text syncTime="2869.716" offset="11555631">And that there was breach of contract and that the court should not grant the temporary restraining order despite argument by defendant’s Counsel Judge Locero granted the temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.264" offset="11633789">The same matter is contained on pages 50 and 51, also, one of my affidavits in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.136" offset="11669316">If I can impress the Court of one thing, I wish to impress it of this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.116" offset="11689169">We do not believe that labor injunctions are matters which are easily obtained in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.783" offset="11715918">There are very rigorous procedures which are followed because very basically, the San Francisco Bay Area is a labor area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.543" offset="11742877">And we follow these rules when we go into court to get these injunctive orders, and when the attorney for the Union comes down there and he has his people in the courtroom before he goes in to see the judge and he says there are strikers and there are in strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.783" offset="11791882">He goes and makes the best arguments that he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.607" offset="11803167">And in this case, he contended that the restraining order, excuse me -- that the contract was of no force in effect and therefore was not being breach and therefore that there was no temporary restraining order which should be ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.540" offset="11854890">Under the circumstances, in light of the fact that there was an initial complaint and initial hearing, then an amendment of the complaint just to add an additional party plaintiff that the matter was discussed with the counsel for the Union in advance of the hearing, that the Court in fact made a telephonic communication with the counsel for the Union before the hearing -- before the restraining order was issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.378" offset="12494263">Well, Your Honor, I believe that the Court in those particular cases felt that on the motion to dissolve that that opportunity was given to the defendant to raise the issues which were in defense that the restraining order was efficiently particular on its face so that the motion denying the -- or the denial of the motion to dissolve is tantamount to the reinstatement of the restraining order was a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.683" offset="12591438">Now in these cases, one additional point that should be kept in mind, with regards to the possibility of findings, it is interesting to note that there was no answer and oppose it any time in this particular case even up through the situation where contempt judgment was awarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.210" offset="12773564">And the issues that were presented in terms of our request for restraining order in terms of the motion to dissolve and the issues of contempt proceedings are very, very fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.893" offset="12816300">In the case of the restraining order what we were talking about was: number one was there contract in effect and number two was there a grievance procedure, and number three was there a strike?</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.861" offset="12852140">When we got to the motion to dissolve, the only issue which the Union chose to raise was whether or not, Atkinson versus Sinclair replied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.020" offset="12880875">And when we got to the contempt proceedings, the only issue was whether or not, there was in fact a strike occurring at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.549" offset="12910968">Now all of these things were totally uncontroverted particularly at the contempt stage when no contrary evidence was presented or whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.944" offset="12948480">So the fundamental factual issues were always undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.527" offset="12962900">It was a legal impact to be given to those particular facts which was this positive as far as the core was concerned whether or not a restraining order should be issued initially whether or not the motion to dissolve should be denied, and whether or not a contempt judgment should be entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.712" offset="13575628">I wish to raise a couple additional points before my time runs out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.594" offset="13591092">First of all, in the brief to the Court of Appeals, the respondents contended that this was a Boys Market case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.115" offset="13613244">It wasn’t until they filed the brief in this matter before this Court that they raise the issue that this might not be a Boys Market case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.135" offset="13641247">The issue was never litigated before and under Rule 41 (d) and (e) of the Supreme Court, it is not properly before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.441" offset="13674475">Furthermore, I wish to emphasize that if it were to analyze Boys Market and answer implications from the policy standpoint of this case, but let’s keep in mind that this is a 301 suit, that was removed from state court to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.227" offset="13729646">And from the time of Lincoln Mills, the time of Boys Market it's always been recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.530" offset="13750857">This has been the purpose of 301 to define state courts of jurisdiction on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.918" offset="13772382">And if we were now to impose those La-Guardia standards on every state court removed injunctive order which are more stringent than state court, it would have a natural effect of disposing a state court jurisdiction because Unions would in every case will move the matter to federal court where they could have more stringent procedure rules which the employer or the companies would have to meet when they sought to maintain an injunctive or a restraining order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.131" offset="13917309">And I think that when this Court ruled on Boys Market, it recognized that there was this conflict between state law and federal law and that was one of the reasons why the Boys Market decision overturn Atkinson versus Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.473" offset="13966629">We believe that Section 1450 is in fact this positive in this particular case that the problems that we have had to go through here today analyzing state law or indicative of the problems of the entire judiciary would have to go through with every removed restraining order injunctive order case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.085" offset="14033084">Consequently, we believe that 1450 should prevail over state laws as well as Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.673" offset="14059416">And furthermore, that the denial of the motion to dissolve the restraining order was tantamount to the issuance of a preliminary injunction for purposes of enforcement.</text>
