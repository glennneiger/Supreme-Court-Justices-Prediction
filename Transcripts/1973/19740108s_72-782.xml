            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">Number 72-782, Gateway Coal against United Mine Workers, involves a dispute between Gateway Coal operating a mine in Pennsylvania and the UMW.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.787" offset="139912">Certain foremen were suspended for falsifying records as to airflow conditions in the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.524" offset="170841">When the company reinstated the foremen pursuant to authorization from State Authorities, the union employees walked out to protest the alleged safety hazard created by the return of the discharged foremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.491" offset="242730">The union refused to arbitrate the dispute, contending that an issue of mine safety was not subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.867" offset="284212">The company brought suit under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.832" offset="312111">It contended that the broad arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement governed the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.466" offset="342622">The District Court issued a preliminary injunction against continuation of the strike and ordered arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.968" offset="372611">In addition, the court suspended the foremen pending the decision in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.616" offset="403226">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.051" offset="416914">The case is here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.765" offset="431856">The arbitration clause expressly covers any local trouble of any kind arising at the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.298" offset="465920">The clause is broad enough to encompass dispute, although that was no express agreement not the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.411" offset="502387">The prior decisions of this Court have held that a contractual duty to arbitrate, gives rise to an implied no strike obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.221" offset="549616">The union relied on Section 502 of the Act which provides that the quiting of the employees in good faith because of abnormal and dangerous conditions shall not be deemed a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.646" offset="607295">We conclude, however, that under the circumstances of this case, 502 is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.223" offset="637597">We conclude further that the District Court had authority to enforce the no strike obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.168" offset="665391">We noted that suspension by the District Court of the foremen in question, pending filed arbitration had eliminated any threat of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.650" offset="707396">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.460" offset="722547">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
