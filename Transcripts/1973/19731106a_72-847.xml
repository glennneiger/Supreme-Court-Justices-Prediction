            <text syncTime="57.091" offset="305110">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.296" offset="317962">This case is before you on appeal from the Supreme Court of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.149" offset="337293">The issue before you is the constitutionality of an Arizona statute that denies medical care at public expense to residents who have not been residents a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.674" offset="391419">This Court presumably has taken jurisdiction of this case because the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court in upholding the constitutionality of that requirement was in direct conflict with the three-judge District Court sitting in Arizona which invalidated the identical provision as a denial of equal protection and an infringement on their right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.205" offset="477518">The decision of the court below is in almost is direct conflict with a determination of this Court in affirming a District Court decision in Arizona which invalidated a similar durational residence requirements for mental health care in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.650" offset="547318">The case arises here because in 1971, a man named Henry Evaro moved from the State of New Mexico to that State of Arizona, intending to make Arizona his home and his residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.377" offset="606250">About six weeks after he moved to Arizona, he became very seriously ill with an acute respiratory illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.225" offset="637597">He was gasping for breath.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.483" offset="646687">It’s been stipulated below he clearly required medical attention to restore his health.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.419" offset="666436">He went to his private doctor, but his private doctor told him, he needed hospitalization and referred him to a private hospital, Memorial Hospital, the appellant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.945" offset="704575">When he went to Memorial Hospital, the hospital determined that he was indigent and asked under their appropriate procedures, the county hospital either take Mr. Evaro as a patient, give him treatment there or that the county reimburse Memorial Hospital for the cost which it would expend in giving Mr. Evaro treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.051" offset="776986">The county refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.769" offset="787853">In doing so it acted in accordance with the statute which says that “unless there is an emergency” and I will discuss that exception in a few moments if it please the Court, Mr. Evaro was clearly not in emergency case even though he needed care within the meaning of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.865" offset="860160">The county said that in accordance with the statute, it could not give him care because he had not been a resident for a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.519" offset="1962841">Certainly, that’s so provided expressly in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.284" offset="1985933">When these durational residence requirements were enacted, there was of course great concern and those, if we look back, even in the 30’s realized that this was a direct, had a penalizing effect on people who were moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.121" offset="2049254">In the 1930’s, when Congress first faced this question with respect to a public assistance benefits under the Social Security Act, it provided that durational residence requirements in that area under federally funded programs could not exceed a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.650" offset="2119367">By the time that Congress faced the question of medical care in funding State programs for medical care, the earliest being the Kerr-Mills Act in 1960, Congress expressly declared that no State program under congressional ages could be accepted if it had any durational residence requirements whatsoever for medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.407" offset="2210377">Now, let me point out that that statute doesn’t control the action of Arizona here because Arizona is not participating in those programs and the money here is not under those programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.502" offset="2250710">But we do have a square declaration by Congress that these durational requirements for medical care are not sound public policy and telling those States who do participate in federal programs that they cannot have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.132" offset="2313300">This Court first considered, of course, the question of durational residence in the welfare field, in Shapiro versus Thompson case which was decided in 1969 and the Court there held that to the extent that States may enact durational residence requirements in this field for the purpose of keeping people out, penalizing them once they got there, encouraging them to leave, that that was simply not permissible purpose for legislation and it held that absent a compelling State interest, these durational requirements cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.168" offset="2457391">Now, the Shapiro case, of course, dealt with subsistence cash welfare payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.122" offset="2485185">This is medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.847" offset="2492186">We think that if there’s any distinction between the two, it’s that there’s even less justification for having these requirements for medical care, then so happened than that cash assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.655" offset="2727393">And since this Court’s decision in Shapiro, as you can see from a little chart which we have appended to our brief in asking States what they are doing now with residence requirements in the medical field.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.716" offset="2783608">There are 45 states that are not enforcing these requirements at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.151" offset="7813329">I represent Maricopa County which is a territorial subdivision of the State of Arizona that includes the City of Phoenix and roughly half the population of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.483" offset="7886681">The county maintains a large modern hospital, approximately 500 beds and large out-patient clinic department because it has a statutory duty to provide medical care for the indigent who resides in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.964" offset="7964630">The issue before this Court which I agree with Mrs. Schroeder is simply whether or not a 12-month durational residence requirement for eligibility for medical care at county expense violates the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.172" offset="8037460">I think it’s a relatively simple issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.947" offset="8048536">It breaks down into two components.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.931" offset="8060447">One, does this residency requirement in any way penalizes the right of interstate travel and two, if so, is there a compelling State interest to be protected by imposing that penalty?</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.314" offset="12533969">I think if you examine those cases, that the only distinction which can be made between the two is that in the case of Shapiro and in the other cases like Dunn that there was either a life-threatening condition, or a an invasion of a fundamental right of citizenship such as voting or -- here there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.376" offset="12650266">The condition is not life-threatening and there is no invasion of a fundamental right of citizenship, therefore, it very closely resembles the durational residence requirement in Starns.</text>
