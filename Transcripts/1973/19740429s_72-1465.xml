            <text syncTime="8.488" offset="110655">This case is here on appeal from a Three-Judge District Court from the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.378" offset="138240">The appellees, California prison inmates, brought a class action suit challenging regulations with respect to the censorship of inmate correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.799" offset="187977">The regulation prohibited correspondence that magnified grievances, unduly complained or that expressed inflammatory views, or that otherwise contained inappropriate information.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.529" offset="254851">The censorship of personal correspondence involves incidental restrictions on the right to free speech of prison inmates and also of those who correspond with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.127" offset="309290">Censorship is justified only if the following criteria are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.595" offset="335099">It must first further one or more of the substantial governmental interests, implicated in Prison Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.063" offset="373029">These are maintenance of security and order and the rehabilitation of inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.990" offset="400718">Also, the restrictions on correspondence must be no greater than is necessary to further the legitimate governmental interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.470" offset="446589">We hold that the California regulations in question do not need that foregoing criteria and therefore, they unduly burden the right of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.845" offset="496118">The case presented several other questions with respect to prison regulations which we have addressed in our opinion filed today with a click.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.924" offset="536451">We think that the District Courtâ€™s disposition of all issues was correct and accordingly its judgment is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.057" offset="573022">Mr. Justice Douglas filed an opinion concurring in the results in which he was joined by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.579" offset="611056">Mr. Justice Marshall filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan joined and in part two of which Mr. Justice Douglas joined.</text>
