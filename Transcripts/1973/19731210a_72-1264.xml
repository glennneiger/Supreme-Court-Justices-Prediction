            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments first in 72-1264, Mayor of Philadelphia against Educational Equality League.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.611" offset="131239">Mr. Mattioni.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John Mattioni</label>
            <text syncTime="15.031" offset="136882">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.156" offset="157362">This matter arises out of an action commenced in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, wherein the respondents sue the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, then James H. J. Tate, and the members of the Educational Nominating Panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.796" offset="231967">The allegations made contended that the appointment to that panel discriminated on the basis of race and, therefore, it was requested that the appointments made by the Mayor be strict in as invalidly made under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.802" offset="299990">In order to fully understand what the case is all about, it is necessary to understand something about the Educational Home Rule Charter provisions of the City of Philadelphia and the method of selecting and appointing members of the School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.140" offset="365296">In 1965, the electors of the City of Philadelphia adopted a new home rule charter establishing a Home Rule School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.345" offset="418168">This was a result of a Commission appointed by Mayor Tate which studied the problem and nature of the school district some-years before the City of Philadelphia having obtained an almost complete home rule in all other aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.033" offset="488908">The legislature of the common law of Pennsylvania had authorized, now something new, a home rule for the School District of Philadelphia as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.121" offset="525270">A Commission was appointed and, because of various problems, came up with what essentially was experimental in nature, and also represented something of compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.842" offset="572082">The method of selecting members of the School Board, which is not an issue in this matter before the Court, was determined essentially as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.518" offset="618789">The Mayor of the City of Philadelphia would appoint 13 members of the Educational Nominating Panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.555" offset="654942">Those 13 members would in turn, for each vacancy on the Board, recommend initially three, and if the Mayor requested, an additional three persons from which the Mayor could make the appointments to the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.709" offset="723592">The 13 of the 39 were required to be appointed from certain classes of organizations within the City of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.537" offset="770926">There were supposed to be citywide in scope and representative of such groups as the labor, commercial interest intergroup relations, parent-teacher associations, public education representatives, general community organizations of citizens, organizations for the purpose of improvement of local government, higher education in the form of someone who is Head of a higher education institution in the City of Philadelphia, and a group concerned with the physical resources of the city.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="211.825" stopTime="216.540">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="211.825" offset="924003">Were these groups indicated by name or by category?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_mattioni" startTime="216.540" stopTime="259.321">
            <label>Mr. John Mattioni</label>
            <text syncTime="216.540" offset="942916">By category, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.723" offset="947618">They were not -- the charter did not specifically say group X must be the one from which appointments are made but, rather, said for example, with respect to labor organizations, a council for other organization of labor unions in the city, and it did not say that it had to be a particular one.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.146" offset="1033300">The framers of the charter, being aware and being concerned with the fact that if you specified a particular organization now, that might go out of existence in the future or it might become invalid in the sense that it although is still in existence it might shrink in size and not be citywide.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="259.321" stopTime="268.867">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="259.321" offset="1114070">Mr. Mattioni, perhaps you’ve covered this.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.036" offset="1124937">I want to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.855" offset="1128176">There’s no attack made here on the composition of the School Board itself as distinguished on the panel.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_mattioni" startTime="268.867" stopTime="1347.492">
            <label>Mr. John Mattioni</label>
            <text syncTime="268.867" offset="1152209">That’s correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.382" offset="1162240">The attack here is solely on the appointments made to the Educational Nominating Panel, not to any appointments made to the School Board of the School District of the City of Philadelphia and, furthermore, there’s no attack made on the Charter Scheme for appointments to the Board of Education nor any attack made on the validity of the nine categories and then, after those nine, there is four that are appointments in essence at large by the Mayor where he has total discretion in terms of those four.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.863" offset="1320229">Now, they say, I believe that this is essentially an experimental type concept and at least until this attack seemed to work reasonably well.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.598" offset="1371115">The harder guts of the whole procedure was that you wanted to have on this panel persons who represented, in essence, all of the various kinds of problems that a School Board and a School District would have to deal with during the course of its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.354" offset="1458155">As, for example, we all know in a-- in large urban School Districts now and indeed in many of the smaller ones, there are truculently substantial labor management relations problems and, of course, in Philadelphia where we do not escape this, in the last couple of years, we’ve been subject to rather extended and protracted labor disputes with school teachers and labor disputes with other support personnel in the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.990" offset="1568705">The School Board has to contend with economic problems of a rather major proportion and, again, the purpose of the charter was to make sure that we had represented on the Nominating Panel people who could screen applicants and not possible nominees for the School Board to insure that they met at least minimally all of the necessary requirements, and the concept was to have people on the Nominating Panel who had expertise in their particular areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.868" offset="1704229">As, for example, an organization dealing with intergroup relations, because it’s quite clear that urban School Districts have substantial race relations problems and other problems of a similar nature and I think this is borne out by the fact that the Head of the Charter Commission wrote and as quoted in respondents’ brief, “the Panel’s composition should be so-arranged in the charter that it can always constitute a balanced representation or a cross-section of the entire community, all of the community’s ethnic, racial, economic, geographic elements and segments” and the point here and the reason why I’m dwelling on this is it’s important to understand that this charter, at this charter scheme was intended to be representative in a very much broader sense than simply on the basis of Black and White.Respondents would have that the only consideration is representation on the basis of Black and White.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.615" offset="1971200">I believe this is further borne out by the fact that we’re here dealing with the fourth largest city in the United States, a city with a population of approximately 2 million people, a city which has in its populous persons from all kinds and all manner of racial and ethnic backgrounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.456" offset="2058553">For example, there are large concentrations of Italian-Americans, Russian-Americans, German-Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.266" offset="2081855">There are large concentrations of Blacks and of course Blacks, like all other people, can’t be put into a bowl and mixed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.988" offset="2112679">These are diverse people.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.528" offset="2122815">They are, if nothing else, they can be divided into two broad general categories: Blacks who were in Philadelphia for hundreds of years, who predated even the Constitution of the United States, and those who are of very recent migration from areas in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.977" offset="2192614">But in addition to that, in addition to the variations in population, Philadelphia is a large industrial city.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.105" offset="2225215">It has heavy industry, oil refineries, smelting industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.139" offset="2241306">It’s a large commercial center.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.519" offset="2250815">It has banks and brokerage houses and stock exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.352" offset="2262204">It has large commercial areas and retail sales and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.759" offset="2283833">It’s a major port facility in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.163" offset="2297417">It’s probably the third or fourth largest port in the United States in terms of tonnage and Philadelphia, perhaps more important than all of these things, is known as a residential city and, of course, it’s a city with problems, very substantial problems, but those problems are being dealt with here notwithstanding all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.661" offset="2391353">The respondents came into Court alleging that Mayor Tate was guilty of discrimination on the basis of race making his appointments to this Educational Nominating Panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.184" offset="2473482">This was proven by the plain -- by the respondents almost entirely on a strictly statistical basis but, at no time in the Court below did the respondents ever proved and that the statistics upon which they relied had any statistical significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.308" offset="2570031">Not only did they not prove statistical significance, but they never proved the practical and actual significance in an ordinary everyday sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.263" offset="2613812">What they did prove was that in 1971 Mayor Tate appointed two Blacks out of 13 members to the Nominating Panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.878" offset="2664281">That from 1965, through the appointments made by the-- in 1971, Blacks were appointed to the Nominating Panel on the basis of an average of two out of thirteen or, in percentages, approximately 15.4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.398" offset="2754351">They also attempted to prove discrimination in appointments to the Nominating Panel on the basis of alleged discrimination by Mayor Tate in his appointments to city government, and that was purported to be done by establishing from the records produced by the City of Philadelphia that of all of the persons appointed, not necessarily by the Mayor but employed by the City of Philadelphia earning $20,000 or more, that only approximately 9 or 12%, and I’m not -- the particular percentage -- at the moment, were Black as opposed to a population of 33% Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.795" offset="2931879">And that in the Boards and Commissions the Mayor appointed 12% Blacks as opposed to the same population of 33%.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.944" offset="2972526">The respondents went further than that and said that, because the population of the School District in terms of its pupils was approximately 65% Black, that this necessitated some additional consideration of race, I believe in this instance a new category never before sanctioned by any Court, reference to the school population as opposed to the city population of persons who should be considered as eligible for nomination or appointment to the Nominating Panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.006" offset="3108780">Countering this, the petitioners submitted evidence, first of all, took the position that there was no statistical significance proved and, second of all, submitted evidence that the Mayor’s appointments to various positions in city government, insofar as the relationship between Black and White was concerned, was substantially better than private industry in the same city, substantially better than national averages in the United States, substantially better than other governmental agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.698" offset="3267500">More importantly, petitioners put in evidence, which was not contradicted in any way, shape, or form, that the City of Philadelphia’s workforce is 41% Black as opposed to 33% in the population, that 24% of the middle management was Black, that somewhere between 9 and 12% of upper management was Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.089" offset="3369064">Now from this, of course, the respondents would derive some kind of discriminatory pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.621" offset="3387246">However, it was further established that under then Mayor Tate’s regime, as Chief Executive Officer of the City of Philadelphia, the pattern of employment of Blacks in all levels, in the lowest levels, in middle management, in upper management had increased substantially over the 8 or 9 or 10 years that he had been in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.302" offset="3485989">That he had continually taken pains to ensure that qualified Blacks were continuously appointed and promoted and reappointed and re-promoted as fast as could be done under the circumstances, and without infringing upon the rights of any other person or persons in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.273" offset="3573864">The only complaint in essence that respondents have is that, in their view, it wasn’t done fast enough and, because there was some alleged statistical underrepresentation of Blacks, that all of a sudden this had to prove racial discrimination on the part of Mayor Tate but, quite the contrary is true when considered in complete context.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.696" offset="3679504">Respondents went one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.830" offset="3692042">They said that they proved actual discrimination on the part of Mayor Tate in his appointment, and this goes back then to question of what that evidence was, and bearing in mind that the District Court judge who heard the evidence refused to find actual discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.471" offset="3774589">The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, found that there was evidence of actual discrimination which was not rebutted on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.571" offset="3806981">We believe that the Court of Appeals clearly violated Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because the finding or the refusal to find discrimination by the District Court judge was not clearly erroneous and was, in fact, supported by substantial evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.079" offset="3885035">The only evidence of alleged actual discrimination was a testimony of W. Wilson Good who said that in 1696, two years before the actions of which complaints now made, Mayor Tate had publicly said at the time the Mayor made a public statement that he was not going to appoint anymore Negroes to the Board because, in his feeling, they had adequate representation and that he was going to appoint someone from the Nominees to the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.576" offset="4015020">Well, I submit that that’s a rather thin ice upon which the bottom, a finding of actual discriminatory intent on the part of the Chief Executive Officer of the city of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.480" offset="4058697">Not only is that rather thin evidence, but it was clearly refuted in evidence by the person who had been instrumental in making the appointments acting as an aid to Mayor Tate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.952" offset="4116584">He specifically said that Mayor Tate was an old warhorse politician, and that he took into account all of the necessary things and his -- one of his primary criterion in making appointments was to be sure that everybody had adequate representation on these kinds of Boards or Commissions, including the Nominating Panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.146" offset="4217313">And, of course, in the final analysis, the question really comes down to, looking at the Educational Nominating Panel itself, considering what it's purpose was, considering what it was intended to do, intended to achieve and how it was intended to achieve it, a finding of discrimination whether inferentially based on statistics of which the significance was never proved or based upon the meager testimony of W. Wilson Good, which was contradicted and which was not accepted by the trial judge who heard the testimony, is grossly unfair to the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.012" offset="4380839">Indeed, it does more harm to the City of Philadelphia than good in every way, shape, and form that could be imagined or considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.848" offset="4428173">The respondents placed particular emphasis on several decisions of this Court</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.145" offset="4457326">I believe that they rely most strenuously upon Calvin Turner versus Fouche, a decision by this Honorable Court in January of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.768" offset="4515840">The difficulty, I believe, with that-- placing reliance upon that case which must, of course, be read in tandem with Carter versus Jury Commissioner of Greene County, is that, there, the issue involved: appointments to a jury panel -- grand jury panel which in turn then appointed a School Board, and the evidence showed rather clearly and dramatically that discrimination was involved in the selection of grand jurors by the Jury Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.064" offset="4653035">Now, the Jury Commissioners in that case stand essentially on a footing, on the same footing with the Educational Nominating Panel in this case and, interestingly enough, the plaintiffs in that case wanted to set aside the appointment of the Jury Commissioner, and this Court refused to set aside that appointment notwithstanding that all of the Jury Commissioners were White and notwithstanding it was proved that they were guilty of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.855" offset="4784170">In the matter before the Court now, there is not one iota of evidence to establish that the Educational Nominating Panel, the very panel which is being attacked by the respondents, acted in any way in a discriminatory manner in making its recommendations for appointment to the Mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.806" offset="4855954">There isn’t even a contention made here that the Mayor discriminated in making his appointments to the School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.150" offset="4881345">That is the Board which was charged with the responsibility of running the school system, not the Educational Nominating Panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.682" offset="4915513">It was simply an instrument to (a) the Mayor in making nominations to the School Board. Of course, the reason why no contention was made to that effect is rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.456" offset="4974550">At the present time, 33% of the School Board is Black and, at the time that this case was in suit, 24% was Black, and the School Board has never been without Black representation nor has the Educational Nominating Panel been without Black representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.868" offset="5040170">Indeed, if the criteria sought to be established by respondents were accepted by this Court, we would have an almost insurmountable problem because every recognizable ethnic minority, every recognizable minority of any kind be it Asiatic, be it Italian-American, be it Russian-American, Black-American would have the same right to proportional representation on this panel, but this is a panel of 13 members and that’s an impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.335" offset="5178096">Respondents’ witnesses testified, for example, that the Puerto Rican-Americans in the City of Philadelphia were absolutely entitled to representation on this panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.925" offset="5216444">But, the problem with that is that on a proportional basis, they couldn’t be entitled to representation because they represent less than 3% of the population of the City of Philadelphia, and one person on the Educational Nominating Panel represents 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.940" offset="5276526">So that, they don’t even have enough to say that we’re entitled to half of one person on the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.105" offset="5301185">And, if we were to accept that proposition, then no person who was Puerto Rican could ever appointed to the panel because he’s not entitled to his proportion on that panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.543" offset="5346952">No person of Chinese-American extraction in the City of Philadelphia could ever be entitled to such representation because although we have a strong and viable Chinese-American community in Philadelphia, it’s small and it’s too small to be entitled to a proportion that share on this panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.664" offset="5419363">And so under those circumstances, it would represent a gross inequity to all other minorities and, indeed, to those who might be considered as a majority, if there is one, in any urban center in the United States today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.439" offset="7562553">It’s great honor for any lawyer to appear here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.830" offset="7576033">I’m pleased that I’m here younger than my grandfather, didn’t appear here until he was 80 and my father hasn’t appeared here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.446" offset="7610514">I represent the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.697" offset="7627546">In a way, you see in me a stand in for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for it is their decision and their opinion that I am here defending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.598" offset="7667148">My clients, therefore, come before this Court not as plaintiffs, which they were below, but as parties who have -- who were found by the Court of Appeals to have proved their complaint of a violation of the fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.733" offset="7715631">I make this point at the outset because our argument today is that the issue before this Court is whether there is anything in the decision of the Court of Appeals that warrants this Court’s attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.862" offset="7756173">The essence of our argument is that there is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.710" offset="7767562">That the Court of Appeals dealt thoroughly and carefully with a unique fact situation, applied its earlier decisions and the decisions of this Court in an unexceptional manner, and neither developed nor applied a legal principle that warrants the attention of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.736" offset="7827644">The underlying facts of the case have been stated by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.913" offset="7840392">I would like to add just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.390" offset="7858260">First of all, with regard to the purpose of the panel, the defendants below introduced a substantial amount of material which purported to represent the legislative history of the composition and the establishment of the Educational Home Rule Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.860" offset="7920222">One element that they did not mention that emerges from these documents is that there was a good deal of discussion below before the enactment of the charter about the question of whether the School Board should be elected or whether it should be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.195" offset="7981558">There was substantial support for the election proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.596" offset="7995141">The compromise that resulted was this Nominating Panel and, particularly, in Exhibit D7x is a statement by the Chairman of the panel, a leading industrialist in the city, that the panel was supposed to be a counterpart of popular election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.444" offset="8066508">I think that notion is important in considering exactly what the concept of representation means.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.432" offset="8630439">I didn’t inquire into that because the issue that we’re concerned with is the exclusion of Blacks from consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.208" offset="8677564">The first element of proof that we developed was the composition of the Nominating Panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.978" offset="8704627">In 1965, there were 10 Whites and 3 Blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.656" offset="8719360">In 1967, there were 11 Whites and 2 Blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.702" offset="8735556">In 1969, there were 12 Whites and 1 Black, and in 1971, initially, there were 12 Whites and 1 Black and, subsequently, one of the Whites indicated to the Mayor that he was no longer the Chief Executive of an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.677" offset="8799504">He was replaced by a Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.385" offset="8814237">This three-two-one-two pattern, I would suggest and was found by the Court of Appeals not to be conclusive proof of racial discrimination, but was considered by the Court of Appeals to be evidence that was consistent with an inference of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.449" offset="8894589">The second thing that we proved that the District Court found as a fact and the Court of Appeals accepted as a fact was that there were Black organizations that met these standards set forth in the nine -- in eight of the nine categories in the charter document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.633" offset="8967314">We also proved and the District Court found this a fact and the Circuit Court accepted as a fact that the person who in fact put together the list of names, the Deputy Mayor, Mr. Zecca, did not know of many of these Black organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.393" offset="9022276">These are findings of fact 16 and 17 in the District Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.711" offset="9043592">We subsequently proved a pattern of underrepresentation of Blacks in other appointments by the Mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.949" offset="9076506">We did not prove discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.282" offset="9085910">We did not go into that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.563" offset="9091030">What we did prove, however, was numerical underrepresentation and I think if you look at the Appendix from page 5 to 23 and you can see in a very graphic way the -- what I would regard as a litany of exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2312.681" offset="9327491">I think that the principal issue in this case is how do you prove a case of racial discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.253" offset="9353718">Last term, in McDonnell Douglas versus Green, Mr. Justice Powell set out at some detail the order of proof and the method of proof in a case of racial discrimination, and one of the things that he said was that when you have a respondent or a defendant or an employer coming forward to say that he had valid reasons not to hire or to have taken the personnel action into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.558" offset="9466984">That you could look at other employment patterns by the same person to determine whether his defense was pre-textual is the word that Mr. Justice Powell used and, of course, this is what the lower Federal Courts have been dong ever since Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.442" offset="9546501">The question of the general employment pattern, although not determinative, is relevant as a matter of a prima facie case and it was for that reason that we introduced that evidence and, in the District Court’s opinion, some of that was the subject of a finding of fact in 17 to 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.170" offset="9641378">There was a reference to some of this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.891" offset="9656320">The Court of Appeals did not refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.292" offset="9665933">Although, on the other hand, the Court of Appeals did say that it was considering the record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.382" offset="9694250">The final evidence that we introduced was testimony by one of the plaintiffs, Wilson Good, and I think that testimony is important not only for the purpose that it was cited by Court of Appeals, but also to give this Court an idea of what was going on, what the Black community was feeling about this Educational Nominating Panel and what their response was to this particular pattern of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.844" offset="9804173">And, in that context, what happened in 1969 does become important and does reflect on 1971, and as the Court of Appeals said, it is consistent with an inference of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.217" offset="9853597">Again, it does not prove that in 1971 the Mayor discriminated but this evidence--</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.404" offset="9950354">Well, in this context, they can because the issue is not a factual inference to be drawn but a legal inference to be drawn, and the legal inference is, was there sufficient evidence in the record to establish a prima facie case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.805" offset="10015974">If there was sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case, then the burden shifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.484" offset="10034678">This also was made clear in McDonnell Douglas versus Green last term, and that is why the question of the Court of Appeals was the right question and I think that they were correct in concluding that a prima facie case of racial discrimination was made out because a prima facie case is not conclusive proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.911" offset="10116389">When I was an Assistant District Attorney in Philadelphia and trying criminal cases, a prima facie case was merely the establishment on the one side of the elements necessary to make out an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.273" offset="10169887">It was not the determination beyond a reasonable doubt or beyond any kind of doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.575" offset="10191099">It was simply the establishment on the record of elements which, if unrebutted, would be sufficient to make out a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.113" offset="10221192">That is a question of law and that is the question that the Court of Appeals addressed, and it is the question on which it reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.135" offset="10269257">Mr. Good’s testimony discussed the efforts of the Black community to convince the Mayor to appoint additional Blacks to the Nominating Panel and to the School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.826" offset="10308023">He recounted that in 1969 the efforts of the Black community had had an effect on the then existing Nominating Panel, and that the Nominating Panel had submitted two out of three in submitting three names for a vacancy that came up, submitted two Black names and he also testified that the Mayor became angry at this and made a public statement that he was not going to appoint any additional Blacks to the panel, to the School Board, and I think it’s important that this testimony is not, Mr. Justice Blackmun, based only on a newspaper article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.435" offset="10442501">The newspaper article was shown to Mr. Zecca in his cross-examination to see what his response was, but Mr. Good did not testify from the newspaper article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.350" offset="10478132">In fact, the newspaper article itself stated that it was based on statements that the Mayor made on television and, although Mr. Good did not testify to this and perhaps this was no mission of mine, he did see it on television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.337" offset="10530064">He was not cross-examined by the City Solicitor to determine whether his information was hearsay, and the record only shows that he testified that he knew that the Mayor knew made the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.310" offset="10585966">The questioning of Mr. Zecca in this regard brought forth only that Mr. Zecca did not recall the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.203" offset="10613551">That was on page 66 and again on page 93 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.312" offset="10629956">Mr. Zecca was asked “do you recall?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.972" offset="10636643">And he said “no, I don’t recall.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.469" offset="10650645">Well those, I think, are the principal facts with respect to the facts in defense that the city developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.507" offset="10690769">I think it’s important to note that Mr. Farmer who was the Chairman of the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations did testify that there were 41% Blacks in this Philadelphia City Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.065" offset="10737058">I had always assumed at trial, beginning at trial and until I received a reply brief of the city that the Mayor did have something to do with the personnel practices of the city but, according to the reply brief, apparently the Personnel Director is independent of the Mayor and, in looking at the charter, I found that that’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.470" offset="10814589">So, I’m not sure that the 41% city employment does prove anything about the Mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.506" offset="10834756">On the other hand, the testimony of Mr. Farmer showed that neither he nor anyone on his staff knew that there was a drastic reduction in Black employment in the Philadelphia Police Department which was shown in another action in Federal District Court brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania alleging employment discrimination in the Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.517" offset="10918766">That’s on page 110 of the Appendix, and Mr. Farmer, in his capacity as the Chief City Officer responsible for discrimination and employment in the city, simply didn’t know that this had occurred in the Philadelphia Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.285" offset="10977907">Well, to go back to what the Court of Appeals did, the Court of Appeals reviewed these facts and stated with regard to them that they were consistent with a finding of racial discrimination and then apply the standard developed in the jury cases of how do you prove racial discrimination, and they said the way you prove racial discrimination is, first of all, you have to find an underrepresentation of Blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.470" offset="11090651">Second of all, you find an opportunity for discrimination, and then that is enough to make out a prima facie case and, if there is n rebuttal or at least no rebuttal of any legal weight, then you conclude that the case has been made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.252" offset="11149793">Now, again, I think that what we’re always concerned with is what is the record in the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.321" offset="11178005">What is the evidence that was before the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.610" offset="11187200">Now, it may be that if Mayor Tate had testified, he could’ve satisfied everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.473" offset="11198589">He could’ve satisfied everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.822" offset="11207993">The District court, the Court of Appeals, this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.770" offset="11215830">He might have even been able to satisfy the plaintiffs in the case that he did not discriminate, but he didn’t testify and the Court of Appeals made this point in its opinion.</text>
