            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">The third case, number 72-1603, Cardwell against Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.548" offset="102922">This comes to us in the form of an application in federal habeas from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.216" offset="141584">In July 1967, almost seven years ago, the body of a man named Radcliffe was found near his car on the banks of the Olentangy River in Delaware County, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.847" offset="192157">The car had gone over the embankment and had come to rest in brush.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.233" offset="209711">Radcliffe had died from shotgun wounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.490" offset="222668">The police made casts of tire tracks at the scene and removed foreign paint scrapings from the fender of the victim’s automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.798" offset="255896">Within five days the investigation of the murder began to focus upon respondent Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.580" offset="283063">He was interviewed but nothing definitive developed from that interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.096" offset="301140">On October 10th, in response to a request, Lewis appeared at the Division of Criminal Activities in Columbus for further questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.793" offset="343876">He drove his automobile that morning to downtown Columbus and parked it in the nearby commercial public parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.193" offset="377522">Earlier the police had obtained a warrant for Lewis’ arrest, but did not seek or obtain a warrant for the search of his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.352" offset="414198">The interrogation went on most of the day and Lewis was formerly arrested in late afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.452" offset="438544">His car keys were turned over to the police and they towed the automobile from the parking lot to the police impoundment lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.484" offset="474697">The next morning, without a search warrant, examination of the outside of the car revealed that one of its operative tires matched the cast of the impression made at the scene of the crime and also revealed that paint samples taken from Lewis’ car were not different from the foreign paint on the fender of the victim’s car.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.071" offset="565081">Lewis was tried for murder in the Ohio State Court and was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.465" offset="582635">On appeal his conviction was affirmed and this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.523" offset="602802">Later Mr. Lewis sought a writ of a habeas corpus in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.775" offset="623804">The Federal District Court concluded that the seizure of the automobile in examination of its exterior violated Lewis’ rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and that the evidence obtained from the examination should have been excluded at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.602" offset="687125">The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the scraping of the paint was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, that the search was not incident to the arrest, and that the car’s seizure could not be justified on the ground that it was an instrumentality of the crime in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.057" offset="760999">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.112" offset="773224">In a plurality opinion, in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist joined, four of us conclude that the examination of the exterior of the automobile was reasonable and invaded no right of privacy that the requirement of a search warrant was meant to protect, particularly where the so-called search was made as here on the basis of probable cause and was of a movable automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.687" offset="883461">We also conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the seizure, by impounding the car, was not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.667" offset="915435">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.814" offset="932049">He is of the view that the inquiry of a Federal Court on habeas of a state prisoner’s Fourth Amendment claim should be confined solely to the question whether the defendant had an opportunity in the state courts to raise his claim and have it adjudicated fairly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.684" offset="1003520">Thus, he would reverse the judgment because Mr. Lewis does not contend that he was denied that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.672" offset="1039464">There is a dissent which will be announced.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="243.691" offset="1051481">Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Marshall and I respectfully dissent from the opinion and judgment of the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.649" offset="1107383">The most fundamental rule in this area of constitutional law is that searches and seizures conducted outside the judicial process, i.e., without a warrant issued by a judge or a magistrate are unconstitutional, subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.566" offset="1215007">Since there was no warrant authorizing the seizure or the search in this case and since none of the specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement existed on the facts of this record, we are convinced that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.826" offset="1316049">We would follow the settled constitutional law established in our previous decisions and accordingly we would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.727" offset="1355651">Our views are more fully set for out in the written dissenting opinion that I have filed today with the clerk.</text>
