            <text syncTime="12.080" offset="125074">Well, this is a tax case coming to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.928" offset="148480">We granted certiorari on the petition of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue because of an indicated conflict with decisions of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.864" offset="192157">The corporate taxpayer in 1957 issued sinking fund debentures in exchange for its then outstanding cumulative preferred shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.039" offset="236878">The issue is whether the taxpayer is entitled to claim an interest paid deduction from gross income on account of amortizable debt discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.738" offset="279719">The taxpayer would measure that discount by the difference between the face amount of the debentures and its claimed value of the preferred shares at the time of the exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.251" offset="321724">The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and was upheld in this decision by the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.285" offset="345861">The Court of Appeals, however, by divided vote reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.519" offset="362789">In an opinion filed today, we hold that the taxpayer did not incur amortizable debt discount upon the exchange of its debentures for its outstanding preferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.567" offset="406988">The reasons are set forth in the opinion at some length and accordingly the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.392" offset="438335">Mr. Justice Stewart concurs in the judgment in parts one, two and three of the opinion that has been filed.</text>
