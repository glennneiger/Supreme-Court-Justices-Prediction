            <label>Mr. Paul R. Duke</label>
            <text syncTime="42.312" offset="245969">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.169" offset="261433">This case presents a single somewhat simple issue which briefly stated is whether or not a District Court has the power to enter a net judgment in a plenary action brought by the trustees of a railroad in reorganization to collect pre-reorganization freight charges and in which action the defendant has counterclaimed for pre-reorganization loss or damage to freight when the court supervising the reorganization of the debtor railroad has not permitted to set off for any other payment of such claims for loss or damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.802" offset="443977">The record in this case is also relevantly simple and consists almost entirely of a stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.260" offset="477832">Very briefly, the Penn Central trustees whose property had entered reorganization in June of 1970, pursuant to a direction in the initial order in that reorganization to go out and collect the property of the debtor wherever they could find it, sued in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to collect some eighty-two hundred and some odd dollars in freight charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.910" offset="584411">The Defendant Gold Seal Liquors filed an answer which was essentially a general denial but also filed a counterclaim for some nineteen thousand and some dollars in loss or damage to shipments all of which occurred prior to the reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.107" offset="661211">There was thereafter a stipulation between the trustees and the Defendant Gold Seal.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.219" offset="689633">Gold Seal admitted its liability on freight charges in some sixty-nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and some odd cents and the trustees acknowledged liability on this pre-reorganization loss and damage claims in some eighteen thousand some odd dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.777" offset="759850">The trustees then moved for summary judgment and they asked the District Court to enter separate judgments in the respective amounts, one on behalf of the trustees for their $69.99 and one for Gold Seal for their $18,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.847" offset="828186">The District Court indicated that it didn’t believe that it had been cited any authority which would justify the entry of separate judgments, but concluded that in any event it would be inequitable to enter a separate judgment so it entered a single net judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.208" offset="897567">The trustees thereafter appealed to the Seventh Circuit and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.066" offset="925048">It thought the matter that was presented to it was one of judicial comity and went on to say that the matter of the adjudication of the claims in Illinois Court was a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.457" offset="978547">It said the satisfaction of the resulting judgment is subject to the equitable principles generally applicable in a court of bankruptcy and then directed that the resulting judgment be filed with the Reorganization Court for proof and allowance.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="240.875" offset="1040300">That was a net judgment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul R. Duke</label>
            <text syncTime="241.890" offset="1044271">You’re right, Your Honor, that’s the trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.731" offset="1051690">Once it said resulting judgment to say that the satisfaction of the resulting judgment is for the Reorganization Court to me begs the question because by affirming the net judgment they’d already satisfied seven-eighteenths of Gold Seal’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.817" offset="1111980">I think it can best be seen if Gold Seal had sued the trustees for $19,000.00 in pre-reorganization loss and damage claims, the trustees defended and succeeded in showing it was only $18,000.00, unlike anyone would contend that the Illinois District Court could take $7,000.00 of the trustees property which it could lay hands on in Chicago apply it in partial payment of that judgment and then they'll say as to the remainder you have to file that in Philadelphia and collect your $11,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.079" offset="1245100">We submit that that was the basic error.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.562" offset="1258998">We believe it’s probably clear that Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act confers exclusive jurisdiction of the Reorganization Court for the disposition of the property which becomes into its possession and also exclusive jurisdiction over the payment of pre-reorganization claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.817" offset="1367980">Now, admittedly they were not liquidated, at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.315" offset="1381982">We say that plenary action in the Illinois District Court liquidated those and admitted amount of some almost 24 twenty-fourth cents to $7,000.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.498" offset="2046746">But the law appears to be clear that a counterclaim for loss and damage or a claim for loss and damage, let’s not characterize what it is, is not a defense to the trustee’s action for freight charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.688" offset="3663517">Coming first to the most important point the matter of jurisdiction, there was no question that the court of bankruptcy under Section 77 (a) has exclusive jurisdiction of all of the debtor’s property at the time of the filling of the petition, but we contend that this shows an action was not such property.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.881" offset="3744287">We say there was no actual possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.443" offset="3754527">There was no constructive possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.643" offset="3763304">There was in fact to substantial adverse claim because this railroad owed this company almost two-and-a-half times the amount they claimed and it being an adverse claim, could be subject to disposition only by plenary jurisdiction, by a plenary suit which the trustees did commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.971" offset="3844598">We state further that at this time there was no jurisdiction, no summary jurisdiction at any time over Gold Seal Liquors.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.494" offset="3874691">We were outside the jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.153" offset="5197322">That order is what might be called a typical stock order if there’ll be such because it’s the usual order that has been entered in railroad reorganization cases and the paragraphs conform to the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.191" offset="5257509">The key paragraphs for this purpose would be found at page 831 paragraphs 9 and 10.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.568" offset="5295020">The first one to maintain the status quo is an injunction against interfering with a property of the debtor by garnishment, by levying, by interfering with liens and in our opinion against voluntary set offs because all of the cases urged by the trustees in the courts below concerning this question involved voluntary set offs, actions of self-help, some in aggregative circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.839" offset="5412153">In the Susquehanna case the Court noted that what had happened was that the bank by appropriating deposit balances had seized the operating cash to the railroad, equitable principles again.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.292" offset="5581949">And in Order 571, the Second Order that I would allude to entered in the summer of 1972 by Judge Fullam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.517" offset="5614864">These involved shippers doing things by themselves setting off their own claims or alleging the existence of prior contractual arrangements with a debtor which would allow them to set off unilaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.799" offset="5675990">There was no instance in that case of judicial action and I don’t think that Judge Fullam should be accused any, not that he is, but even considered to have intended that because in his Order 571 which is found at page 1 (a) of our blue covered brief, he extends his orders to all persons, firms and corporations served with a copy of the petition and we were never served, and he prohibits them from setting off or attempting to set off obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.608" offset="5799184">We humbly suggest and submit that the litigation under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a compulsory counterclaim and a plenary suit is not the type of thing that Judge Fullam was talking about in Order 571.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.407" offset="5870341">If we want to find out what Congress actually intended in the legislation, I frankly have had not too much success in looking over the reports of the committee on the judiciary shared by Representative Summers on the subcommittee on bankruptcy, headed by Mr. Walter Chandler about the time that Section 77 was amended in 1935 and subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.274" offset="5969816">We find much material on the modification of security interests, the amount of consent necessary to implement a plan, the need for railroad reorganization legislation to supplant the vices of equity receiverships, but nothing on this one question, but we do see one interesting thing, one indication of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.099" offset="6065110">We find first in Section 77 (l), sub-paragraph (l) of Section 77, the statement of the courts in reorganization of all the powers of District Courts sitting in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.017" offset="6120803">The creditor’s rights are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.829" offset="6132088">The court’s powers are the same and secondly in Section 77 (j), we find the proviso so to the effect that the courts are precluded from enjoining actions arising out of the operation of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.301" offset="6213904">This proviso was reflected on a typical order in the single appendix at page 831, lines 18 to 21 of paragraph 9, down to near the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.671" offset="6271478">The Court reflects the statutory mandate which has provided it suits or claims for damages caused by the operation of trains, etcetera may be prosecuted the judgment at state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.460" offset="6314632">And the Michigan Court recognized that to some extent although I don’t know what the value of it is, if you allow litigation of a counterclaim and you do not give effect to it in a usual manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.186" offset="6361443">There is no indication we submit in the Act of Congress of any intent to treat a counterclaim in this situation, otherwise then as a usual regular and typical counterclaim and we don’t think that the bar against the set off is a bar against litigation of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.336" offset="6450051">Now, from a policy point of view I suppose we are concerned about discrimination, discriminating against various classes of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.206" offset="6485577">But I think, Your Honors, that discrimination is the root of the judicial process because as jurists and as lawyers, we discriminate when we try to separate the relevant from the irrelevant facts in every situation and I think when we look at the situation in this particular case when we see the congressional intent in Section 77 (j), I don’t think that the result is an outrageous result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.026" offset="6612846">I think that the courts below did substantial justice in this case because we were not typical creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.000" offset="6640744">We were not customers of this railroad profiting by our business dealings with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.807" offset="6663941">We were the patrons of this railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.526" offset="6678883">My client along with many, many others made this railroad run by giving it business and the more business we gave that up to the end, the more we were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.162" offset="6725381">And I think basically that in the suit -- that the courts below did the proper thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.535" offset="6762893">I checked myself because I was concerned keeping in mind the Lowden record, the records of the courts of the principle center in the Seventh Circuit, those in Illinois, in Cook County, Illinois and I found the total of only three cases where there were counterclaims filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.070" offset="6841051">None particularly pleaded in detail, one in the state court, two in the federal court of which one is being removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.990" offset="6868741">There is no plethora of cases that would cause a problem to these trustees in the administration of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.040" offset="6896953">It isn’t the existence of cases like this involving a little company that have brought the railroad to the past that it is right now where it may not even be reorganizable, but I think as a matter of law that the decisions are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.128" offset="6957244">I think that the decisions of prior to courts sustain our position and a reading of the orders themselves would indicate that they were not intended to have the fact urged by counsel in that.</text>
