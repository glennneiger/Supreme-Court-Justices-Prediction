            <text syncTime="36.212" offset="221623">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.896" offset="232281">I am Dick League from Raleigh, North Carolina to argue this case for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.989" offset="252656">Before I begin an argument, I?d like to apologize having each of you for the shabby condition, I understand the briefs and records that came up before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.405" offset="282331">I hope you accept my apologies in that regard and that it won?t let you change your view of the case too bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.966" offset="320575">This case presents two issues to the Court for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.476" offset="334681">First, whether or not double jeopardy is a matter that would be waived by a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty and, secondly, if the record in this case is good enough to show that such plea was made here once voluntarily and intelligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.555" offset="394971">The facts on which this arises are as briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.421" offset="418482">Jimmy Seth Perry was tried in the lower level of our two-tier system in North Carolina, the District Court, on a warrant charging him with misdemeanor assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.172" offset="461427">After conviction there and sentenced to a consecutive six months sentence, he appealed to the Superior Court division, the higher division of the two-tier system in which there is a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.478" offset="502700">He appealed for trial de novo as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.230" offset="517642">Prior to the case coming on to be called later, the Solicitor obtained an indictment charging him with a higher grade of the offense, felony assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.628" offset="567275">And to this, he pled and received a sentence in the Superior Court of some five to seven years, however, this sentence was consecutive to the sentence he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.597" offset="603115">At the time he made the plea and, accordingly, the actual extension of time beyond the six months consecutive sentence he received below something like about three-and-a half months at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.708" offset="659540">Subsequently, in this proceeding in the Eastern District, he obtained habeas corpus relief on the issue of pretrial credit --</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard N. League</label>
            <text syncTime="157.914" offset="708441">I?m definitely sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.333" offset="718054">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.678" offset="727458">I tend to say and point in the facts as I had just mentioned, Your Honor, was that the five to seven-year sentence concurrent with the sentence he was then serving operated to giving him about a three-and-a half month increase over the six-month consecutive sentence he?d received in District Court, until the time of this action when he received pretrial credit on the first penalty which created a greater disparity between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.335" offset="858070">In my position, briefly, on the first issue is that double jeopardy is a matter which would be waived as an independent basis of collateral attack by virtue of his guilty plea in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.343" offset="910106">And he can only use that in a habeas corpus action as evidence of some other basis for relief such as, in effect, of the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.128" offset="965277">Mr. Keenan has suggested to you that you ought to adopt a system-related, guilt-related distinction with regard to determining whether or not such waiver has been made in any given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.222" offset="1017626">But I argue that you should not accept that, and it?s not always clear just what is guilt and what is system-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.938" offset="1048451">In fact, part of the rationale, as I understand it, of the double jeopardy clause is to prevent punishment, the conviction of the innocent through repeated prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.961" offset="1100591">It?s according that, I think, this right would definitely partake both being a system-related right and a right which is guilt-related as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.940" offset="1208529">So, in that sense, I would view it as possibly guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.335" offset="4598073">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.994" offset="4608731">I appear on behalf of respondent, Jimmy Seth Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.279" offset="4625868">With the Court?s permission, I would like to run briefly back over the facts because though they are a little bizarre, I nevertheless think that what happened to this case was rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.571" offset="4663066">On August 1, 1969, Jimmy Perry was serving a five to seven-year sentence in the North Carolina Department of Corrections for uttering a forged instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.037" offset="4700891">On that day, a fellow inmate, by the name of Eugene Sawyer received a 14-inch cut in his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.322" offset="4726073">An investigation sued by the authorities of the Autumn Fire Unit in Northampton County, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.873" offset="4756271">And on the 18th day of August 1969, a warrant was sworn out by a prison guard charging Jimmy Seth Perry with the misdemeanor of assault with a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.293" offset="4797962">On August 20, 1969, Mr. Perry was brought to court in the Northampton County District Court which is the proper court in North Carolina for the trial of misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.564" offset="4846968">All misdemeanors must be tried in the first instance at the District Court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.859" offset="4864209">On that date, the Solicitor or the District Attorney who was trying the case, after conferring with the officer, felt that the conduct necessitated a charge of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.726" offset="4911647">Therefore, he made a motion in open court to amend the warrant to charge the felony of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill resulting to serious bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.903" offset="4952398">Under North Carolina law, they would then proceed to hold a preliminary hearing in District Court but not in trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.222" offset="4981656">However, later that same day, the Solicitor learnt that he victim, Mr. Sawyer, would refuse to testify against Mr. Perry and, in fact, was claiming totally lack of recall as to what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.646" offset="5027318">Therefore, he had a very practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.414" offset="5038393">He did have a statement that Mr. Perry had made to the officer who had sworn out the warrant that, yes, he had cut him but it had been an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.571" offset="5070994">Therefore, the Solicitor made that the deliberate choice to move again to re-amend the warrant to charge misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.305" offset="6293943">The state, in his answer, admitted these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.760" offset="6303765">So, there was no evidentiary hearing conducted in the District Court on these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.377" offset="6326230">We contend, well, just to finish up briefly, after the matter had been brought over to the grand jury, he was indicted for the 10-year felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.690" offset="6383491">And at that time, a plea of guilty was entered as charged to the 10-year felony, and he was given a five to seven-year sentence concurrent with the sentence being served at that time which, as the District Court found, effectively raised his sentence by one year, five months and one day over the sentence received in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.188" offset="6453499">Now our basic contention is, first, that the act of the state, in proceeding to charge Perry in attempt to try him with a felony in the Superior Court, denied Perry double jeopardy and that, therefore, there was -- there is an independent constitutional violation to be showed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.225" offset="9541695">This is in effect, taking as granted the validity of the double jeopardy argument of which the whole argument is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.577" offset="9571056">The first argument is in that each of those prior cases there was a legitimate state interest in punishing the person for the crime to which the guilty plea was entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2406.529" offset="9702818">They lost that right when they made a determination to proceed with a misdemeanor in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.438" offset="11330456">The state does have an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.625" offset="11339233">But the question of whether or not the guilty plea surrenders or forfeits the double jeopardy claim, we think, in the question of double jeopardy which we do see as an absolute bar to re-trial brings about fact that the state must, in fact, show that the person consciously made a decision to surrender the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.989" offset="11432751">The second conceivable situation would be where a person deliberately bypassed state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.026" offset="11456888">Again, this would be a very, very rare case because why would a defendant forfeit a possible state remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.264" offset="11489802">The other question that was brief related to what Boykin requires that a defendant be warned of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.973" offset="11516656">If the rule is to be a flat rule that one who pleads guilty surrenders any prior constitutional right with no qualifications whatsoever, we would contend that the defendant ought to be told that at the time he pleads guilty so that here could be no question in his mind that this is not a matter that?s going to be resolved through later writs or through later court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.008" offset="11604741">In this particular instance the judge did run through a series formal of questions, which are in the record, with the defendant and which indicated that he was warned that he could receive a certain maximum sentence, and that he did have a right to trial by jury, and that he did have a right to be represented by counsel and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.343" offset="11678093">However, there is nothing in the record that indicates and in effect of what?s been asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.785" offset="11695856">There?s nothing that indicates that Mr. Perry was informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.941" offset="11708500">If you plead guilty here, don?t ever come back to court in any constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.696" offset="11727517">And we contend that if that is to be the rule, then the defendant should be told precisely that.</text>
