            <text syncTime="16.460" offset="142629">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.422" offset="154436">My name is Brooks Patterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.514" offset="158824">I am the prosecuting attorney of Oakland County in Michigan, representing the people of the State of Michigan in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.654" offset="183380">Before stating the facts, there are four dates that I would like to stress because they have a bearing on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.142" offset="213368">Now, logically they are the date of the Escobedo decision in June of 1964; Secondly, the date of the offense in this particular case, April 19, 1966; Third, the date of the Miranda decision, June 13, 1966; And finally, the date of the commencement of trial of the Tucker case, October 18, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.933" offset="320470">The facts of the case: On April 19, 1966, it is undisputed that Marline Cory (ph) was brutally beaten and raped in her home in which she lived by herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.088" offset="369058">She was beaten so badly that she was never able to remember nor did she recall the time that she testified and make any identification of the defendant as her assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.719" offset="407615">She was discovered in her home by a co-worker who summoned the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.389" offset="426318">This co-worker also noticed inside her home a dog and since Miss Cory did not own a pet, he brought this to the attention of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.981" offset="460696">The police followed this dog to the residence of the defendant, Thomas Wayne Tucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.760" offset="483788">After making inquiries with the neighbors about the ownership of that particular dog, the police put out a broadcast to pick up the defendant and later that day, he was arrested and brought to the Police Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.347" offset="534152">Before any interrogation of the defendant, he was advised of his rights as delineated at that time by the Escobedo decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.428" offset="566439">Specifically, he was advised of his right to remain silent, that anything he said would be used against him at the Court of Law, and that he had the right to an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.188" offset="605518">It was not advised, however, that he had a right to a Court appointed attorney, but that right was yet to be mandated in the Miranda decision two months hence.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.298" offset="645956">During the interrogation that followed, the defendant said that he had obtained the --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="146.324" offset="662047">Was he told -- was he told that he had a right to have a lawyer then and there?</text>

            <label>Mr. L. Brooks Patterson</label>
            <text syncTime="150.355" offset="678139">No, he had a right to an attorney but not at -- in no specific words then and there.</text>

            <label>Mr. L. Brooks Patterson</label>
            <text syncTime="155.603" offset="699141">During the interrogation that followed, the defendant told the police that he had obtained the noticeable scratches on his face from the flarings of a goose that he had killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.347" offset="738116">And this would also account for the blood on his clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.978" offset="752640">He said that all of these could be confirmed by one Robert Henderson, who he was with at the time of the alleged rape and thereby creating an alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.724" offset="787644">Later the next day, in an effort to confirm that alibi, the police sought out and talked to one Robert Henderson, who not only failed to corroborate the story told by the defendant Tucker, but actually gave testimony or a statement that refuted Tucker’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.724" offset="851696">Henderson indicated to the police that indeed he did have a conversation with the defendant on April 19, 1966 and that he had asked the defendant how it came that he had these scratches on his face and whether he had gotten hold of a wild one or something, to which the defendant Tucker replied something like that, and then moments later added, “she was the widowed woman in her thirties who lived the next block over.”</text>
            <text syncTime="218.361" offset="950230">The case went to trial several months later on October 18, 1966.</text>

            <label>Mr. L. Brooks Patterson</label>
            <text syncTime="224.340" offset="974158">This was a sheriff’s department case in Pontiac Township, just outside the city of Pontiac.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.103" offset="997146">On October 18th, it went to trial and because of the intervening decision of Miranda, none of the statements made by defendant Tucker were introduced into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.302" offset="1033927">However, Henderson was called as a prosecution witness and did testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.825" offset="1056078">The defendant was convicted by a jury trial and sentenced to a prison term of 20-40 years in view of his record.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.611" offset="1079171">Both the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed that conviction with unanimous opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.517" offset="1106860">Upon application by the defendant to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for a writ of habeas corpus, the petition was granted under the theory that Henderson’s testimony had been improperly admitted into evidence by the Trial Court because of the Trial Court's failure to apply the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.261" offset="1185750">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that opinion and we petitioned for a writ of certiorari which was granted by this Court on December 3, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.132" offset="1225247">We raise three issues this morning in our argument and first is the question of the retroactivity of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.112" offset="1257221">One week after the Miranda case was decided, this Court held in Johnson versus New Jersey that Miranda would be applicable to all those trials that commenced after the decision date in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.284" offset="1305913">I think you can see from that dates that I had set out when I first commenced, that we were caught in a limbo situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.623" offset="1331200">We had an interrogation under Escobedo on April 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.131" offset="1349277">Miranda came down in June and we commenced trial in October and even though Johnson said for the proposition that Miranda would be prospective in its application, we were experiencing retroactive effect because we were caught in this limbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.063" offset="1409045">And this is the particular injustice in this case that we complain about this morning, that at the time the police were interrogating the defendant, Tucker, he was properly advised of his Escobedo rights and the police at that time were doing nothing wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.223" offset="1465678">And now by operation of the Johnson case and its retroactive effect, we are being told that the interrogation is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.764" offset="1503817">We feel that the Court should modify this retroactive application of Johnson because it places the -- this Court in the position, and the local court in the position of saying that, Tucker’s interrogation was improper, but it only became improper by operation of an ex post facto type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.571" offset="1579050">We feel that to make Johnson or the effect of Johnson to conform to its rationale and make it prospective would be in order.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.616" offset="1727216">Because it itself dealt with the retroactivity of Miranda and to say that the decision dealing with retroactivity should be accorded on a prospective effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.115" offset="1965244">Your Honor, the second issue is the doctrine that you just mentioned would be the application of the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.645" offset="1991367">And more specifically, we raise the question, whether the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree doctrine should be applied to the testimony on the identity of a witness, who was discovered during what is now declared to be an improper interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.037" offset="2040895">The Solicitor General has intervened on this particular issue and will be arguing as well on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.485" offset="2058658">So, I’d like to highlight some of the more salient points of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.513" offset="2074749">This precise question of witness testimony being suppressed under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree doctrine as yet to be presented to this Court and I take that lead from the footnote in Harrison versus United States, 392 US in Footnote 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.601" offset="2135144">It would be, to apply the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree doctrine to a witness who testifies, I think it would be unwarranted extension of that particular doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.120" offset="2169208">It would be unwarranted because the immediate distinction is that in this type of situation with Henderson, we have the testimony of a live witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.508" offset="2202749">And I do not feel that we should automatically equate a live witness and all of that and suggest the fact that he has own, a memory, and his own perception and his own will and his own intellect which are all going to interact down there when personally he takes his stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.346" offset="2262100">We should not equate that type of a human being with physical evidence automatically because we have at least that distinguishing characteristics which makes a human being unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.415" offset="2306403">Arguably is the fact that this witness when he comes into Court and takes the stand, he’s going to be subject to the rigors of cross examination by defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.164" offset="2337437">He is subject to impeachment and all the other devices that defense counsel has to cross examine and that this was done in the case of Henderson when he took the stand before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.221" offset="2385607">And that he -- a witness has the ability to have come forward on his own possibly as contrary to physical evidence, but I think more importantly is the fact that when Henderson’s name was brought up by the defendant Tucker, at that point, the name Henderson was at no evidentiary value as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.877" offset="2468258">It is not evidence the mere mentioning of a name.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.498" offset="2478707">It is not evidence per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.141" offset="2485290">By the independent labors of the police who sought him out and talked to him, at that point, he begins to become significance and when he comes in the Court and testifies, he then becomes evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.825" offset="2524056">And I believe this Court, addressed this particular problem in a case one week after Miranda which would be June 20, 1966 in Schmerber.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.657" offset="2559373">In the case -- in the language in Schmerber said that, “the privilege against self-incrimination is abide to compelling one to be a witness to give testimony,” but the Court went on to say but it is not a bar against that compulsion which makes the witness or the defendant or the accused the source of real or physical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.661" offset="2635442">And in this case, Tucker was the source we admit of Henderson’s identity, but it is not evidence the mere mentioning of that name.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.231" offset="2673685">The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine rather than being extended should be curtailed and I think is being curtailed in decisions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.047" offset="2708898">And I would say to Court, couple of the prime examples would be the case of Harris versus New York in 1970 when the Court permitted the prosecution to use for impeachment at the prior statement of the defendant which it was not being permitted to use in itscase, case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.518" offset="2770860">Even though, I think there would be the illegal fruit, it was still being -- the prosecutor was is being allowed some use of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.201" offset="2797505">In U.S versus Calandra evidence which was illegally obtained during an illegal search and seizure was still being permitted to be brought before a grand jury for the use of that grand jury in its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.164" offset="2841391">The Court -- this Court has developed as well as some of the lower Federal District Courts, I think theories which are now doctrines of law which permit or avoid the harsh application of the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine; such theories as attenuation or the independent source.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.909" offset="2916415">These rules are being carved out judicially from the announced doctrine in order to avoid the extreme and I think harsh application of the automatic exclusion of evidence by the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.907" offset="2960405">But in the case that we have, in the case of Michigan versus Tucker, to apply the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine and the purpose of that application of that doctrine is to deter unlawful police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.695" offset="3015576">In this particular instance, it would be itself unreasonable and unfair because the police first of all would not have engaged in any misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.496" offset="3046713">The interrogation of Tucker met the standards then in force under Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.223" offset="3065626">And secondly, when they went out to talk to Henderson, this witness, they were following what was the alibi of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.539" offset="3094883">The defendant had given a exculpatory remark and the police went out to check that alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.224" offset="3113691">And how they checked out, it would have been a good probable belief that Tucker would have released had his alibi been confirmed and if the police had ignored that exculpatory remark, they would have been developed that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.108" offset="3173146">The final issue that we have raised in our brief was the question of Miranda itself and we pose --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="781.517" offset="3202821">Mr. Patterson, that point that you’ve made, suppose the police had found that Henderson would exculpate the defendant here and they had not produced him as a witness, it'd be in violation of Brady and other cases, would they not?</text>

            <label>Mr. L. Brooks Patterson</label>
            <text syncTime="801.264" offset="3281816">Absolutely, Your Honor and it would be very unfair and obviously unethical thing for the prosecution or the police to have even consider to hide the witness which would have been a benefit to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.221" offset="3337613">And this is again, we are now telling them, you’ve done something improper when actually what they were doing was being proper and very ethical.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.017" offset="3372826">The question we raised with regard to Miranda, was whether the standards which were enunciated in Miranda, whether they are too restrictive and they are exclusion of admissions and whether they are mandated by the US Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.333" offset="3422041">Although, majority writing in Miranda I think answer the second half of that question, when they said that we do not consider or we cannot say that the Constitution necessarily requires adherence to any particular solution for the inherent compulsion of the interrogation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.850" offset="3492153">And those words, I think they admitted that the Constitution did not require the standards that they developed, but this was a judicially developed framework to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.887" offset="3536248">The other half of the question are the standards set forth in Miranda too restrictive and I think at this point it's undebatable that the standards which were enunciated in Miranda tolerate no deviance and the way the phrases were couched, they were couched with the use of the word “Must.”</text>
            <text syncTime="882.194" offset="3605525">These warnings MUST be given, waivers MUST be obtained and if there is any indication he does not want proceed, you MUST end your interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.420" offset="3642410">So, what the Court did in this instance whereas to develop an absolute and flexible and rigid test and the Court took what used to be a circumstances the Court would look to, the advising of certain constitutional rights, it elevated these in the form of standards what are now almost fundamental constitutional rights, the violation of which results in the automatic exclusion of a statement made by the defendant regardless of that statement might in fact be voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.109" offset="3757140">The Supreme Court way back in 1883 in Hopp versus Utah I think it said that the dealing with the question of confessions that we have wisely fore born to mark with absolute precision the limits of admission and exclusion, and I think they fore saw the problem when you do mark with a rigid test what is going to be admissible and what isn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.686" offset="3847523">What now happens in the Trial Court and I’m sure this Court is aware of it, the focus is shifted from the will of the accused or what is on his mind or why he made a statement and the first focus is now on to the conduct of the police officer and we’d look to see what he did or how he acted in order to determine if this man made a voluntary statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.840" offset="3936131">Well, actually the test that police officer goes through, the advisement of those four rights in the obtaining of a waiver is not really bearing upon the question, is this a voluntary confession and the police officers scrutiny, if he makes one fatal mistake in the advising of the rights and later when he testifies in Court, at the Trial Court in a hearing like Jackson v. Denno, we call walker hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.366" offset="4026201">If he testifies in his hearing about voluntariness and makes one mistake and how he said he gave his rights, the Court stops, at that point, it is inquiry as to the voluntariness of a confession and because the Miranda standards had been violated, maybe one had been omitted or had been incorrectly testified to, the inquiry stops and because of that deviation from the standard set forth, the Court, Trial Court will exclude any statement made by the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.604" offset="4135184">The test is no longer now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.811" offset="4148036">And Miranda, I believe was supposed to take us away from looking at the totality of circumstances and we are supposed to look into this condition precedent before we get to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.859" offset="4188160">There is now a condition preceding namely the four rights the officer makes and Miranda was supposed to take us away from examining the totality of circumstances and make a very simple to determine if indeed a voluntary statement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.641" offset="4239360">And the old test of looking to the defendant to see if his will was over borne or if there was any inducement or coercion upon him or any threats to make him, make a statement or obtain a weaver, were supposed to have been taken out of the examination of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.019" offset="4296829">But in fact, I think that they we’re fooling ourselves if we don’t realize that we are still in the Trial Court and very much immersed in a total circumstances examination, a totality of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.816" offset="4355971">We still look to all these factors and in determining whether the rights were properly administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.508" offset="4374779">We still, the Court will still look to the totality of circumstances to see how the rights were administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.973" offset="4396617">Were they administered after three days of incommunicado interrogation or were they --</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.982" offset="4424725">And so, even though the warnings are there and a condition preceding to get into the level of examining the voluntaries, the Court still brings in all these circumstance of how that officer gave his rights, when did he give the defendant his rights, under what circumstances were the rights administered and was he intoxicated and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.282" offset="4489927">I think Mr. Justice White in his dissent foresaw some of these problems when he wrote, “today’s decision leaves open such questions as whether the accused was in custody, whether his statements were spontaneous or the product of interrogation, whether the accused has effectively waived his rights and whether non-testimony of the evidence introduced at trail is the fruit of statements made during a prohibited interrogation” and Mr. Justice White was absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.196" offset="4593580">We now have these mini trials and the prosecution must prevail in everyone of this questions and more and should we feel on just one of these questions, even though we might prevail on six, if we miss on one of these mini trials, at that point the inquiry ends and the judge automatically excludes the statement that was obtained as a fruit or as a illegal confession.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward R. Korman</label>
            <text syncTime="1471.301" offset="5961979">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.371" offset="5978279">We are not here asking that Miranda v. Arizona be overruled nor that Johnson versus New Jersey be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.517" offset="6010776">Rather the issue was whether the holding in Miranda versus Arizona should be extended to interrogation which elicits statements not admitted into evidence against the accused, but merely lead to the discovery of other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.848" offset="6068140">The arguments of the party is focused principally on whether the so-called Fruit of the Poison Tree doctrine extends to the testimony of a live witness whose identity was discovered as a result of interrogation without the Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.283" offset="6125923">The critical assumption upon which this argument is based of course, is that there was in fact the poison tree, that it was clearly a violation of the self-incrimination clause to engage in informal custodial interrogation to obtain statements which were not admitted against the accused at trial but merely led to the discovery of other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.344" offset="6222158">While we agree with the State of Michigan, that if in fact the tree here was poisoned, the fruit should not be suppressed, it is our submission that this case presents two analytically distinct issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.731" offset="6275657">The threshold issue involves the scope of the protection that the self-incrimination clause affords to a subject in the context of informal custodial interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.707" offset="6323618">In Miranda, it was held that during such informal interrogation an accused may not be compelled to make any statements which could be admitted against him at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.628" offset="6363220">That custodial interrogation even without the use of tactics which would render the statement involuntary was inherently coercive and that warnings were necessary to ensure that the privilege against self-incrimination was not violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.552" offset="6422988">We believe that in the peculiar context of informal interrogation, this protection is adequate to vindicate those bundle of values reflected by the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.546" offset="6470949">And that where law enforcement officers elicit statements during such custodial interrogation which are merely used to discover evidence to prove which against self-incrimination has not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.019" offset="6524865">We do not regard this claim as having been foreclosed by Councilman against Hitchcock, where it was held that a witness subpoenaed before a grand jury could not be compelled under a threat of contempt to answer questions where the only use which could be made of the statements was to discover other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.260" offset="6601770">First, the defendant in this case did not refuse to answer any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.991" offset="6620682">Nor did he assert his privilege nor is there is a matter of a fact as opposed to presumption any basis for the assertion that his statement was compelled in violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.438" offset="6682540">More significantly, in light of the values reflected by the self-incrimination clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.816" offset="6703961">There is a substantial basis for distinguishing first between compelled testimony before grand jury, a congressional proceeding or similar inquiry, an informal custodial interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.588" offset="6755056">And second, distinguishing between interrogation which leads to the admission of statements made by the accused at this trial and the use of those statements to obtain other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.181" offset="6801450">Those values were complete -- the values reflected by the privilege against self-incrimination, a clause that was comprehensibly set forth by Mr. Justice Goldberg in his opinion for the Court and Murphy against the Waterfront Commission and the relevant excerpt from that opinion as set forth at page 15 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.276" offset="6877832">Unlike grand jury witnesses, the defendant here was not subject to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.656" offset="6915344">Moreover, he was not subject to inhumane treatment nor given the circumstances which led to his arrest can it reasonably be said that his custodial interrogation improperly infringed on the privacy values which are reflected by the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.631" offset="6987233">And here again, such interrogation is substantially different from that before a grand jury or congressional committee where a witness can be compelled to appear without the slightest probable clause to believe that he has any information to give to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.187" offset="7053479">Moreover, they need be no concern here that the interrogation will lead to the admission of trial of self-deprecatory statements of questionable validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.387" offset="7098305">That concern was important to the Court’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.470" offset="7110635">It was specifically eluded to twice in the majority opinion in Miranda and also in the discussion of the purpose of the Miranda warnings which appears in Johnson versus New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.580" offset="7155043">We do not deny that such interrogation which is intended to obtain leads to other evidence does implicate by policies reflected by the privilege that is that the Government and its context would be individual should shoulder the entire load and to a limited extent the preference for an accusatorial rather than inquisitorial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.629" offset="7239262">But, we submit that it does not violate those values anymore than has already been sanctioned by this Court in cases such as Schmerber versus California, United States versus Dionisio and Maier and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.642" offset="7299344">If for example, an individual maybe compelled to speak and when I use the word compelled, I mean under the threat of jail, so that a witness maybe able to testify at trial, that his voice was that for example of a kidnapper who telephoned to ask for a ransom, why may not that individual if he is apprehended before his accomplices have released the victim be interrogated without any such over compulsion regarding the location of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.582" offset="7415118">And, if the victim is found alive, why should not her testimony identifying the suspects so interrogated not be admitted or his fingerprints are found at the location where this victim has been found, why should the be suppressed, yet this is the import of the holding of a Court’s below.</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.011" offset="9052787">In many ways the argument we make, although it somewhat appear, maybe somewhat broader one than the state of Michigan in the sense that our -- the analysis that we suggest would apply to all fruits in this kind of a case without distinction between tangible evidence and live witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.459" offset="9126557">It would only apply in a Miranda type situation and that it would not necessarily have to extend to where in fact there was a violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.840" offset="9168144">On the other hand, the live witness will based as it is on the notions of attenuation or notions that relate to that, that we can never know for certain that this witness sort of not come forward to testified but for the violation would of course apply across the board to all cases and to all exclusionary rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.616" offset="9255184">And being the cases in the District of Columbia, if I recall correctly, we are not Miranda type situations but the Fourth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.853" offset="9300114">There are several points that I would like to touch upon as to why even if there is a -- even if we are wrong on our initial argument, even if the Fifth Amendment does protect against compulsion during the course of custodial interrogation relating to both the statements and the fruits why that exclusionary rule of Miranda should not be extended to fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.237" offset="9413695">First, we know that most of the empirical evidence that’s available and that's cited in the briefs for the respondent indicates that Miranda has very little effect on the decision of a defendant on whether to make a statement or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.336" offset="10322129">However, petitioner suggests, no circumstances which distinguished Wong Sun from the case at bar and then pointed that applying this Court’s traditional deterrent's impact approach to exclusionary rule cases requires application of the same result in Wong Sun to facts of the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.050" offset="10412931">And if I am might, I would like to go into detail regarding the circumstances, regarding the proposed test which you authored Mr. Chief Justice in Smith and Bowden case and which I submit may not be squared with the exclusionary principles enunciated by this Court in Wong Sun and previously in Nardone and Silverthorne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.340" offset="10514077">The proposed distinction would have the admissibility of the testimony of a witness turned not on the relationship between the primary police illegality and the discovery of the witness' existence and identity but rather on the voluntariness of the witness' decision to appear in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.357" offset="10590145">The test further distinguishes physical from verbal evidence on the grounds that there is no guarantee that a witness' testimony will favor the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.842" offset="10632150">That a witness is subject to cross examination and that physical evidence speaks for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.732" offset="10659631">A further condition which has been articulated in this test is that the admissibility of the testimony of the witness goes to weight but not the admissibility of that test -- of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.588" offset="10723056">The voluntariness of the a witness' decision to testify is not an appropriate consideration for the reason that it goes not to the relationship between the primary illegality and the discovery of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.872" offset="10784287">And since the focus that this Court has consistently applied in administering the exclusionary rules is the impact of deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.858" offset="10824202">This focus would be ignored by such a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.822" offset="10840085">Moreover, voluntariness of a witness' decision to testify is not appropriate consideration because a witness maybe compelled to come into Court and testify by the subpoena powers of the Court and if the witness refuses to testify, the witness is subject to a threat of contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.800" offset="14367974">There are maybe a partial exclusion, involves such as is involved in the Wade and Gilbert situation where if there is an independence source for identifying a defendant apart from an illegal lineup, the witness may still come in to Court, testify as the identity of the defendant on the basis of a previous observation, but not on the basis of the observation of the lineup.</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.887" offset="14540278">The test which was -- which is proposed by petitioner, I submit for the reasons I have stated is inconsistent with the deterrent principles of the exclusionary rule as previously fashioned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.759" offset="14607778">But I believe that the test should be rejected for reasons beyond that because in those Courts which have attempted to apply the test, it is proven to be a workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.930" offset="14652500">To begin with, the test attempts to derive definite conclusions from the acts which are ambiguous, qualitatively more so than many others which the law permits, definite conclusions to be drawn from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.184" offset="14709447">And think, this is demonstrated in the experience of courts which have attempted to imply to apply the Smith and Bowden test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.341" offset="14746122">None has articulated any consistence standards towards application and in point of fact while Smith and Bowden and Edwards, the witness' initial reluctance which was later overcome was viewed as attenuating factor which justified admissibility of the witness testimony in the taint case the same factual context was viewed is exploitation of taint requiring suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.839" offset="14856150">In the original preceding this case in the Michigan Court of Appeals, the same result that was reached in Smith and Bowden was reached on the basis of the exact opposite reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.852" offset="14896170">The Court presuming without any foundation in the record, I might add, that Henderson’s testimony was probably voluntary, therefore there was no exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.976" offset="14936607">Therefore the witness testimony should be admissible and in Smith and Anderson, the witness' initial reluctance, I am sorry the witness' initial willingness was viewed as insufficient to break the clausal chain -- to taint a chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.895" offset="15000346">There is no policy considerations which permit the Court to distinguish among these contradictory applications because of the fact none of them go to the traditional test of deterrence which this Court is applied that is the relationship between the illegality and the discovery of the evidence sought to be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.100" offset="15085192">And ultimately this test by focusing on the voluntariness of the witness' decision to testify, would have the administration of important constitutional principles depend on the emotions of the witness and his feelings towards the defendant, the victim, the courts and the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="4322.433" offset="17366518">What this Court found in Miranda, I submit is that application of the old due process test had shown itself to be so incapable of protecting the privilege that the integrity of the trial process was in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.454" offset="17450527">And that without a strict rule requiring the police to inform a suspect of all of those rights which are most critical at that time and reminding the police of restraints the law imposes upon them, that a trial was in danger of becoming that might appeal from the interrogation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.908" offset="17560346">These facts were so deeply to the part of our legal system that the decision in Johnson, applying Miranda partially retroactively is certainly not out of line with the prior -- with other decisions of this Court involving retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.659" offset="17643416">Today -- the police today are familiar with the Miranda decision and they are fully incorporated into their day-to-day workings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.823" offset="17668075">And Mr. Gribbs my co-counsel, representing Detroit Bar Association will address himself to that to a point in addition to my remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.477" offset="17714678">Miranda has had a beneficial impact on law enforcement in toto and that it provides the police with a clear standard for determining what their own limits are and what they may or may not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.331" offset="17782073">And it also has provided the courts with an objective standard against which to measure any claims of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.582" offset="17815092">And as to the waiver question, Mr. Justice Stewart asked a question this morning as to any Michigan cases on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.773" offset="17843827">There’s a recent case in Michigan Court of Appeals case, People v. McClendon, the citation which escapes me but in that case the defendant had been given the applicable Miranda warnings had refused to sign a waiver and had made a statement, and the Trial Court that held that there was a valid waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.888" offset="17916343">The Michigan Court of Appeals vacated that -- the conviction and remanded it for hearing saying that the evidence was insufficient on those facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4660.100" offset="18717153">As my brother counsel has indicated, I’m here on behalf of the Detroit Bar Association that has filed an amicus brief in connection with issue number two as it is presented by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.294" offset="18765949">The briefs speaks to that issue and I will limit my remarks to that issue and make it fairly brief. I would like to speak toward the rationale of the Miranda decision ever so briefly and then the practical results in the last seven-and-a-half, eight years in connection with Miranda and all of its implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.259" offset="18849750">Before I do, let me simply remind this Court that it asserts that the Court stepped backwards into history insofar as the practices and procedures required under Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.517" offset="18906802">Petitioner alleges that Miranda was too restrictive and thus urge to this Court to allow the test to go back to the totality of circumstances test that had been operative before Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.824" offset="18956016">Let me remind the Court that the Miranda warnings were not all new in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.725" offset="18983602">One was added; the warning as to statement that is not to be used against an individual -- the fact that it need not make a statement was practiced before Miranda, the fact that it did and it was used, it was practiced before Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.845" offset="19040131">Escobedo established a practice of an attorney and finally Miranda said, “If you can’t afford it, the Court will appoint you an attorney.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.311" offset="19066044">So, that four-fold statement and of course the requirements as to waiver as was set forth, were clearly set forth would settle that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4761.432" offset="19122469">The appointed Attorney, although that’s not quite as clear, assuming Escobedo required the fact that you can have an Attorney present and if so construed and then the Miranda warning was really the fourth one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.547" offset="19174922">The rationale, may it please the Court, I’m sure it’s very well-known to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.174" offset="19205433">Let me simply point out that what Miranda protects goes to the very roots of the American Criminal Jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.507" offset="19234795">It puts life and meaning into provisions that are in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.934" offset="19256529">What it really does is put into the street, if you will, put into the police station the knowledge or the protection -- protective aspects of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.003" offset="19304803">The warnings are given as now required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.947" offset="19320581">There are interrogations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.328" offset="19330090">They are continued if there is waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.414" offset="19346390">There are, as a result of Miranda and after Miranda confessions that are garnered in spite of the Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.281" offset="19381917">In the process of applying Miranda, the Court found expressly in that case, that as my brother counsel indicated, that other tests or measures to make those that are uninformed aware of these rights and to prevent police practices that were abrogating those rights, that this was the minimum requirement before admissions or confessions were allowed into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.109" offset="19485153">The Court found that in custody interrogations were inherently coercive, be they physical but in these modern days, psychological.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.679" offset="19527471">That there just as no contest between the sophisticated police officer on this side and the accused that is frightened on this side.</text>

            <text syncTime="5098.696" offset="20471536">For example, a study was conducted here in the District of Columbia to determine the degree of increase or decrease of interrogations after Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.360" offset="20506227">It was made in 1968 and cited in Michigan Law Review and it said there was no substantial variation in the number of interrogations here in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.917" offset="20548441">But that does not take away, certainly, there’s no reason, in fact, there are reason to retain the Miranda rule for it does put life into individual cases and it’s not a deterrent to law enforcement as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.319" offset="20614060">The way to determine its impact on law enforcement was to talk to those in law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.384" offset="20638302">And there are statements we plead in the briefs coming from Prosecuting Attorneys, Mr. Younger who now joins the prosecutor in opposing and filing a brief our opposition to Miranda but several years ago, he stated as District Attorney that he did not find any deleterious effect or impact as a result of Miranda in its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.428" offset="20730462">And likewise Prosecutor of Wayne my area and I myself, may the Court please, had been on law enforcement for some 12, 15 years as prosecuting attorney and sheriff of Wayne County, during this time, the changing of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.642" offset="20779363">Well, let me conclude, if I may, with just of these notations that in 1966, which I feel have bearing under practical impact of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.523" offset="20818860">In 1966, when this Court was hearing the Miranda case some 27 cases, states rather, joined in opposition to the proposed then Miranda rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.501" offset="20866717">And they are cited in the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.904" offset="20880405">Today you have that lone brief joining the Prosecuting Attorney in his urging that Miranda be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.388" offset="20910289">Miranda set standards that were minimal and to be enforced but they did not and in fact, the opinion expressly says that if States so chose as long as they met the minimal standards, they could use a different means or a mechanism to safeguard these standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.029" offset="20984895">Today, not one State has attempted to set up a different mechanism, meeting those same standards as set forth in Miranda, there is by an indirection, if not directly on occasion a reference in some of the briefs that because of Miranda, the increase in crime that’s been reported over a few years is direct or indirect result of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.976" offset="21080607">The fact is that crime is going down in many communities and in the City of Detroit it has gone down three years in a row.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.479" offset="21110700">In 1971, it went down five percent, in 1972 it went down 16%, and in 1973 it has gone down an additional five percent in round numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.575" offset="21143092">So, there was a decrease in crime in certain areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.274" offset="21161796">So, we urge it and may it please the Court that the rule not be modified or rescinded.</text>

            <text syncTime="5291.886" offset="21244343">I’ll say two points raised by counsels for the respondent as they raise in seriatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.714" offset="21271615">The first one that Mr. Mogill mentioned to the Court was a stipulation that appears in the brown appendix on page 29, where in his formation of the question, he said that what we stipulated right there, there was no independent source.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.339" offset="21330129">And since there could be no independent source, that is not our stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.475" offset="21342668">Our stipulation was, I think as one of the justices indicated was that we admit that we learned of Henderson only through Tucker but that is not to say that he could not have come forward or would not have come forward on his own because if he’s now, as your particular facts in this particular case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="5331.961" offset="21404630">But it is to say that the police had no independent source?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="l_brooks_patterson" startTime="5335.233" stopTime="5467.658">
            <label>Mr. L. Brooks Patterson</label>
            <text syncTime="5335.233" offset="21417691">At that particular time, that’s right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.756" offset="21431798">The next point raised by Mr. Mogill was that the granting or failure to apply the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine to witness' testimony would undermine the deterrent purpose of that particular rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.981" offset="21500656">And I think there’s a presumption here that the police are therefore going to go out and violate Miranda in the hopes of finding evidence of a third independent witness type and then use him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.948" offset="21556558">That’s not a very good assumption to make that police are going to deliberately violate the Miranda doctrine in the hopes of finding a third witness which the rule doesn’t apply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.311" offset="21593966">Obviously that the police are going to try in all the interrogations to say within the guidelines as the police did in this particular case of interrogating Tucker in April.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.418" offset="21634403">The -- Mr. Mogill also indicated that the Miranda has not been harmful as did Mr. Gribbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.001" offset="21668780">It has had not any harmful effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.609" offset="21675154">He said there was no evidence as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.389" offset="21682260">And Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out that here’s a case before you where we have, I think, a detriment to certainly the interest of Justice, sort of Ms Cory is concerned and the interest of the people of the State of Michigan because we’re here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.344" offset="21734087">The amicus brief that was filed with us by the International Association of Chiefs of Police on page 18 and 19, and 20 and 21, set forth nine or ten cases where the Miranda, technical violation in how the rights were administered resulted in a confession being suppressed in the case either being dismissed or sent back for re-trial, many instances tantamount to dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.756" offset="21835755">Mr. Gribbs in his argument said that these studies show that there has been no depreciable effect on law enforcement and he cites the Pittsburgh study and in Pittsburgh, in that particular study, they called the remark that Tucker gave, an exculpatory statement, they didn’t include that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.342" offset="21914122">They said, “Well, we won't consider that a statement or admission or confession purposes of this survey.”</text>
