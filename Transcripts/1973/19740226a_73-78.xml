            <text syncTime="65.977" offset="340637">It’s an exemption to the amount of $500 which, in dollar terms translated through the assessment laws of Florida, comes out to about a $15 amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.333" offset="3018083">Right, but the fact is that, as a general objective analysis, women and widows are not in the same economic classification as our widowers.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.337" offset="3106064">First of all, a woman who is a widow is either one of two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.223" offset="3129678">One, she’s the head of the household, the same as the widower and, in that case, the distinction is exactly as I’ve said that she has to -- she does not have, as a general rule, the job opportunity that the male does.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.518" offset="3198851">The other case is where she has been -- she has not been the head of the household and a widow -- then the husband is the one that dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.629" offset="3231242">And, in that case, she not only has to move over into the job market but she has to get someone to replace her and take over the duties that she had, which is really a double burden compared to the man whose wife dies who simply has to replace the functions that his wife had in the family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.226" offset="3309610">She has to do both that and move over into the job market.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.551" offset="3382962">She hasn’t -- well, I would agree that they aren’t -- that that’s true but they’re even compounded by discrimination and that the job opportunities not only to an elderly person but to her particularly are greatly lessened both by her age and by her sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.895" offset="3472300">Now, as to the general classification, the traditional test, first of all, if the Court is to use that test, then we would submit that it would be appropriate in all the tax cases where there are tax classifications, there’s a presumption of constitutionality, a heavy burden on one challenging the classification to show no conceivable permissible basis and it’s been recognized that the classification need not be exact or have mathematical nicety.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.225" offset="3633633">Clearly, if the no conceivable rationale purpose test is to be used, I’d submit that the appellant here has not met that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.021" offset="3688803">Not only is there a conceivable rational purpose, I submit, but the purpose that we’ve offered to the court is in accordance with proper tax purpose concerned for the economically disadvantaged groups in society, and that that’s a valid social concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.435" offset="3770514">Secondly, under Reed versus Reed, it’s possible that that case could be read to say that there is an additional burden that the court is going to place on the state where it makes a classification, and that’s the burden of justifying a rational classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.418" offset="3862465">And, I submit again that we have not relied on stereotypes that women are either physically not capable of doing the work that men are capable of doing or the women are in some way, because they’re the creator of children, that they should stay at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.134" offset="3961313">We’re not saying that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.153" offset="4325355">That case specifically, in a footnote, refers to in footnote 22 I believe it is, states it should be noted that these statutes and those are the statutes in Frontiero are not in any sense designed to rectify the effects of past discrimination against women citing Gruenwald versus Gardner and Jones versus Mayer and South Carolina versus Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.488" offset="4418664">And, on the contrary, these statutes seize upon a group of women who have historically suffered discrimination in employment and rely on the effects of this past discrimination as a justification for heaping on additional economic disadvantages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.817" offset="4492016">There’s no -- there is -- I mean, the second is not the case that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1115.914" offset="4540395">There is a purpose of taking affirmative action if indeed women are to be determined to be a suspect classification to reduce the results of past historic discrimination, so that even under Frontiero I would submit that it would be appropriate to approve this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.290" offset="4637884">However, I think it’s well to point out to the Court, and we submit, that this Court has, in general, limited suspect classifications to groups which sense that have been described since carrying products as discrete and insular minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.059" offset="4732970">And, I would submit that a classification based on sex does not have within it a discrete and insular minority whether be it the plaintiff here who is a male seeking to have the statute applied to him or else struck down all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.068" offset="4828996">Clearly, the male is not a minority in a group where men and women are equal and if women are anything, it would be, I guess, a philosophical minority and that they’ve been discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.399" offset="4890331">But, I know of no case where the court has found that a philosophical minority qualifies for a strict scrutiny and I think it’s proper because any group that is an interest group is a minority and it may not get everything at once out of the judicial process and it’s not for the court, every time some group other than a racial classification or an easily identifiable classification like that comes before the court to give strict scrutiny to something that doesn’t -- to a statute that doesn’t give that interest group what it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.893" offset="5080294">And, on those grounds, Your Honor, I would submit that this classification should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.446" offset="6586514">And then, finally, with respect to a point that came out yesterday, recent models for the disposition that appellant seeks in this case include the per curiam opinion last term in New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization against Cahill and early on, Mr. Justice Blackmun’s opinion in Graham against Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.404" offset="6662374">Both of those opinions dealt with constitutionally under-inclusive state rather than federal benefit statutes, and both are cited at page 27 of our main brief and in a footnote at page 8 of our reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.064" offset="6836976">The DeFunis case raises a very different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.746" offset="6851709">DeFunis is a program of a law school that is designed to open doors to equal opportunity, to assure a law student body with diverse backgrounds and experience and to what defy the conspicuous absence of minority groups in the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.711" offset="6939585">It is not a welfare, though assumed, based on the assumed inferior capabilities of any population group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.356" offset="6974171">No rigid race line is presented, as we have here, a rigid sex line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.627" offset="6991308">Race is merely one of the many characteristics assessed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.303" offset="7005936">But most significantly, DeFunis involves no general law classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.674" offset="7027461">It’s a measure addressed to very special selection problem that law schools have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.259" offset="7049822">Law schools have the very hard task of choosing some from among many applicants that are fit to pursue their educational program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.383" offset="7086289">By contrast, here we are dealing with the law, general application of the law with respect to property owners where there can be no justification for the crude device of labeling any group: racial, ethnic, or sexual as needy persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.501" offset="7146789">And, income tax is readily available to a legislature that wishes to distinguish on the basis of need, and immutable birth characteristic should be irrelevant for general law purposes.</text>
