            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1129, Cohen against Chesterfield County School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.514" offset="114834">Mr. Hirschkop, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip J. Hirschkop</label>
            <text syncTime="13.394" offset="130299">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.845" offset="144091">The issue in this case is clearly presented as one of sex discrimination, and the issue joined between the two parties as to whether or not it is sex discrimination and the Fourth Circuit very clearly went to that issue also.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.697" offset="199576">We submit to the Court especially in light of the foregoing argument, one that just proceeded that there is no question of sex discrimination in this case, that the only basis for these regulations, in fact are of appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.757" offset="251820">Now, on the course of this case, the Cohen case, we had opportunity to depose the School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.080" offset="273032">Now, we took each deposition separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.508" offset="282749">Before the lawyers present in the case could sit down with them and chat about legal rationale where they sort other opinions and could then form opinions as to the basis of the school regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.204" offset="329561">Three members of the Board and the Superintendent believed the rate of absenteeism of a teacher increases in the last four months of pregnancy and the references are on Page 4 of our brief that I am referring to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.222" offset="377626">As to the Appendix references where there are different testimonies is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.944" offset="396539">They all conceded however that they had no experience or statistics whatever with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.602" offset="415138">In fact, since they terminated women at the end of the fifth month, they had no idea what the absentee rate would be in the last three months, the last trimester of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.717" offset="459651">But in point of fact, both doctors were clear it would be lower if anything in the last three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.459" offset="486609">The difficult three months of a pregnancy are the first three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.068" offset="501029">The Superintendent and three members felt that it would be dangerous for a pregnant woman to walk down school halls and climb steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.611" offset="527151">They later or at the same time, they discussed the question fire regulations and indeed a fire marshall was put on the stand with the trial this matter to show that there occasionally were some fires in schools and were fire drills.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.157" offset="577411">There was some perhaps rather ludicrous questioning in retrospect about why -- what do you do about fat men.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.637" offset="603324">They said women who are pregnant can’t fit through narrow places; we say “what do you do about the fat men?”</text>
            <text syncTime="137.311" offset="625998">And then three members in the School Board felt that it was not good for students to see woman whose pregnancy becomes conspicuous to others and indeed we quoted ludicrous language of one of them about children seeing this teacher of 11th grade history and thinking she may have a watermelon in her belly.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.337" offset="698096">Now, that comment perhaps shouldn’t be in the Supreme Court brief other than it was stated in testimony, but it points out what is really the basis of these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.316" offset="741982">When we say the continuity of teaching argument is the real basis of these things as the appellees would have you believe from their brief, we must submit to this Court it is just not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.172" offset="789420">They are legal arguments, thought up in retrospect.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.549" offset="802900">The convincing aspect to that is in Page 26 of our brief, it’s Page 116 of the Appendix where Superintendent Kelly, in questioning by the Court, by Judge Marage (ph), agreed that he had thought of that reason in retrospect at the time of litigation, that buttress litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.853" offset="876147">Indeed it’s obvious that wouldn’t have been the reason.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="204.424" offset="894433">It’s very typical is it not of Equal Protection Clause litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="210.152" offset="917316">Usually when you are dealing with the state statute, for example, you have no legislative history and the -- then when it says the validity of the statute is attacked and is violating the Equal Protection Clause, then the effort is made post talk, if you will, to for mine the rational justifications for the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.871" offset="1008222">That’s a very typical, that’s what you find all typically and Equal Protection Clause litigation, is it not?</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_j_hirschkop" startTime="238.870" stopTime="242.112">

            <text syncTime="238.870" offset="1032255">It is not unusual Your Honor where it differs here.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="242.112" offset="1045211">And indeed the law generally is that if any rational support can be found for the law, then it doesn’t violate the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.137" offset="1085336">That’s a so-called conventional test.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.800" offset="1095993">Only if Your Honor -- only if the Court applies the rational basis test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip J. Hirschkop</label>
            <text syncTime="258.749" offset="1111771">The compelling interest test, as applied to this case, we submit it would never succeed, although we’d submit it won’t succeed on the rational basis test Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.810" offset="1148029">Justice Stewart, you have to look I think at this other matter they raised and that’s the appearance, because that’s the real background of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.675" offset="1183451">There was a question raised in previous case where at least discussion of the widespread nature of these type of regulations, and indeed they are very widespread, and maybe the real importance to this case outside of just the question of law of the test to be applied under the Equal Protection Clause is the thousands and thousands of teachers that is subject to just this type of arbitrary regulation.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="301.108" offset="1281149">Well, those are found to be very widespread, does that evidence -- they are arbitrary or capricious?</text>
            <text syncTime="305.393" offset="1298286">Wouldn’t that, if it’s evidence of anything being be that there might be some rationality behind it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_j_hirschkop" startTime="312.674" stopTime="313.893">
            <label>Mr. Philip J. Hirschkop</label>
            <text syncTime="312.674" offset="1327438">No sir I think not.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="313.893" stopTime="338.051">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="313.893" offset="1332349">If you found, for example, one exceptional school board in the whole country that had this kind of regulation, you’d have a pretty good case going in I should suppose that it’s arbitrary and capricious, but if you half of the school boards in the country with these sorts of regulations, I suppose the presumption going in would be that there must be some sort of rationality behind it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_j_hirschkop" startTime="338.051" stopTime="430.303">
            <label>Mr. Philip J. Hirschkop</label>
            <text syncTime="338.051" offset="1429002">I would think not Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.185" offset="1433496">It would be a logical inference but I would say not a legal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.959" offset="1444571">For instance in, the mixed marriage cases, there were 26 states with mix marriage laws, in the segregation cases, there were many states for segregation laws, but that didn’t lend validity to those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.391" offset="1490338">With regard to these regulations, there is a trend away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.478" offset="1502668">If there is any reference to be drawn is the overwhelming weight of authority against these laws. Just today, Civil Service Commission’s Bureau of Policies and Standards has recommended against having such standards at all in the hiring laws of the employees of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.329" offset="1582080">And as we cite Labor Department and Defense Department and other standards where these are a trend away in Virginia, every county had them at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.772" offset="1619801">The Richmond School Board does not now have such a policy, although in Rico and the surrounding counties too.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.204" offset="1645610">I’d submit to the Court that we can’t, from the widespread nature of the laws, draw any inference at this time, the 49% figure I am sure, but I should think will be higher and all kinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.323" offset="1686047">It does apply to major school boards and I have experience in this case and a companion case now coming up through the Fourth Circuit, a class action in Virginia indicates that the fact that all the counties in Virginia have such a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.810" offset="1732023">There was a question raised as to the five months versus another time and it’s conceded in this case that there is nothing magical about five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.700" offset="1759504">It’s just they have to draw a specific time so they locked on five months, but it could be four or sticks to seven in a testimony or so in our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.291" offset="1985933">There is a separate issue which again points out the arbitrariness of it on the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.313" offset="2005995">The regulations in this jurisdiction, in this school board, say that they will return -- following their pregnancy, they can return at the beginning of the next year basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.628" offset="2055210">Now, in depositions, it was pointed out that they return to a position open at the point at the time they returned, if there is a position open.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.666" offset="2087393">Plus the regulation clearly shows they are not guaranteed return to the same job, the same teaching position for which they originally contracted and they must file a certificate or give the school assurance that the trial will be taken cared off okay and of course this starts smacking the Martin Marietta case, because men don’t have to give such assurances as who is to care for an already born baby, which again, I think points out what they are really concerned about is the old fashioned look of women and child raring and child birth, which meant to the Court that the record is abundant here not just, because of watermelons and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.429" offset="2262413">Your Honor, on the notice dated at six months prior to the expected birth, they should get nervous.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.482" offset="3686713">In fact, while they have an element in this regulation that a teacher can be continued past the fifth months, if the Superintendent determines it’s for the good of the school system, we also have the testimony that he had the case that he just doesn’t continue anybody pass the fifth months.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.775" offset="3975837">Either way, there’s just no question of this being a discriminatory statute, if not only looked at as applying to woman teachers compared to other teachers, but is applying to the teaching profession as compared to the other profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.457" offset="4038531">I think an incident that happened in the course of this litigation is very fruitful here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.397" offset="4106344">Now, what is so important about teachers that’s not so important about law clerks or if such a time come as we -- clearly will come when a woman or more that one woman rise to this bench, will this Court whoever determines such regulation say you can’t sit beyond your fifth month of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.819" offset="4183980">Or will you say that Judges on Trial Courts or does anywhere acquire that of court clerks here, we believe they do not, nor thus the government require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.727" offset="4223687">Just because teachers in a unique situation historically of the year to your contract, there is no reason, they should submit, to that type of discrimination which is practiced nowhere else, whether it be in the court system the civil service system at this time, or it’s just in an anachronism that must be done away with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.834" offset="4348134">My name is Sam Hixon and I am here to represent the Chesterfield County School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.438" offset="4370495">Perhaps I’m taking the reverse approach to this case, but I wish to skip over temporarily the question of what type of test should be applied in this case and move directly to the question of what is the basis, the reasonable and rational basis for the Chesterfield maternity leave provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.896" offset="4440294">The School Board recognizes in these cases that there is an educational advantage to having a teacher full time throughout the year who can work with the individual student on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.456" offset="4490553">And it’s for that reason, that the school board requires that each individual teacher sign a written contract at the beginning of her employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.187" offset="4529528">Guarantying that she will be employed by one year period of time, this contract is a part of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.460" offset="4562547">By having one teacher without any interruption during the whole course of one year, the objective of continuity in education is accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.852" offset="4608104">With this in mind and for many reasons, the School Board, recognizes that it is making the transition from one teacher to the next to smooth and is nondisruptive as possible by the application of the Chesterfield maternity provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1149.979" offset="4676650">Mr. Hixon, I could fully understand your continuity argument, if the Chesterfield County School Board had a rule that no teacher who anticipated being pregnant during that school year would be hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.080" offset="4745091">Or if you required immediate notice as soon as the teacher knew she was pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.734" offset="4791693">But here, it doesn’t seem that to me -- at least you tell me why I’m mistaking this that it doesn’t make any difference so far as your continuity arguments goes whether the teacher leaves after four months pregnant or after eight months pregnant or after eight months and three weeks pregnant so far as continuity goes, because the pregnancy is going to be just by the ordinary pattern of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.958" offset="4888555">Could be anytime during the school year and the four months could be anytime during the school year when you take a large sample of pregnant women teachers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.779" offset="5015824">But this regulation has an advantage Your Honor and that it requires only one affirmative act on the part of the teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.346" offset="5046126">She is required six months before the expected date of delivery of her child, now which is three months after she becomes pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.833" offset="5076114">She is required to come in at that point and give the school board notice and with that one affirmative act on her part, the school board automatically at that point triggers an administrative procedure for preparing for her replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.272" offset="5137868">They can go out at this point, they can interview, they can talk to teachers and they can offer them a position at a fix point in time that is the termination of the first month of an employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.978" offset="5188650">And this is very important to the school board, because I don’t agree with what my colleague has said that the only purpose is to provide a replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.148" offset="5229296">The purposes to provide a replacement who is well qualified, who is well trained and can do the job adequately, and with this two months leave time which is effectively what we have, the school board can go out and hire and look for the most qualified teacher to come in at the end of that fifth month period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.041" offset="5312888">Now, of course the Chesterfield provision is much more flexible than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.562" offset="5330965">It provides that the School Board can extend, pass the first month of employment, the teacher, if the teacher so request and the teacher has permission of her doctor and if the school board determines that it’s in the best interest of the students, because this is essentially what we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.457" offset="5418527">Now, I have no doubt that the school board, if the final date of the five months period would fall along, let’s say May 1st and the end of the school year was May the 15th, I have no doubt that the school board would continue her until May the 15th, because it would accomplish the objective of continuity but here we don’t have that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.346" offset="5510165">We had here a situation in which Mrs. Cohen wish to teach until her 9th month of pregnancy which was, she initially requested that she teach up until April 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.369" offset="5558230">She later changed her mind and decided to terminate her employment on January 19th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.518" offset="5582785">But here we have a question where the School Board made a decision on its own whether or not it would be better from the standpoint of the students to continue the employment of Mrs. Cohen until the date that she so specified or whether it would be better for the student body and for the students to terminate her employment at the Christmas recess, which I submit seem to them to be a reasonable date for termination of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.338" offset="5698142">The record in this case clearly justifies and supports the rationality of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.542" offset="5726877">Upon Mrs. Cohen’s termination, there was a replacement that it was available, who the School Board was able to go out and hire to offer her a job on a fix date, that is, the day beginning after the Christmas vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.084" offset="5785078">To offer her that position and have her come in and remain with the students for the rest of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.680" offset="5807438">This is a continuity which was accomplished by the administrative procedure which is set up her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.603" offset="5835128">The replacement was a duly qualified teacher with a master’s degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.043" offset="5852891">Now, this is not an argument which I have contrived for purposes of arguing into this Court up to Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.971" offset="5888627">It’s an argument that is clear in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.948" offset="5904509">Dr. Kelly who is a divisional superintendent testified in the Appendix at Page 109 and also at the Page 113 why this regulation existed and why this rule existed, and it’s entirely in line with the continuity argument that I have presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.233" offset="5985698">But even if it weren’t in the question of whether or not a rule or regulation is to fall or stand under the attacks on the Equal Protection Clause doesn’t depend on the rationality which is directed towards that rule or regulation by a particular member of the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.988" offset="6064692">It can, as this Court has said on many occasions, come from the argument which are made by a counsel or can come from the Court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.093" offset="6097084">And this Court and this Court has said that if there is any reason which we can concede to support this regulation then it should be upheld under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.402" offset="6566348">The record in this case shows that the maternity provision was adapted in part by school teachers who participated, women school teachers who participated in the rules adaption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.008" offset="6608771">So, we are not really here talking about the merits or demerits of maternity leave because it’s conceded that that petitioner in this case wants the merits of maternity leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.581" offset="6927047">For example, toxemia, anemia and hemorrhagic conditions related to the placenta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.800" offset="6959961">These are conditions that occur only in a pregnant woman in these latter stages of her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.438" offset="6990472">In addition, there are obvious conditions that relate only to a pregnant woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.377" offset="7010220">For example, she has lack of balance caused by the size of the fetus in the latter months of pregnancy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.924" offset="10520451">We don’t have here a classification which treats men and women different solely because of their sex who are similarly situated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.759" offset="10831830">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.000" offset="10848758">The Court has asked several questions about the leave policies there at Page 20 and 21 of our Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.618" offset="10875193">I point out that reemployment is not automatic but only comes after a declaration of eligibility, which includes a certificate from the teacher or assurance from the teacher that she is going to care for her child or can care for a child so that doesn’t materially impair her ability to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.178" offset="10945411">As far as this leeway that teachers have, we submit it’s not so after the fifth month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.140" offset="10965264">At Page 117 of the Appendix, we have the testimony of the superintendent that no teachers on board after the fifth month, it’s their very experience which gives the light to that belief that the mere fact that’s there is that its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.271" offset="11037884">Now, we disagree basically with the other side on the -- what is the issue of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.598" offset="11071112">No question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.075" offset="11081038">All of this teacher wants, all the women want who want this thing to set aside is to be treated equally with other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.973" offset="11112594">And they’re not treated equally, because they single out this one sex related disability in terms of fact that when a pregnancy actually occurs the woman has to be gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.447" offset="11158570">The rest is just imagined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.783" offset="11163899">For instance Mr. Hixon’s argument where she’s going to go to the doctor 13 times, as someone recognized here in the Court, you can go to a doctor at other times, even though the doctor testified he does not have Saturday hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.822" offset="11212069">He is only up nothing to 4:30, Mrs. Cohen testified that’s when she tried to get there and we put her record before the Court in the District Court, she had missed two days both related to colds that she had in the five months, which is part of those 13 days in compass I believe, not missed anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.929" offset="11284480">But even if she had, so what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.969" offset="11296601">People miss time for all sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.838" offset="11308095">Could they pass a rule against a generic or a race related disease?</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.509" offset="11330769">For instance, could they have a rule of people with sickle cell anemia with a tendency of the sickle cell anemia could no longer teach in the school system when we know that that’s basically a race related disease, and yet give people with cancer or other diseases preferential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.168" offset="11393463">They could not, I submit to the Court, and get away with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.426" offset="11406420">We have a law in Virginia which is cited at Page -- Appendix 5, on a dismissal law which is statewide, and where there’s a disability as shown by competent medical evidence, a person can be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.157" offset="11461381">Now, the state treats all disabilities equally and our position in this case is that women should be treated equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.973" offset="11492624">They have no question singled out one class of persons, and I think to argue whether it’s sex related is foolishness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.246" offset="11533688">It is clearly sex related.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.840" offset="11660121">In other words, they can have a requirement that if a person is going to suffer some disability, which will force them to leave teaching during the course of the year, that person must, as soon as they know about it or within some specified date prior to disability departure time, notify the employer, the school board in this case, and in fact even fix a departure date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.283" offset="11741832">Now, that will take care of what they say, we want to plan ahead to replace the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.132" offset="11765238">The basic problem -- there is no problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.592" offset="11779135">What the problem is they single out one class of people.</text>
