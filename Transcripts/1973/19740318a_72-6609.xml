            <text syncTime="16.572" offset="143047">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.583" offset="159033">The discrimination challenged by the plaintiffs in this case is a discrimination between legitimate children born after their fathers become eligible for Social Security benefits and illegitimate children born after their fathers become eligible for Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.006" offset="228728">If Eugenio and Alicia Jimenez, the plaintiffs herein, were legitimate children, they would now be receiving Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.431" offset="266449">But because they are illegitimate, they are absolutely barred from receiving benefits, even though they have lived with their father all their lives and have been supported by him all their lives and that he has been their sole caretaker since their mother left the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.476" offset="330606">This discrimination between legitimate and illegitimate children is arbitrary and irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.706" offset="351608">It is a violation of the equal protection guarantees as embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.650" offset="379298">The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare defends the discrimination on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.178" offset="401450">That it is reasonable because illegitimate children are less likely to have received support from their fathers than legitimate children, and that it serves the valid governmental purpose of preventing fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.200" offset="461531">In fact, it is not rationally related to the purpose of the Social Security Act and it is not a rational means of preventing fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.295" offset="489953">Mrs. Stevens, if all children, legitimate as well as illegitimate, born after the date of onset of disability were excluded from coverage, would you be here?</text>

            <text syncTime="118.433" offset="550452">I think that that exclusion also would be irrational in light of the purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.919" offset="572395">In fact, before 1960, all children had to have been born and have met these requirements before the father became disabled or aged.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.298" offset="613982">But, Congress made a change in 1960 to allow children -- legitimate children to prove their dependency and their other eligibility requirements at the time application was filed on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.454" offset="666540">And now, as a result of that change, only illegitimate children are excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.906" offset="728398">Well, I think, Your Honor, that the exclusion here, if I may put it that way, is “overinclusive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="170.742" offset="759745">The Government says that they have excluded, afterborn, illegitimate children in order to prevent fraudulent claims and they have excluded with the possibly fraudulent claims a large group of, in fact, valid claimants.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.780" offset="831843">I believe it does happen, but I think that when there are less drastic means for sorting out the fraudulent from the valid claims, that those less drastic means have to be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.687" offset="879491">The hearing that would be required would be relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.001" offset="892761">The Social Security Administration is clearly able to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims and the reason it’s clear, Your Honor, is that there are 24 states that allow illegitimate children to inherit from their fathers by the laws of intestate succession.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.404" offset="962351">And in those states, children are defined the way these children are defined, that is children born and otherwise eligible after their fathers become eligible for benefits are allowed to present their claims and the Secretary seems, in those states, perfectly capable of sorting the fraudulent from the non-fraudulent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.975" offset="1036643">Therefore, it is our position that this blanket exclusion cannot be necessary to sort out the fraudulent claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.884" offset="1112294">That would be, I believe Your Honor, the major problem of proof because --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Ms. Jane G. Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="264.148" offset="1133296">There is also the issue or the possibility of a question of whether or not the child had been supported, but that is something that children who were previously born have to prove too.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.074" offset="1181048">So the only possible fraud that the Government could be depending on would be children who are not, in fact, the children of the fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.355" offset="1210201">And as this Court has pointed out, although it is difficult to prove paternity, the paternity proof cannot be an excuse for a blanket exclusion of an entire class.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.041" offset="1476963">Not necessarily, Your Honor, and I think this points up a very important factor of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.610" offset="1499220">The law depends on the law of intestate succession for giving benefits to children whose parents are still alive and so, the process by which the state will make that decision has not yet been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.775" offset="1559824">In fact, the law -- this federal law, this federal program is depending on the state law of intestate succession for the disposition of benefits while the father is still alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.261" offset="1613740">So that that process has not yet come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.223" offset="1625652">And I think that if the federal statute were to depend on a state law for definition of familial obligation, it would be reasonable for the federal statute to depend on laws that controlled support by the father while the father was still living, and this Court said only last year that once a legitimate child has been given a right to support by the father, an illegitimate child must be given that right also.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.028" offset="1728888">And I think that that decision in Gomez v. Perez should be controlling in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.143" offset="1749368">It’s not only -- in fact, the plaintiffs in this case will be eligible to receive benefits under this section after their father dies because his acknowledgment of the children while it came after the onset of disability and, therefore, does not qualify the children now will have come before his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.118" offset="1833169">And so, it will qualify them after he dies in an irrational and arbitrary manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.179" offset="2613499">And if it were so recognized, then a requirement that illegitimate children prove dependency when legitimate children did not have to, I think would be a discrimination, because in that case, the state would have to prove a stricter stand -- would have to defend the requirement against a stricter constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.360" offset="2710152">The argument that the Government is left with because of the irrelevancy of the support is the prevention of fraud argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.907" offset="2740349">And I think that in recent cases, this Court has indicated that an exclusion of an entire group of potential recipients solely for the purpose of preventing fraud and promoting administrative efficiency is not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.330" offset="2810044">This is to create an irrebuttable presumption essentially identical to that created -- to that invalidated by this Court in the United States Department of Agriculture versus Murry just last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.797" offset="2859886">In Murry, a Section of the Food Stamp Act declared ineligible any household containing a person over 18 years of age who’d been claimed as a dependent for federal tax purposes by someone not eligible for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.774" offset="2911817">And this Court found that that Section was not a rational measure and that it rested on an irrebuttable presumption often contrary to fact and, therefore, violated due process requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.759" offset="2951732">And I think that the irrebuttable presumption which is created in this case, which excludes the plaintiffs and others like them, is similarly often contrary to fact and a violation of due process because these children are not allowed to offer the proof that they meet the requirements of Section 216 (h) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="736.848" offset="3024144">If they were legitimate or if they have been born before their fathers became eligible for benefits, they would be allowed to offer their proof and, should it be satisfactory to the Secretary, they would be found eligible for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.777" offset="3075866">Now, they are totally and absolutely barred from offering that proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.853" offset="3104183">The discrimination against illegitimate children, here challenged, violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection judged by the traditional standards because it’s not rationally related to the purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.464" offset="3154651">The purpose of the Act is not simply to replace support, lost at the moment the wage earner creases being able to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.401" offset="3186312">If that were true, legitimate afterborn children would still be barred, and they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.236" offset="3209718">I think that the standard must fall for still another reason and that is that it is a discrimination based on the status of illegitimacy and illegitimacy is properly a suspect to class.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.039" offset="3260918">Several weeks ago, this Court in Johnson versus Robison indicated the traditional indicia of suspectness and said that the CO class, at issue in that case, did not possess an immutable characteristic determined solely by accident of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.363" offset="3346181">But illegitimate children possess exactly that, an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.958" offset="5204532">I would like, if I might, to begin by tracing more exactly what the statutory scheme at issue here is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.470" offset="5238596">I believe it has become somewhat confused during the opposing argument and I believe that it is crucial to perhaps the key point of disagreement between the two sides here which is on the purpose of the Social Security Act as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.159" offset="5301394">We contend that while any look of the Social Security Act can tell you that it does not derive with the Aristotelian logic from some first principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.437" offset="5338488">The basic purpose is to replace support which was lost due to the act of disability, retirement, or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.757" offset="5375791">Counsel opposite contends that to the contrary, that its basic purpose is to pay people who have a right to support or who have actual support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.084" offset="5413094">So, let us look now at what the statutory scheme actually says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.007" offset="5432738">It begins that in order to gain benefits one must be a child and child is then defined as, essentially, persons who may inherit under state intestacy laws as a child which brings in essentially all legitimate children and it brings in those illegitimate children who meet the various state law qualifications which entitle them to inherit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.776" offset="5547886">In three or four states, this is any illegitimate child from the moment of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.297" offset="5565962">In most states, I believe as Your Honor asked, it requires some statutory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.175" offset="5589473">It may be merely a written acknowledgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.842" offset="5600131">It may be merely open and notorious holding out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.178" offset="5617476">It may require a certain court action, but in any event, the child had to meet one of these qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.651" offset="5647360">Now, any of these qualifications would give it the right to inherit, which as we have indicated in our brief was one of the original indications of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.316" offset="5698038">The payments were made not to persons, but to an estate and that, specifically, this estate payment was phased out in favor of continuing payments basically to those people who could inherit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.816" offset="5747984">Then, in 1965, Congress said “Well, there are other people who we feel should be able to get benefits” and despite an advisory counsel report which they rely on, which did use the phrase “right to support or experience of support,” they wrote in specific statutory criterion and they said, “if before the parent became entitled,” that is before he became disabled, before he died, or before he became actually 64, I think, because they wanted to give you a one-year period before that 65, but if before that, one of these things has happened then you can get benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.478" offset="5930632">If your father acknowledged you in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.485" offset="5942648">No judicial scrutiny required, a simple acknowledgment, if there was a paternity order, if there was a support order, or if he was living with you or contributing to your support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.097" offset="5993117">Now, in any of these cases, it could be a reasonable assumption or a preponderant assumption that you were getting support at that time and that, therefore, your lost support when that event took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.960" offset="6048601">But I would point out that contrary to the argument made by counsel opposite, in the case of the acknowledgment or in the case of the simply “living with,” there is no necessary experience of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.496" offset="6102727">There is no necessary right to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.234" offset="6113698">There is, rather, the congressional judgment that this class of people probably lost support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.371" offset="6142224">I would further point out that this kind of judgment runs throughout the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.763" offset="6159778">For example, legitimate children who would otherwise qualify do not qualify, if they were adopted by someone else because in such a case, I think Congress reasonably judged that they probably did not lose support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.085" offset="6225084">As another example, children who become married even though they may be under 18, they may still have a right to support; they may still have an experience of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.572" offset="6271060">But, in judging that group, Congress decided that those people probably did not lose support and, therefore, that class could be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.526" offset="6310870">So that what we have here is a general congressional scheme which can be traced, I think, through categories of the Social Security law far outside children and I think one can examine almost any provision and find this kind of judgment, which says the question we look at is who is likely to have lost support and --</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.895" offset="6516297">I would state, Your Honor, that the fact that the -- the line I was beginning was the real item which needs to be explained is not why we deny payments to these illegitimates because, by definition, since they were born after the man became disabled they could not have lost support due to his disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.237" offset="6601665">The question rather is why do we allow payments to those persons who can inherit, which includes both legitimates and illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.505" offset="6638759">And as I have suggested, persons who can inherit under state law essentially also suffer a loss that the Social Security Act, we believe, may provide compensation for because, since the father could not continue earning and provide an estate since the Social Security Act no longer adds to that estate as it did up until 1939, those persons who can’t inherit, whether they’re legitimate or illegitimate, those persons who can’t inherit do suffer this loss for which we believe there can be compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.720" offset="7511667">Well, Your Honor, we believe that on the face of that distinction that there is no equal protection argue -- no equal protection problem with that, that that arises in any type of line drawing proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.202" offset="7569554">For example, if I could give you two other examples from the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.247" offset="7585750">One, we allude to in our brief which is that a woman who is married to a man who dies within nine months of their marriage cannot get widow’s benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.657" offset="7639353">Now, it is true that at eight months and thirty days I don’t know that her dependency is any less than at nine months and one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.584" offset="7675089">But, we believe Congress had a reasonable purpose in that case to prevent people from getting benefits by marrying people essentially on their death bed and you have to draw a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.498" offset="7714691">Another example which is even closer to this is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.046" offset="7732976">A husband or a parent, in order to receive benefits on the account of his wife or his child, must have been receiving one-half of his support at the time of entitlement, just like in our case, at the time of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.921" offset="7804447">So, for example, a man who is not dependent on his wife when she becomes disabled but does become dependent on her later, he looses -- he just cannot receive Social Security benefits, and the reason is that at the time of her entitlement, he lost no support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.114" offset="7885218">If he had been dependent on or the day before she became disabled or became age 65, he would receive benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.993" offset="7920744">Now granted, in any given case, the result may appear harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.069" offset="7941016">As a matter of fact, any time a person misses out under just one part of a rule, he can easily say, as counsel does here, “we could qualify if you would takeout this one rule.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.809" offset="7999948">But as we, I believe, have shown, this distinction is one that is rationally related to the purposes of the Social Security Act which is to replace support which was lost at the time the person ceased earning, that is death, disability, or age 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.087" offset="8105064">We would also like to take issue with the contention that the primary purpose of this is merely administrative efficiency, merely to prevent fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.286" offset="8157936">They’ve argued this at quite considerable length and while certainly, we believe that it has an additional aspect which is that an action such as an acknowledgment may more likely be considered reliable or more likely considered valid if it occurs at a time when that action in itself is not the thing which creates an entitlement to benefits and, in addition, when that action carries with it no other accompanying burdens or reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.728" offset="8311641">For example, in the adoption instance which was alluded to somewhat, the Secretary would have no objection, in fact, to an adoption where a court scrutiny would be required that it would be in the child’s best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.440" offset="8366498">An adoption would also place the parent under a number of other burdens and obligations, and give the child other rights other than simply qualifying him for Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.359" offset="8422191">So that in that case, the statutory criteria are tied to other indicia which would indicate the family relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.859" offset="8472137">Finally, the point was argued that this distinction is made only because illegitimates are less likely to have received support than legitimates and, thereby, raising the idea that this should be in fact judged on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.399" offset="8554371">But as we have pointed out, it is not a distinction generally between legitimates and illegitimates on the basis of their having been likely to have received support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.183" offset="8593450">Those persons born after a death, disability, or age 65 could not have received support, and that is the basic distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.588" offset="8631066">Then, those legitimates and those inheriting illegitimates or people who are legitimated, who thereby become legitimate even if in their state they could not have inherited as illegitimates, any of those people who thereby acquire inheritance rights, thereby, are also allowed to receive Social Security benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2539.589" offset="10235089">But, if his actions to date constitute an acknowledgment, then they would receive Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.662" offset="10287438">We believe that the indications that we have set out thus far do show that the statute has, while perhaps not as I’ve indicated, a basis in Aristotelian logic from a first principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.477" offset="10346684">As this Court has said, in the field of social benefits there may be a need for rough accommodations though they may be somewhat illogical under a strict logical test or unscientific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.389" offset="10398302">The social -- in the Social Security Act, and not just in the children sections, Congress has made many distinctions as we pointed out in the wives’ benefits, in the husbands’ benefits to try to limit benefits to persons who probably had lost support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.511" offset="10466743">As yet another example, children beyond the age of 18 when they may have no right to support, when they may have no experience of support individually still receive benefits if they are students because Congress has judged that, on the whole, those people are more likely to have been supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.339" offset="10558067">Now, a 21-year-old who is not a student cannot come in and offer proof that he was supported, cannot offer proof of his individual dependency because Congress has made the judgment that that is the classification that is to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.090" offset="10617104">And so, we would urge upon the Court here that this is not, in fact, a distinction made against illegitimate children on the grounds of their illegitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.453" offset="10658586">It is a distinction made, first, between those who are likely to have lost support and those who are not likely to have lost support at the time of the entitling event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.557" offset="10699024">And that, secondly, it is a payment which is made to persons who can inherit under valid state laws and who, thereby, suffer a loss which we believe Congress is entitled to compensate for.</text>

            <label>Mr. Danny Julian Boggs</label>
            <text syncTime="2676.700" offset="10783556">I believe that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.024" offset="10788885">Certainly, after this Court’s decision in Gomez, any state which requires a legitimate child to be supported, which is virtually all of the states, would require the father of an illegitimate child to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.064" offset="10857012">And that, of course is one reason why if the Court follows the rational that a right to support is all that is needed, then every illegitimate child whether there had ever been any contact with the father from the moment -- ever since the moment of conception, would also be entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.012" offset="10932767">And that, of course, is the Norton case which is presently pending on a jurisdictional statement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.817" offset="10960039">And that is why that if the true gravamen is that you can never say legitimate is different from illegitimate, then not only these children would receive benefits, but children who had never had any contact with the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.142" offset="11029316">So that the -- and as we indicated running across the law, there’s the feeling that right to support is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.611" offset="11059200">It may frequently coincide, but is not in itself, a sufficient nor the basis of the Social Security Act’s benefit payments.</text>

            <label>Ms. Jane G. Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2765.820" offset="11140075">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.938" offset="11144464">I think that the -- that counsel for the Secretary has depended on two, if I may say so, flawed arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.906" offset="11184379">The first is that the likelihood -- that the purpose of this Section is to provide support for those most likely to have lost support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.074" offset="11233071">And I think that the clear fact that legitimate children born after the onset of disability who never had support from current earnings are eligible must indicate that that cannot be the purpose of this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.426" offset="11294407">Legitimate children who have had no prior experience of support are eligible to receive these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.843" offset="11320111">And the other buttress of the Secretary’s argument is that the distinction is based on a distinction between those who can and those who cannot inherit under the laws of intestacy, and there are two weaknesses in that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.569" offset="11370998">The first is in the legislative history, in 1965, when they added this section to the Act, Congress stated and I would read a quote to you from Senate Report 404 in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.623" offset="11427213">“The committee believes that in a national program, that is intended to pay benefits to replace support for a child when his father retires, dies, or becomes disabled, whether a child gets benefits should not depend on whether he can inherit his father’s intestate personal property under the laws of the state in which his father happens to live.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.338" offset="11510073">That was not, in fact, the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.078" offset="11521045">The purpose of adding Section 216 in the first place was so that this federal program would not depend exclusively on the state laws of intestate succession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.361" offset="11566184">And the other weakness of that argument is that this is not a means for deciding who will receive benefits after a wage earner dies, but who will receive benefits while he is still alive and would be, but for his disability or age, supporting the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.135" offset="11645283">And therefore, it would be rational perhaps to depend on laws providing support, but not on the laws of intestate succession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.293" offset="11677884">In fact, Mr. Jimenez in this case has acknowledged these children formally in writing and they will be eligible to receive benefits when he dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.301" offset="11713933">And in fact, even if he had not acknowledged them in writing, they would be eligible to receive benefits when he dies because he is living with them and living with them is a means to qualify under this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.690" offset="11763461">The likelihood of support is simply not relevant in a section which makes necessary for eligibility acknowledgment or a court order which would give a right to support or the experience of support or “living with.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.304" offset="11825946">No one will qualify under this Section who has not the right to or the experience of support, no matter when he was born in relation to his father’s age or disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.280" offset="11877878">And therefore, I think that the argument on which the Secretary now apparently entirely depends, is an argument without merit and, therefore, I respectfully request that this exclusion of afterborn children be stricken from the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.676" offset="11931481">Thank you.</text>
