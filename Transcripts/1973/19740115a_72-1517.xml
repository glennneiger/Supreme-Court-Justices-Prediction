            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Levin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="59.576" offset="315037">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.032" offset="328829">This Civil Rights litigation comes before this Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and it follows a reversal in part and an affirmance in part of an opinion and an injunction issued by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.839" offset="412108">And although only two rather narrow issues remain for consideration by this Court, the litigation started out as a rather complex set of suits and motions which reigned at solving a problem of resegregation of public recreational facilities in Montgomery, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.657" offset="487340">Prior to 1959, all public recreational facilities in Montgomery were segregated as a matter of law, as a matter of city ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.310" offset="526002">In 1959, the District Court of the Middle District in the initial Gilmore case, the first stage of this case, entered an order requiring desegregation of all public recreational facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.089" offset="581068">Now, the city’s response to this order was to close all of the parks, all of the recreational facilities in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.180" offset="609489">At about that same time, 1958-1959, the city first began to cooperate with the local private segregated YMCA by entering into a coordination agreement, turning over many public recreational programs to the YMCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.281" offset="685871">Other changes throughout the 60's and in the early 70's in the recreational programs of the city brought about a situation which the original Gilmore plaintiffs sought to correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.718" offset="731638">The desegregation of recreational facilities ordered in 1959 had been effectively negated, in our opinion, by increasing resegregation throughout the decade of the 60's.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.183" offset="785450">There were three interrelated suits and motions which were filed in order to try and do what could be done to undo what we term “resegregation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="188.311" offset="829962">First, in 1970 the District Court, in response to a complaint filed against the private YMCA, found that defendant to be conducting in concert with the city extensive segregated recreational programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.998" offset="896731">The court determined the YMCA was inseparable from the city itself and ordered desegregation of the YMCA. Second, in 1970, the present petitioners, in another aspect of the Gilmore case, reopened Gilmore alleging vast inequalities in the provision of public recreational facilities to blacks in the community when compared to what whites received.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.026" offset="1012820">After one day of trial at which the court made a preliminary finding that, petitioners, plaintiffs then, had made a strong case or a strong showing of denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.214" offset="1057646">The city entered into an agreement which if followed would significantly and vastly improve recreational facilities in black neighborhoods in Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.358" offset="1102158">Third and finally, in 1972, the District Court entered the injunction, the order and opinion which really forms the basis of this particular stage of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.169" offset="1149388">There, the District Court said and actually issued a two-pronged injunction, enjoining the city from authorizing private segregated school use of public recreational facilities and also enjoining that same use by private segregated non-school clubs and organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.972" offset="1236637">The Fifth Circuit affirmed the segregated school aspect of the case only insofar as the use by the school proved to be what the Fifth Circuit termed an “exclusive use.”</text>
