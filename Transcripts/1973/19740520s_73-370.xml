            <text syncTime="4.690" offset="95504">The first of the cases is Number 73-370, National Labor Relations Board versus the Food Store Employees Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.477" offset="138658">In this case, the National Labor Relations Board rejected the argument of respondent Union, the charging party in this unfair labor practice case, that the remedy ordered by the Board should include a provision, ordering the employer to reimburse the Union for its litigation expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.748" offset="235729">The Union sought review of that refusal in the Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia circuit, and I have “agreed” with the Board, but instead of remanding the case to the Board for further consideration, the Court itself enlarged the Board's order to add a provision requiring the employer to pay not only the Union but also the Board the costs and expenses incurred by each of them in connection with the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.942" offset="380552">The Courts of Appeals, under Sections 10 (e) and (f) of the Act, have authority, and I quote the statue, to “make and enter a decree modifying, and enforcing as so modified” Board orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.857" offset="440216">What we hold in this case is the Court of Appeals action in enlarging the Board's remedies for the reasons expressed in our opinion, was an improper exercise of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.778" offset="499879">We, therefore, unanimously reverse so much of the Court of Appeals judgment, as enlarged the Board's order.</text>
