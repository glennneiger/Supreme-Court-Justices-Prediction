            <text syncTime="4.601" offset="95190">That case comes to us from the Texas Civil Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.857" offset="116193">That Court affirmed a refusal by the Texas Trial Court in Houston to entertain an application by the petitioners who were ship owners for injunctive relief against picketing that was going on at the Houston docks.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.455" offset="178573">The picketing had been undertaken by the unions because of the concern over the number of American jobs being lost to foreign ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.933" offset="212532">The picket signs called attention to this fact and made it clear they had no dispute with any vessel on the site other than these particular foreign owned vessels whom we're paying substandard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.328" offset="266031">The crews of both picketed vessels were comprised entirely of foreign national represented by foreign unions and employed under Foreign Articles of Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.858" offset="308140">The Texas Trail Court felt that its jurisdiction had been preempted by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.019" offset="332800">The Texas Court of Civil Appeals agreed and we ranted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.324" offset="350041">We find that this dispute involving as it did the maritime operations of foreign flag ships was not within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, and therefore, we reverse the judgments below.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.398" offset="406361">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
