            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">In the Chavez case, the Attorney General himself approved the application, but the application mistakenly identified the officer who actually had approved the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.428" offset="150465">This procedure also did not comply with the act, but in this case, we think that the evidence obtained from a wiretap, under Section order, is admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.305" offset="201979">Here, different from the Giordano case, the officer, required by the act to approve the application, actually did approve the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.621" offset="247223">And the mistake in identification was not the kind of a default which we think under the terms of the act requires the exclusion of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.000" offset="296751">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had arrived with the opposite conclusion in this respect, and so we reverse their judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.558" offset="334994">There is another aspect of the judgment in which we agree with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.226" offset="361639">Mr. Justice Douglas joined by Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stewart, and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
