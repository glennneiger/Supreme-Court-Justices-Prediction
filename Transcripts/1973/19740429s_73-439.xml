            <text syncTime="15.596" offset="139180">These cases are here on petitions for certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.776" offset="175856">The litigation in the District Court in New York is based upon diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.288" offset="213891">There is a single question of law that has emerged so far in this litigation and that is, what is the law of Florida that governs this critical central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.421" offset="282436">Now the courts below very quite proper in looking to Florida law under the area -- its competence to determine what the resolution of the question is, because this corporation is a Florida corporation and the members of the Court of Appeals were divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.556" offset="382955">There has been a much discussion and debate about the question of what the Florida law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.402" offset="414407">There are no Florida decisions, and the Courts of Appeals with Court Appeals and the District Court both made valiant efforts to figure out what the Florida law was by analogous cases and other states including New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.089" offset="493087">There are ten states in the country now that have a provision or by statute or by court rule, a federal District Court or a federal Court of Appeals or this Court and certify to the Supreme Court of the state, these laws involved, a question and they have jurisdiction to resolve that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.500" offset="606772">We have used it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.009" offset="616803">We don’t say that in this case, the Court of Appeals should use it, but we think it is a matter for them in their discretion to consider on the remand of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.621" offset="663197">Therefore, we reverse and remand on that point only.</text>
