            <text syncTime="55.390" offset="298318">The Western Alfalfa Plant had been under investigation and surveillance by the state authorities for approximately two years prior to June 4, 1969, at which time an investigator for the state made a trip into the area where the plants are located and they made emissions and opacity readings.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.834" offset="412108">The opacity readings exceeded the limits which were allowed by the state at that time, which were 40 % opacity or a Number 2 Ringelmann, by approximate 40 and 45 % of the Ringlemann, and opacity readings which were taken by the inspector were double in some instances what were allowed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.026" offset="508865">The inspector made these opacity readings by driving up to the plant from a county or public road, driving on to the parking lot of a particular plant, taking the opacity readings, recording them, and taking photographs, and got into his car, and returned or went on his route of investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.285" offset="4441861">And this reasoning is not logical on two basic premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.957" offset="4472581">Number one; Western had an opportunity at the hearing before the Board to put on whatever evidence it desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.540" offset="4498913">What it did put before the Board was a testimony from a Vice President that he had hired Mr. Richard Roning (ph) some months before this June 4, 1969 incident to take readings and that it was his opinion that their emissions did not exceed the 40 % opacity limited by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.865" offset="4592222">There was no evidence that Mr. Roning(ph) was qualified to take opacity readings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.374" offset="4618240">They also hired a local engineering firm to do a study of their emissions, after the cease and desist order was issued, but they did not comply with the other statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.083" offset="4669127">The statue provides that if you are going to have an emission particulate study that you must notify the division and the division must be present during the time that the study is made so that it can determine that the methods used have some correlation to the Ringelmann and opacity readings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.257" offset="4757734">So Western put evidence before the Board which was not competent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.919" offset="4780408">It could have had a qualified opacity or Ringelmann reader on its premises taking readings everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.059" offset="4813009">It is required to have its operation in compliance everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.403" offset="4830354">In fact, the law provides that if the emissions exceed the 40 % opacity for three minutes during any one hour, then it is in violation of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4316.459" offset="17342589">First of all, they indicated that the officer involved should have a prior justification for being whether it was a legitimate reason to be there unconnected with the search that is being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.007" offset="17436735">It reiterated again the case did that plain view doctrine did not -- it was still true that no intrusion is justified without a careful determination of necessity and that the discovery of the evidence involved must be an inadvertency that where you go on to a person’s property looking for something as the inspector did here knowing that he was going to make a search, it can be hardly said that what he found was -- he justified because it was in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.974" offset="17616666">I think in this case or one another one similar to it the court indicated that if you poke around long enough you can always find something in plain view.</text>

            <text syncTime="4958.732" offset="19911680">The court in that situation said there may be a statuary scheme authorizing entry without warrant but as long as no particulars are spelled out, no limitations are spelled out the requirements of Fourth Amendment still apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="5117.039" offset="20544888">There has been some talk that the timeliness is needed and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.277" offset="20569861">In Colorado Rule 41, a warrant -- there is no limitation on how good long, you can get a warrant for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.168" offset="20593371">For a reasonable time, because we can one – lasts for two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.656" offset="20607373">Anytime you go by, you are ready to go there with a warrant and if you have any reason to be -- if you think you are going to refused get your warrant before you go.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.409" offset="20642377">There is indication for example, on this case, inspector setting on this June 4th morning, June 6th to visit these three plants and issue citations; he could have taken a warrant along with him, the result of the case would have been exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.946" offset="20700578">The evidence would have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.823" offset="20707997">I don’t think that he said that the lack of his having to get a warrant would have impeded his activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.606" offset="20771213">We have talked about system indeed all the way through this that the accused should have notice of the inspector being there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.351" offset="20810188">Now, aside from this affording the right to object to an inspection being made, evidence being gathered, I think it should be noticed that this is not an uncommon statutory scheme as referred to in the government's brief, generously provided with more example than I could have thought of, where the credentials must be shown before you can go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.725" offset="20915618">Indeed, the Federal Clean Air Act for just these types of inspections; Federal Water Pollution Act and Mine Safety Act; all require that before you make an inspection, you show your credentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.264" offset="20965773">This is not uncommon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.258" offset="20969744">The Colorado Law as it now reads, you must get consent or a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.686" offset="20987507">Well, obviously you can get consent even you don’t even ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.331" offset="21002031">The person doesn’t know you are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.779" offset="21011853">So, in effect it requires you to come up and give notice that you are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.131" offset="21049260">A curious example, speaking of the Colorado Law is that if you are going to take a tangible sample of whatever you have looked at in air pollution, you are required to give it to the person you took it from.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.705" offset="21111536">This is strange that the Colorado law says that if you are going to take a visual impression of whatever you are charging the evidence of, there is no requirement that person from whom or on whose property you take this visual impression, hasn’t got a right to be there simultaneously and look at the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.069" offset="21189068">Look, this is what I want to charge you with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.744" offset="21195755">That's all we have asked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.392" offset="21210279">So, you would have a chance to look yourself and see what is there, have some way of answering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.785" offset="21231909">We did complain somewhat bitterly and maybe at too much length and our people going to the smoke school run by the State of Colorado; we are not certified that they were competent, that they have taken the smoke schools so that they could testify with the same degree of credibility, the State Inspectors did, but perhaps the point is we had no opportunity to look at that dissipating, evanescent, here and now and gone for ever evidence that violation is based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.049" offset="21392927">We spent a good deal of time in our brief talking about the constitutional adequacy of the Ringelmann test; I don’t propose to go into that in greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.018" offset="21432842">Then the court by its questions as indicated is concerned with sufficiency of that as a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.624" offset="21475265">We did direct the court's attentions and perhaps we have already -- the situation in the Pennsylvania Power case, I only have the report in the environmental law reporter and state implementation plan was turned down by the Federal Court Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.645" offset="21547363">Because the instrument of enforcement was the Ringelmann test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.456" offset="21570560">And I am sure that case was going to end up here before it is finished because as Justice Department of Attorney indicated this is a very common provision in these implementations plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.874" offset="21624268">There is a crude test granted as quick, speedy, hit it and go sort of thing, but it is not a very good indication of how much actual emissions, pollutants if you please are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.833" offset="21708069">I can’t help but think is important that the Colorado Law has changed since this all came up and as Mr. Tucker has indicated they can’t do what they are trying to justify and urge this Court, they should be able to do even now under Colorado Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5587.851" offset="22428108">I think to answer your question that you asked earlier Mr. Justice White, the fact that there was a trespass, doesn't make any difference, says this Court articulate in the Katz case and the Court said, assuming that the Officers were both trespassers and lacking in probable cause, Fourth Amendments protections do not extend to the open field area surrounding a dwelling and the immediate adjacent curtilage and therefore information gained as a result of a civil trespass on open field is not constitutionally obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.379" offset="22570214">The pictures and the testimony of Inspector Tailor show that he observed this plume of smoke before he was actually on the premises of Western Alfalfa. He had justifiable cause to enter on to the premises and obtain the evidence which he did and that was an opacity reading of the smoke plume or the plume which they were putting in to the atmosphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.292" offset="22677943">Counsel has stated in his argument that the evidence would be the same if a warrant had been obtained and that is exactly correct and therefore a warrant would serve no useful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.969" offset="22736666">If the State had had a warrant or had obtained consent, the evidence would be exactly the same because Western Alfalfa or none of these operations have a trained smoke carrier on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.726" offset="22787657">They would not have been able to take opacity readings of their own on that particular day and in fact after they received the cease-and-desist order, some twelve days later, they still didn’t take any opacity readings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.196" offset="22845544">So consent or a warrant would not change the fact situation at all and would not change the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.013" offset="22876787">So, it is a useless gesture to require the state to go through the process of obtaining a warrant.</text>
