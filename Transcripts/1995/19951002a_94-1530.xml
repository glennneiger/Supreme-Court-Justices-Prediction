            <text syncTime="15.031" offset="193905">The case before the Court today concerns whether an order of a district court remanding a case on jurisdictional or other than equitable grounds, a case which had been removed pursuant to Federal Bankruptcy Court jurisdiction, may be reviewed for error in the circuit court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.424" offset="279482">It is petitioner's contention that the bankruptcy removal statute, 1452 of title 28, which prohibits review in the circuit court of equitable remands does not apply to the remand in this case, as it was on jurisdictional or other than equitable grounds, and that the general removal statute, 1447, has no application in the bankruptcy removal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.236" offset="402675">Since neither bar to review is applicable to the remand in this case, which was premised on a demonstrably erroneous holding that the removal was simply untimely, petitioner Things Remembered should be permitted to appeal this remand and to seek the correction of that holding.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven D. Cundra</label>
            <text syncTime="190.965" offset="897643">One has to consider the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.628" offset="908301">The context is the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.481" offset="923661">Prior to 1978, this country's bankruptcy jurisdiction was extremely limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.456" offset="943619">The only jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court was that referees in bankruptcy who had the jurisdiction, which was called summary jurisdiction, which was only property in the actual or constructive possession of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.044" offset="997954">There was also plenary jurisdiction, but it was only by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.898" offset="1013314">In 1978, Congress determined that the Bankruptcy Act was not being effectively administered... Chapter 11 cases, what are now Chapter 11 cases were not being effectively administered, and it passed a brand new statute with a very broad jurisdiction over all cases arising in, arising under, or related to a bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.651" offset="1096383">And Congress determined that in order to be effective it had to grab all litigation in whatever court, Federal, State, or tribal, and bring it into one central forum so that the bankruptcy court could adjudicate the estate of the debtor and adjudicate in a fair manner consistent with the interests of all creditors, not just the two private litigants, and it created the central forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.428" offset="1203485">It created a new court which ultimately the delegation of power was so great to an Article I court this Court struck down that statute, or had it amended in the Northern Pipeline and Marathon decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.870" offset="1261268">But that's what justified the broad jurisdiction to get all matters before one court.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.025" offset="1285823">It justified the removal statute, which is unlike any other removal statute, reaching into any court, even a Federal court, to bring a case before the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.714" offset="1328664">But recognizing there may be inequities in that even though it was to prevent delay of bankruptcy cases, it provided a broad remand power to the bankruptcy judge which would not be reviewable, and that remand power that was not reviewable was not only for decisions to remand but also for decisions not to remand, a bar to appellate review in that context that does not appear in the general removal context, 1447.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.583" offset="1456141">A decision not to remand is reviewable under 1447.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.628" offset="1476308">A decision not to remand under 1452 is not reviewable, because it's a discretionary decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.468" offset="3291609">First, you have to relate it to what the basis of the enactment is, which is this broad expansion of jurisdiction in the bankruptcy courts with the corresponding remand, and with jurisdiction not being defined, not delineated by Congress... very broad, related to the case, but not delineated, left to the courts to flesh out that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.924" offset="3381470">Now, that jurisdiction, because bankruptcy courts before only had summary jurisdiction, had no in personam jurisdiction, now that jurisdiction of related-to means all of this litigation we are going to be removing from State or Federal courts that were never removable under bankruptcy before, never.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.786" offset="3444896">And how should we delineate that related-to jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="831.759" offset="3460778">Congress didn't delineate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.149" offset="3466316">It left it to the courts to delineate it, and since it's only being delineated or defined by the courts in removal cases, we needed to have the court of appeals review that and establish a Nationwide understanding of what this new jurisdiction is that never existed in our history before.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.561" offset="3548027">Is it not true that in view of the larger docket in the bankruptcy courts they also gave additional grounds for removal on any equitable ground, which presumably might have been intended to pick up the problem in the Thermtron case that if the docket is heavy in that court, they think the case might be disposed of more promptly in the court it was originally filed, therefore they have power to remove.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.352" offset="9523172">I think this is an important... the Bankruptcy Reform Act was intended to be a fair and credible statute, and to operate quickly and efficiently, and to have these disputes resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.711" offset="9572595">Now we're here, 3-1/2 years, going on 4 years after this simple State court breach of contract action was filed in Summit County, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.989" offset="9613764">We're here coming up on 4 years on this case, and we haven't litigated anything other than the question of where this case ought to be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.885" offset="9649291">Now, the petitioner had indicated in its reply brief that that's because we didn't do anything to prosecute that case in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.432" offset="9679488">That is not... not necessarily correct, Your Honor, because we did attempt to have... and this ties in with the question that I believe Justice Kennedy had earlier of whether or not in this case was there a claim removed, or was the entire case removed, and I believe Mr. Cundra indicated that the entire case was removed, which is also why you get back to 1447.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.495" offset="9771753">But we have attempted to litigate this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.298" offset="9782933">We filed a motion in the State court to have a status conference set and get a trial date, and the petitioner's response there was that the trial court had absolutely no jurisdiction over that case because the entire case had been removed and was now pending before the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.557" offset="9852001">So we have attempted to litigate those issues, and we've been estopped from doing that because there is no jurisdiction in the State court because the entire case has been removed, which answers the question of whether this was a claim or a case that was removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.130" offset="9918247">The entire case was removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.790" offset="9924935">It was removed from a State court, and it was remanded on jurisdictional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.713" offset="9944579">I think that ties you directly back in to 1447, and the order is not reviewable, on appeal or otherwise, by the Sixth Circuit or even by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.119" offset="9982195">Mr. Cundra indicated that somehow there was a defect in the remand procedure because the order... or, excuse me, the motion to remand was filed sometime in November of 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.310" offset="10051054">It's correct, as he indicates, that there were two separate removals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.365" offset="10071221">One was a removal to the bankruptcy court, and one was another removal to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.858" offset="10093163">Those were ultimately consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.050" offset="10101941">There were two separate remand motions filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.733" offset="10116674">One was filed on October 23 of 1992, and if you look at the joint appendix at page 2a, it gives you the chronology of those events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.689" offset="10152514">That's well within the 30 days provided for the time to file the remand motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.592" offset="10176128">Those cases were then consolidated, and Judge White of the bankruptcy court addressed that issue and found that the motion had been timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.688" offset="10212491">At any rate, this argument, similar to other arguments, as we indicate in our brief were not preserved because the petitioner did not complain about the results that came out of the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.489" offset="10267766">They were satisfied with the fact that the bankruptcy judge was going to ship the case off to New York, so when we filed our appeal, they didn't appeal any of those rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.687" offset="10308517">And I would analogize this to, let's say, a personal injury case where a plaintiff files a personal injury action and gets a plaintiffs' verdict, but for an amount that maybe that person is not necessarily satisfied with, or the defendant files a notice of appeal on the liability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.269" offset="10382809">The plaintiff cannot sit back and go through that whole procedure at the court of appeals and then come to this Court or to the court of appeals and argue at oral argument that they want to have the case... have an additional amount of judgment, that they're appealing the amount of the verdict that was rendered in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.624" offset="10460236">In this case, they've waived their right to raise a number of these arguments that they're raising now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.168" offset="10478417">There was a question posed as to whether or not Thermtron in the bankruptcy context reaches the correct result, that being that in the bankruptcy context, if the case is... if, for example, the bankruptcy judge says that my docket is too crowded and I want to remand this, petitioner's position is that under 1452, that that's the correct result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.497" offset="10595759">Well, that just doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.410" offset="10603387">That flies in the face of the history behind this Court and this Court's decisions on the basis for remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.547" offset="10655945">The bankruptcy court itself did rule on the motion to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.395" offset="10699309">Mr. Cundra indicated that the bankruptcy court did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.768" offset="10712892">The bankruptcy court found that the removal was not timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.510" offset="10727834">The bankruptcy court also found, as I believe Justice Kennedy pointed out, that the general removal was timely, and again, that ties back into our argument that we're here on the 1447 question, not on the 1452 question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.398" offset="12815332">And I'm on page 51 thereof, where it indicates presumably an order of the bankruptcy court refusing to accept jurisdiction and in effect remanding the matter to another court would not be appealable in the same manner that an order of the United States district court remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable, on appeal or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.227" offset="12918672">And then they footnote there as authority for that 28 U.S.C. 1447(d), and also this Court's decisions in a number of cases, including the Thermtron case, so Congress was aware of the 1447 scheme at the time that it enacted 1447, and I think your analysis can also be used to plug that in as a 1452.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.715" offset="13080631">As we indicated in our brief, there are a number of other special removal statutes, and we cited a couple of cases under the Federal Drivers Act, and also under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act, and those cases, in those statutes there are specific removal and remand provisions that are set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.611" offset="13176239">And those cases also indicate, although they are not decisions of this Court, they are decisions from other circuit courts of appeals, that in enacting those statutes, that Congress did not intend to set aside 1447 and in fact 1447 does apply to those other statutes that also have very specific remand... removal and remand procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.788" offset="13280938">I cite the Court to that authority which again is not from this Court, it's from other circuit courts of appeals, but as authority for the congressional intent not to repeal by implication 1447 at the time that it enacted 1452.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.474" offset="13667655">I mean, normally, the "or otherwise" is because you often review on mandamus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.095" offset="13746127">But if it was really a case of subject matter jurisdiction, the Constitution would trump any such statute, right, because Article III says what Congress can tell the Federal court they can do.</text>
