            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80991">I have the opinion in O’Hare Truck Service versus City of Northlake to announce for Justice Kennedy who is absent today.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.770" offset="128011">This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.720" offset="147864">It is an opinion that raises issues that have parallels to those raised in the one I just announced Board of Commissioner versus Umbehr.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.177" offset="193631">The petitioner in O’Hare Truck Service versus City of Northlake is a man named John Gratzianna.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.543" offset="223097">His company O’Hare Truck Service was in the automobile tolling business and important part of the business depended on referrals from the City of Northlake, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.900" offset="264580">For at least 30 years, the City had maintained a list of tolling companies which they have acceptable service.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.168" offset="289657">When the police received the tolling request, they would call the company next on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.067" offset="309197">According to O’Hare’s complaint, O’Hare was removed from the list when Gratzianna refused to support the mayor in his successful re-election campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.390" offset="358516">O’Hare’s proprietor Gratzianna instead supported the campaign of one of the opponents of the mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.836" offset="388295">In the District Court and in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the complaint was dismissed in accord with Seventh Circuit precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.748" offset="419956">Cases from this Court such as Elrod versus Burns and Branti versus Finkel protect public employees from discharge based on their political affiliation unless that affiliation is a reasonable requirement for the job in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.694" offset="483695">The Seventh Circuit declined to extend Elrod and Branti to the protection of independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.604" offset="511384">We now reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.343" offset="522356">Gratzianna was targeted with a specific demand for political support and on his refusal the City terminated the relationship that based on longstanding practice; he had reason to believe would continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.894" offset="576482">We see nothing that distinguishes this on the type of coercion exercise in the long line of our cases holding that the government may not condition public employment on an employee’s exercise of his or her First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.799" offset="636145">We see no reason why the constitutional claim here should turn on the distinction between employees and independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.652" offset="667597">The Constitution accords government officials a large measure of freedom as they exercise discretion adherent in making decisions by the contracting of goods and services but the First Amendment does not deny independent contractors safeguards for exercising rights of political association and political affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.339" offset="750248">The opinion for the Court was authored by Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.095" offset="769370">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed the cases remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.088" offset="785252">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
