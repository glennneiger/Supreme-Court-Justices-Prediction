            <text syncTime="25.078" offset="239328">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="32.882" offset="270466">The true total population of the United States is unknown and perhaps unknowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.017" offset="291051">At every 10 years for the last 200, the United States Government has been making the best effort possible to count every person it could in compliance with Article I, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.404" offset="340579">The 1990 census was no exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.215" offset="351864">By all accounts, it was the most well organized and most thorough census in history, accounting for 98.4 percent of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.122" offset="383420">Since at least 1790, people informed about the census taking process--</text>

            <text syncTime="66.514" offset="405049">If the true population is unknown, how can one be sure that the most recent census accounted for 98.4 percent?</text>

            <label>Mr. Drew S. Days, III</label>
            <text syncTime="75.330" offset="440262">--Well, it's an estimation, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.260" offset="447994">It's the best we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.322" offset="452278">I think everybody has recognized that there's no such thing as a 100 percent accurate census, and that's very much bound up in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.217" offset="483834">Since at least 1790, people familiar with the census taking process have realized that the process does not locate everyone in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.692" offset="517689">In fact, in 1790 George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were convinced that the population of the new nation would be 4 million, and they were not persuaded otherwise when the census came in at 3,890,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.010" offset="567008">But since at least 1940, the Census Bureau has recognized that there's something called a differential undercount, that is, that certain minority groups, certain racial groups are undercounted, not captured by the census to the same degree as non minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.553" offset="633150">In this case the responses... the respondents contend that a statistically adjusted alternative to the actual count should have been adopted by the Secretary of the Commerce because of its alleged superior ability to correct for this differential undercount.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.382" offset="696471">The Secretary, however, declined to do that, relying upon the actual count because he believed that it provided a more reliable basis for apportioning Representatives among the States, which after all is the primary purpose of the census, and he did not believe it promised to cure the differential undercount in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.175" offset="771704">The district court upheld the Secretary's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.687" offset="785705">On appeal, however, the court of appeals determined that the Secretary, by failing to adopt the statistically adjusted alternative, did not make... and I quote... a good faith effort to achieve the objective of equal representation for equal population and remanded the case to the district court where the Secretary was going to be required to show that his decision was essential to the achievement of a legitimate governmental objective in order to avoid a declaration of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.876" offset="902420">We're here seeking reversal of the judgment of the court of appeals on remand with directions of entry of judgment for the petitioners because we submit that the Secretary's decision, following a 200-year tradition, was within the range of options afforded by the Constitution to the Secretary and that what the court of appeals did was failed to show the proper level of deference to the Secretary's decision that he is entitled to in carrying out his responsibilities with respect to the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.056" offset="1023211">One of the first things that the court of appeals failed to do was recognize the broad delegation that the Constitution gives to Congress and Congress in turn gives to the Secretary of Commerce in carrying out the census process.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.995" offset="1086949">Article I, section 2, clause 3 says that the Congress shall conduct the census in such a manner as they shall, by law, direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.020" offset="1119028">And Congress by statute says that the Secretary may conduct the census in such form and content as he may determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.917" offset="1150584">These are very broad delegations to both the Congress and to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.059" offset="1171168">In conformity with his powers under statute and under the Constitution, the Secretary of Commerce made three decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.374" offset="1204500">The first was to put distributive accuracy, that is, the ability to allocate population among the States so that apportionment of Representatives among the States can be carried out in a responsible fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.354" offset="1264373">He was going to use that as the principal focus of his analysis in comparing the actual count and the statistically adjusted count.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.429" offset="1296660">His second determination was that the statistical adjustment had to be shown to be superior with respect to distributive accuracy if he were going to use that instead of the actual count.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.248" offset="1339919">And the third was, after great deliberation and analysis, the Secretary decided that the adjusted count was not superior to the actual count and, therefore, he went with the tradition of 200 years and made the actual count the official census of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.523" offset="1501042">It talks about actual enumeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.506" offset="1508984">It doesn't even use the word "census".</text>
            <text syncTime="344.157" offset="1515567">It says actual enumeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.597" offset="1521314">Do you think that that could be complied with by Congress saying, well, we think the population of the country overall has increased 5 percent and, therefore, we think every State... chances are every State has increased more or less 5 percent?</text>
            <text syncTime="359.607" offset="1577425">Close enough for Government work.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.258" offset="1587978">Well, Justice Scalia, I think the approach that you were just describing was in fact what the Framers engaged in when they came up with Article I, section 2, clause 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.335" offset="1632282">It was an estimate.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.309" offset="1664151">--That's true, but I think that what the term actual enumeration really suggests is that the Framers wanted to leave open to the Congress and later to the Secretary of Commerce the ability to rely upon developments with respect to nose counting or head counting.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.059" offset="1723188">But I think one can say about the term "actual enumeration" that there has to be a good faith effort by the Congress and by now the Secretary of Commerce to count bodies, to find people.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.569" offset="1769268">And, therefore, a totally synthetic census I think would be contrary to the constitutional objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.470" offset="1792882">But going further, General Days, and using this PES adjustment, at least the district judge, McLaughlin, was confident that that was an appropriate way.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.049" offset="1843142">He said, if I were free to decide on my own, that's what I would use.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.511" offset="1857039">And he had a footnote, and I wanted to ask you particularly about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.933" offset="1874698">He said, in light of recent improvements in statistical tools, that the use of the adjustment in the next census is probably inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.061" offset="1915240">So, my question is, has the Government... it's now 1996.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.571" offset="2569242">Well, that may well be but, Justice Scalia, if we are successful to the extent that we would like to be in this suit, we think there would be a cutting back on challenges to determinations made by the Secretary of Commerce in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.112" offset="2627442">If appropriate deference is shown to the Secretary in making these decisions, which are myriad, in coming to a conclusion as to what should be done with respect to the census, what types of adjustments should be made, then I don't think that we have to experience what was the case after the 1980 census in which there were 50 lawsuits that... over 50 lawsuits that weren't concluded until 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.876" offset="2714482">Our principal point is that there are some types of challenges that deserve to be in court when there's an indication of intentional racial discrimination, when the Secretary of Commerce wants to hold a decennial census every 15 years rather than every 10 years, or where it's clear that the Secretary is not trying to count anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.890" offset="2798492">Those may well be appropriate matters for courts to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.834" offset="2818345">But what the respondents have really invited the courts to do in this case... and certainly the court of appeals seems to have accepted the invitation... was for the courts to take sides in a statistical dispute among statisticians and demographers about the propriety of a statistical adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.274" offset="2892011">We do not think that that's the type of dispute that properly belongs in Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.784" offset="3190120">After all, what the Secretary of Commerce is doing or was doing in 1990 was relying upon experience that the Census Bureau had gained ever since marshals went around in 1790 from door to door asking people who lived in their households.</text>

            <text syncTime="1108.606" offset="4573356">We're talking about missing 4 million people approximately in a population of 248 to 253 million, which is a pretty good record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.014" offset="7431047">Let me say at the beginning that the court of appeals did not hold that Secretary Mosbacher's decision was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.431" offset="7464693">It only held, as I understand it, that the district court had employed an inappropriate standard when it found that the Secretary's decision, though mistaken, must be sustained because not so far beyond the pale of reason as to be arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.713" offset="7533865">There should be no question about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.043" offset="7595096">The basis was, first of all, 13 days of trial and the consideration of the evidence submitted there, but I think very largely on the basis made of concessions made by the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.630" offset="8021519">So, in fact, a census system that adjusted upwards by 1 percent according to diet would be more accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.467" offset="8052866">Yet, a system like that couldn't possibly be a more lawful system because you'd produce bizarre results in trying to apportion Representatives among the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.975" offset="8102917">So, I don't see how that could be the test as opposed to the test being are we going to do our apportionment business of Representatives in Congress better.</text>

I think the key factors here are that the Census Bureau, the expert agency, to which normally I would suppose considerable deference was due, had spent a great deal of time trying to figure out the solution to the problem, after an enormous amount of effort and a very professional effort had decided that it had figured out the solution, or at least a significant amelioration of the problem, and I must say, Justice Breyer, repeatedly advised the Department of Commerce that there was no other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3163.930" offset="12794718">First... and I think this is something that courts are quite as capable of addressing as the Secretary of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.935" offset="12826691">Everyone knew going into this that what was going to go on was the substitution to some extent of random error, the error derived from sampling, as against what the statisticians call but we also call bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.347" offset="12900357">And the Secretary has decided here, among other things, that he prefers bias to random error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.082" offset="12931286">And I think the courts are entitled to say that's something one ought to look at very closely because the bias that the Secretary preferred over random error is consistently, persistently decade after decade falling in the same places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.355" offset="13004429">It doesn't float around and it has a very distinct sense of unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.960" offset="13030760">There are a lot of respects in which we use random methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.182" offset="13043717">When we pick a jury or when we pick a draft, we use random methods because there is a heightened sense of equity in it, and I think that's a relative consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.047" offset="13079139">But secondly, the Secretary had agreed with us in the stipulation which this case produced on a mechanism that was going to be employed as part of the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.656" offset="13125637">At the time he did that, he had before him the machinery that the Census Bureau had prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.009" offset="13151028">The decision he finally came to, after... and everyone agrees that the post enumeration survey was excellently conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.245" offset="13187913">The Secretary doesn't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.857" offset="13194391">So, the decision he finally came to was a decision he could have come to before he started because he knew that a measurable, foreseeable amount of random error was going to be interjected into the affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.305" offset="13248203">I think that's inconsistent with, if you like, it's not in good faith with, the stipulation that he entered into at the beginning saying we're going to conduct this post enumeration survey and we're going to conduct it as part of the census under the ground rules, under the tests, under the standards that the Bureau has set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.717" offset="13317794">At the end of the day, it met all those tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.588" offset="13329287">Suddenly there was a change of grounds of decision, a change of the rules of decision, if you like, and I think that is suspect and requires further attention from a court, or at least I think that's what the Second Circuit was saying.</text>
