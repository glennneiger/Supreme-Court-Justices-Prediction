            <text syncTime="90.323" offset="502940">First of all, historically this Court has given de novo review for constitutionally enshrouded issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.005" offset="521644">Secondly, de novo review furthers the appellate directive of developing the law, making consistency in the law, and basically in error-correcting, and thirdly, we believe that the decision, or, strike that, the de novo review standard is consistent with the principles enunciated in Gates v. Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.448" offset="603459">This Court has in the past addressed issues that are encapsulated in the Fifth Amendment, and basically it has determined that de novo review is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.596" offset="644001">In the Keohane decision, this Court basically said, although the issue of voluntary... strike that, of custody is fact-laden, in other words, the issue is a question of what facts occurred during the course of the custody, still we believe that the question of whether, in fact, the person was in custody for the purposes of Miranda requires de novo review.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.036" offset="965830">In the Ker case, in fact, the Court said that when it is to be... it's considering a constitutionally enshrouded issue, and specifically Fourth Amendment, it's going to be an independent review, and the importance of that is to assure that the Fourth Amendment as a constitutional right is, in fact, upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.049" offset="1029882">Similarly, the Court decided the same principle in Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.551" offset="1043884">In Carroll and Brineger, again, those two decisions were based on a fundamental reevaluation of the law and, based on that reevaluation of the law, some of the cases were overturned, and some of them were affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.099" offset="1094039">In the Cortez case, which was a case decided by this Court, the lower court determined that the decision satisfied the definition of clearly erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.183" offset="3294385">Because the court of appeals applied the clear error standard, we're left not really knowing what the court of appeals itself thought was the correct result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.076" offset="7070019">It seems to me that this could be the occasion for defining what a court of appeals is supposed to do in performing a clearly erroneous review, and when I was talking about questions of law perhaps affecting the analysis of the probable cause issue, I think of Justice Scalia's example of the turntable, with whether or not you've got something, whether it amounts to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.450" offset="7151417">That narrow question can be considered to be a legal question, when you pick up the turntable and look at the thing that's not in plain view.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.744" offset="7176599">Yes, but the question in that case was the degree of intrusion, and you're going to say, well, there was just a wee bit of intrusion when he looked under it, and therefore it was clearly erroneous to say that you had not sort of departed from your reasonable standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.398" offset="7259250">I think that that strikes me as sort of crossing the line into de novo review, even though you're not saying that's what you're doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.279" offset="7278790">Well, you... there may be a distinction between whether something constitutes a search for purposes of whether you pick the de novo or clearly erroneous review versus probable cause or reasonable suspicion determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.750" offset="7332707">And part of the reason for that is the history that was recited by this Court in Illinois v. Gates, where this Court had attempted to look for recurring fact patterns and to try to develop a set of rules that would provide the kind of guidance that opposing counsel have suggested is provided in each one of these highly fact-specific cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.061" offset="7409925">And the Court's experience was that it was becoming impossible to kind of draw these distinctions on appeal, and that we have to adopt a totality of the circumstances rule specifically recognizing that these fact patterns really do vary from situation to situation and that, while you think you may be identifying a common fact pattern, in fact there may be many, many variables.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.976" offset="7973543">I think that in habeas corpus cases, where you are defining what is a fact issue by 2254(d), which then goes back to Townsend v. Sain, and where you're looking at how much you're going to give to the State courts to do without independent Federal review there, I think all... in all of the situations where you're looking at juror bias or that kind of thing, you are saying mixed questions of fact and law are subject to de novo review by a Federal district court in habeas corpus, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.411" offset="8083361">That's one situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.453" offset="8087437">But the other situation, even though it's the same type of issue, I submit has been resolved differently by this Court, that the criterion that the Court has used is, who's in the best position to decide the question, and is the decision going to be of precedential significance, because as long as you're going to have three judges spend their time trying to scratch their heads and decide whether the court was right or not in close cases, you ought to at least be getting something for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.381" offset="8203211">And I would suggest also that we are talking about the close cases by definition, since it's only in the cases where two permissible results could be the outcome that there's a difference between the de novo standard and the clearly erroneous standard, so it's hard to see how you're going to get very many precedents coming out of just those close cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.330" offset="10151006">But I think that the development of these labels has come to the point where these concepts have enough meaning that when you've got the development of the law to the point where probable cause and reasonable suspicion have, and you see that it's a fact-bound area that resists specific rules, that it's appropriate specifically to tell the courts of appeals that this is an area where we think that the district courts are in the better position, and we don't think that in most cases you're going to have much precedential significance to drawing the line in these close cases one way or the other because these situations are not going to arise exactly the same way again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.823" offset="10408991">Well, I think that... I think there's some truth to that, particularly when you go back to cases as far as Brineger and before you had the history that led up through Aguilar and Spinelli to Illinois v. Gates, where I think there may have been a recognition that the probable cause and reasonable suspicion determinations were really not susceptible of the kind of precedential significance that I think in Brineger the majority of the Court found, and in that case, it was different from that, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.509" offset="10511704">In that case, they lined up the facts in Carroll, and they lined up the facts in Brineger, and they said, unless we're going to say that this is for the trial court to decide, we can't distinguish these, and therefore we must reverse, and Justice Jackson in dissent made the very point that I'm frankly arguing for today, which is that the difference is that we only said in Carroll that it was permissible to make this finding, and I think that's a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.104" offset="10602088">In this case, I would affirm because it's permissible, but you didn't have to find it, and I think that that dissent was very prescient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.180" offset="10638346">I think that it picked up the theme that later drove the Court's decision in Illinois v. Gates to reject Aguilar and Spinelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.933" offset="10665409">So I think that the law has progressed somewhat, in that I think there is something useful to be said to the courts of appeals and in response, I believe to Justice Kennedy, there was a question, I believe whether the Court should take into account deficiencies that a clearly erroneous rule would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.657" offset="10740328">I would suggest that certainly that that would not be a justification in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.201" offset="10758509">I would suggest that where the district court is in a better position to decide the question and the courts of appeals are not really making precedent, that it's certainly not unreasonable to give the guidance to say, look, you don't have to try to make these fine distinctions on appeal, particularly since you weren't there to raise what additional questions might have come to mind like, how loose was the panel, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.520" offset="12703796">As a practical matter, that's precisely what has been going on, and I think the resultant effect is that there is no continuity in decisions, and there's a disparity in these decisions and the application of Fourth Amendment principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.619" offset="12748099">More importantly, it was posed by counsel that perhaps this should be an opportunity for the Court to more clearly define the definition of clearly erroneous, as was announced in Bessemer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.326" offset="12798986">I don't believe that there is any more workable standard by which to determine when something is clearly erroneous or is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.932" offset="12829392">There's no way to quantify by setting a certain specific value, and basically what it comes down to is a court of appeal judge saying, I think this is clearly erroneous, and I think it's a totally subjective standard, and I think it's unworkable in the sense of saying we should leave it on an ad hoc basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.253" offset="12898669">Counsel also alludes to the principles enunciated in Gates v. Illinois, and it is our position as petitioners that to accord the clearly erroneous standard in warrantless Fourth Amendment cases would be inconsistent with the principles of Gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.333" offset="12958960">In Gates, obviously the Court, citing Ventresca, was trying to encourage police officers, the front line law enforcement individuals, to rely on the warrant.</text>
