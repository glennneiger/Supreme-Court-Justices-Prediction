            <text syncTime="174.086" offset="842679">Our suggestion as to what should happen in a situation, it's clear under this Court's decision in Ball that the prosecutor is entitled to charge both, to present evidence as to both, to put both before the jury, and the Court is entitled to accept a verdict back from the jury with respect to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.386" offset="919897">If the jury comes back and enters guilty verdicts with respect to both, our position is that it would be incumbent upon the district court to enter a vacatur with respect to one or the other in that court's discretion, and then when the entire case goes up on appeal, and we would assume that the defendant, having been found guilty, would take an appeal, both the guilty verdict, the judgment entered upon the conviction... for instance, the CCE... and the vacatur that the district court entered on the conspiracy would be before the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.012" offset="1074333">It would be incumbent upon the defendant to argue with respect to both of those counts everything that he has, because the appellate court, having jurisdiction over the entire case and all the orders therein because the appeal is from a final appeal, if it determined that the CCE count should be reversed based on some element of CCE or some aspect of the case pertaining to an element that distinguishes it from the underlying conspiracy, the appellate court would have the authority to reverse the vacatur on double jeopardy grounds at the same time.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.729" offset="1417268">--Well, I reject that because the Second Circuit's approach involves entering judgments of conviction on two counts when we believe under the Ball decision that judgments of conviction should be entered under only one of the counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.432" offset="1492083">That, we believe, is Congress' intent, and that, we believe, is backed up by the force of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.356" offset="13343734">--Well, under this Court's per curiam decision in Ray, there really are no longer concurrent sentences in the Federal system, because each judgment of conviction carries with it a separate $50 assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.128" offset="13482810">With respect to Jeffers, while the Court was willing to assume for that cases the status of the conspiracy as a lesser included, what it did not assume, and the question it specifically answered was, would it call the critical inquiry whether Congress intended to punish these two statutes separately, and the answer there was no, and that answer was not only shared by the four members of the plurality, but I believe my reading, if you look at footnote 5 of Justice Stevens' concurrence, he said there were two punishments imposed unconstitutionally as well, so eight justices there, regardless of the lesser included issue, said specifically Congress did not intend to punish violations of 846 and 848 separately.</text>
