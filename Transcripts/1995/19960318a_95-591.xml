            <text syncTime="10.429" offset="169523">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.540" offset="181958">The issue in this case is whether section 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code runs afoul of the Export Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.804" offset="214976">Section 4371 imposes a generally applicable tax not limited to exports on premiums paid by foreign insurers for risks that occur wholly or partly within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.552" offset="258026">It eliminates a competitive advantage that foreign insurers would otherwise enjoy by virtue of their exemption from the Federal income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.967" offset="287597">The Federal Circuit ruled that the Export Clause prohibits the application of that tax to insurance associated with exports.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.681" offset="318526">They concluded that this Court's decision in Thames &amp; Mersey v. United States compelled that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.676" offset="342454">We submit that this Court's ruling in Thames &amp; Mersey is no longer viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.860" offset="359172">That decision was a departure from precedent when it was decided 80 years ago, and it rested on a Commerce-Clause rationale this Court has since repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.924" offset="391460">But perhaps most important, Thames cannot be reconciled with this Court's modern tax decisions, which have worked a basic change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.610" offset="422180">Those decisions, Michelin Tire and Washington Stevedoring, have, in the words of the Court, abandoned the past practice of examining when goods lose their character as imports or exports, and has refocused the inquiry on the nature of the tax at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.240" offset="480694">Using that approach, the Court has concluded that the Import-Export Clause does not prohibit the application of generally applicable taxes, but rather prohibits--</text>

            <text syncTime="157.613" offset="758219">We certainly have the precedents out there, and I just... you're going to have to persuade me that there are some very important reasons for overturning these longstanding precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.882" offset="807329">And this is a separate provisions, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.943" offset="815584">It's not as if it's based on the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.505" offset="825824">It's based on a separate prohibition against taxes on imports, on exports, which is... the language is different even in the Export-Import Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.882" offset="859261">Your Honor, I'd like to answer both of the questions, both of the points that you made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.273" offset="876919">First, this Court has consistently interpreted the Export Clause and the Import-Export Clause as imposing a parallel limitation on the Federal and State Governments with respect to exports.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.740" offset="914745">If there's one element of consistency that has run through this Court's cases in the past 175 years, it is that those two clauses should be interpreted consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.126" offset="952256">And secondly, there is a question of the language difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.918" offset="963437">Respondent asserts that the Export Clause should be read as a more extensive prohibition because it uses the term, tax or duty, rather than the term, impost or duty, but the terms tax and impost are synonymous, and the operative phrase in this context is functionally identical.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="225.268" stopTime="228.550">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="225.268" offset="1028848">Well, why are they synonymous?</text>
            <text syncTime="226.430" offset="1033550">Why did the Framers use different language, then?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="228.550" offset="1042013">The Framers frequently used synonymous terms to express the same idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.034" offset="1055910">For example, the Framers stated that Congress would have the power to raise and support armies, but also to provide and maintain a Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.390" offset="1093318">It said that Congress would have the power to establish post offices, but to constitute tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.865" offset="1119231">The very nature of a synonym is, frequently it can be used interchangeably with no change in meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.637" offset="1138353">Well, I don't think that carries you very... to provide and maintain a Navy, you're providing ships, whereas to raise and support armies, you're conscripting troops.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="263.597" offset="1182134">But this... the overall content of those phrases, they convey the same general meaning, and that's the point that Chief Justice Marshall made in 1827 in the case of Brown v. Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.729" offset="1218705">As he stated, there is some diversity in language, but the act that is prohibited is the same, and that provision, that statement has been followed by this Court, as I say, in numerous cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.080" offset="1280145">It's true that the aspect of the case originally... relating to the original package doctrine has not been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.475" offset="1305641">At least it has not been seen as a restriction, but one of the ironies of this case is that what the respondent's position would do is actually reintroduce the very notion of the original package doctrine, or at least the converse of it in the sense of taxes on exports.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.871" offset="5839244">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.856" offset="5871218">The holding of Michelin and Washington Stevedoring which the Government is relying on so heavily in this case is that impost did not mean tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.514" offset="5913850">The key holding in Michelin was that impost referred to a subcategory of taxes, those taxes which are of a customs nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.811" offset="5951048">Those are the cases the Government's relying upon, and now they're turning the rationale of that case inside-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.842" offset="5975185">Impost and tax in some instances are used synonymously, but rarely, and certainly the jurisprudence under these clauses has been absolutely to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.453" offset="6029625">Absolutely... I mean, you have John Marshall, for starters, as saying that the two clauses mean the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.157" offset="6052403">--Not on this point, Justice Scalia, and I think this is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.527" offset="6069853">I think the Government has put together in a way that ends up being misleading two different things that John Marshall said, Chief Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.054" offset="6099946">In the... where he said the clauses are similar, he was addressing the issue of whether a tax imposed on an occupation is a tax on an import, and it was in that context that he drew an analogy to the Export Clause and said both clauses are similar in that they use similar language as to what's prohibited, what act is prohibited the laying on of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.188" offset="6184583">That's where he said the clauses were similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.270" offset="6192838">Separately, eight pages earlier, he addressed the difference between tax and imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.512" offset="6213840">Justice Thompson... you may remember the Senate in that case saying the Maryland tax was a tax, not an impost, and therefore was outside the scope of the Import-Export Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.669" offset="6254487">Marshall rejected that argument and concluded there, to quote the Government's reply brief on page 12, the Court concluded that the term impost is not used in a narrow or fixed manner, but generally signifies a tax levied on articles brought into the country, so we agree with Marshall's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.962" offset="6327630">I think his statement is consistent with Michelin that in the context of these clauses, impost had a rather specific meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.234" offset="6352707">Thames &amp; Mersey was not a departure from existing law at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.132" offset="6384263">The Court's decisions on the Export Clause have been perfectly consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.542" offset="6401922">They have said from the beginning that Federal taxes may not be applied to the export process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.406" offset="6425432">They've also said that if the export journey has not begun, such as in a manufacturing tax, then the issue of discrimination is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.543" offset="6469945">But all of the cases, starting with Turpin v. Burgess, have said that you can... the Federal Government cannot tax the export process itself, and Thames &amp; Mersey is squarely within that line of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.083" offset="6516129">Now, concerning the questions, I guess Justice Kennedy raised and perhaps Justice Ginsburg, as to whether this is sufficiently indirect that it's not a tax on exports, the record doesn't reveal the sort of statistical information Justice Breyer was suggesting might be relevant because the Government has conceded throughout that they are not disputing that this tax, if discriminatory, is in violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.770" offset="6622813">They are not challenging that aspect of Thames &amp; Mersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.031" offset="6631904">They haven't challenged it throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.291" offset="6636919">To do so, they would have to challenge not just Thames &amp; Mersey, they'd have to go back and challenge Chief Justice Marshall's holding in Brown v. Maryland that a tax on occupation is a tax on an import, they'd have to challenge the Fairbank decision, which they've embraced throughout their briefs, which involved a indirect tax, they'd have to challenge Hvoslef, they'd have to challenge Thames &amp; Mersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.285" offset="6720929">And the reality is that a tax on insurance is very... is about as close as you can come to an ad valorem tax on the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2051.402" offset="8333416">And at the Constitution, there was... there were strong, compelling reasons advanced and fought over very hard as to whether or not exports should be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.387" offset="8373331">It was one of the closest votes at the Constitutional Convention, and there were several reasons to coalesce behind this tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.342" offset="8401125">One was the concern of the southern States that were dependent upon the export economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.797" offset="8418993">There were also those from New England that thought an export exemption would benefit domestic industries, would encourage the development of domestic industries, and there were others that were simply concerned about the scope of taxing authority being given to the United States, which, of course, was happening now the first time at the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.907" offset="8487434">That came together to result in a tax exemption, which is clearly written and was intended by the Framers to be very broad, and there's no contemporary evidence from that Constitutional Convention that impost was intended to be synonymous with tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.883" offset="8771332">The Court read those terms to mean taxes that tax imports and exports, qua imports and exports that are focused on, that discriminated against them as opposed to general taxes, so that's how there is a respectable, indeed, perhaps strong constitutional basis to limit the Import-Export Clause to discriminatory taxes.</text>
