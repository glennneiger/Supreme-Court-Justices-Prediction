            <text syncTime="41.041" offset="304608">There was no dispute in any of the judicial opinions below about the proposition that the official ERISA plan documents did not provide for vested or lifetime welfare benefits, and there was a ruling, from which certiorari has not been sought from counsel for the plaintiffs in this case, that there was no entitlement to benefits in this case under section 502(a)(1)(B), the benefits section of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.024" offset="412546">The questions before this Court, then, are not whether benefits were due, or whether ERISA was violated because in some way there were improper misrepresentations made about plan documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.758" offset="5751453">But if they mislead, and they then mislead about the participation in the plan, the solvency of the plan, the future of the plan, and so forth, it seems to me the very fact that they're misleading helps us to determine which hat that they're wearing, because the employee has the justified expectation that he or she will receive accurate information about the plan whenever the fiduciary talks, no matter what his hat is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.196" offset="5881229">There is no claim here that they received inaccurate information about the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.500" offset="5898365">The brief amicus curiae of the United States, for example, makes very clear, and very honorably, although we disagree wich them, that the one statement made to the individuals about the plan was true, that the plan would be the same after, as it was before, that there would be no changes in the plan terms after as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.329" offset="5981748">All the allegations of falseness and of false statements, every single one of them, relates not to statements about the plan, but as to why you should join the new company, and the good qualities of the new company, and looking forward to a bright future, et cetera, and that is indeed one of the reasons why we maintain that this is not plan administration, whatever plan administration is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.156" offset="6156977">And if these statements were made about the new corporation and its rosy future and so on for the purpose, or in part for the purpose of causing this exodus out of the old plan and the reduction of the old plan's liabilities, why doesn't that fit within a concept of administrative purpose?</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.113" offset="11296831">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.187" offset="11341134">First, just to put in context the nature of the fiduciary breach claim here, we think it is precisely as Justice Souter stated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.543" offset="11378542">The statement that plan benefits will remain unchanged might have accurately described the plan on paper, but a plan in the real world consists of more than just the paper the document is written on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.351" offset="11421800">It consists of the funds that will be available to pay the benefits, and in this case it's the same, analytically, as if the welfare benefits were paid out of a separate corpus, and it would take 50 million dollars to fund the benefits, but the employer had only put 1,000 into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.396" offset="11494003">If the employer said, your benefits will remain unchanged, and the plan looked the same on paper, that would not be a fully accurate description to the employees who were being induced to leave a secure plan to go to an unsecure plan to say that their benefits have remained unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.589" offset="11554711">So this was quite clearly a representation about the current status of the benefit plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.126" offset="11576863">The point is whether it is not undertaken, whether it is of interest to people who were in the plan, whether it would affect their actions in the plan, the issue is whether it... the representation is made in the administration of the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.971" offset="11644259">I was simply trying to describe what the nature of the misrepresentation was, but by the same token, when an employer wearing two hats is asked to describe what the employees' benefits will be under the current plan, this is not a statement of an intent to amend the plan in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.197" offset="11705177">This is a statement of what employees' benefits are or will be under the current plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.803" offset="11739658">In that situation we think it's quite clear that the employer is speaking in a fiduciary capacity, or at least would be understood by the reasonable employees in a meeting such as this, where the employer through all of the communications constantly referred to the benefit consequences of the switch, that the employer... employees were being spoken to about their benefits, which is after all a classic administrator responsibility under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.435" offset="11838192">It is the administrator of the plan that is responsible for disclosing documents to plan participants, these summary plan description and notice of material modifications, so that the employees would have been used to, and in fact in this case did receive their communications about plan benefits--</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.304" offset="13813572">I'd like to return to Justice O'Connor's observation earlier, when you said that it looked a lot like damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.379" offset="13853905">It's perfectly true that we have not put at issue here, and it's not before the Court whether this is equitable relief or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.033" offset="13876579">The district court basically gave the class a choice of either taking a lump sum in damages for everything, or reinstatement and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.821" offset="13915658">It looks a lot to us... and both of them look a lot to us like benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.875" offset="13935929">It is the award of benefits, and that... and it is instinct in that award of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.796" offset="13967590">That's what they'll be getting if we lose this case, is that there's at least a potential conflict with subpart (1), or at least an overlap with subpart (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.485" offset="14006355">We think subpart (1) is supposed to deal with benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.354" offset="14017849">We think that there is a clarity to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.139" offset="14028925">Sure, there's some overlap, but this Court has praised Congress occasionally for crafting this with special care and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.376" offset="14057869">Subpart (1) is the benefit section, and it is the case that if we lose here that, in the ordinary course, any well-advised plaintiff will sue under subpart (1) and (3), under (1) for saying, I didn't get benefits, under (3) for saying, you breached your fiduciary obligations in not awarding me benefits, and we think that's not an appropriate way to interpret what Congress meant, nor do we think it's appropriate to interpret the breadth of section 409 in such a narrow way as has been suggested today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.133" offset="14192974">I read, in conclusion, the first line of section 409(a), any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities obligations, or duties, et cetera, as the start of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.773" offset="14239472">We think that section 409 was Congress' effort to deal with</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.058" offset="14260684">"liability for breach of fiduciary duty. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.760" offset="14271446">and unless this Court is to revisit Russell... and we understand full well Russell doesn't govern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.331" offset="14293702">You said it didn't govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.533" offset="14298509">But unless you are to revisit Russell, it is the logic, it is the sense of Russell, and of 409, and of the statute as comprehensively viewed, that there cannot be recovery here.</text>
