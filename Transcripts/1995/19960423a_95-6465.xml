            <text syncTime="18.023" offset="199170">By requiring jury trials in all criminal prosecutions, the Framers made a lasting statement about the structure of Government and the balance of political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.150" offset="231771">In cases where the threat to liberty is dire, the power to convict does not belong to the State, it belongs to the people themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.756" offset="266148">The Framers regarded the jury trial as such a potent instrument against Government oppression that they included the guarantee in the Constitution not once, but twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.262" offset="304183">These bedrock political values, the plain language of the Sixth Amendment guarantee, and this Court's decisions construing the Sixth Amendment, all point toward a single conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.809" offset="350367">My client, who faced 1 year in prison on the two counts in which he was tried, was entitled to a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.851" offset="406478">So if we accept your view in order to make anything but sort of a farcical rule we would have to, I suppose, have a rule of compulsory joinder.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.378" offset="452663">I disagree with that, with all respect, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.750" offset="462171">The reason is that in the first place it strikes us as very unlikely that the Government would seek to sever counts in order to circumvent this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.897" offset="502713">The reason is that... for that is that the Government derives a benefit from joining counts, and has every incentive to join them and not to sever them.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.792" offset="542315">I mean, it may get a benefit if the evidence, in fact, is common to all of the counts, or all of the separate indictments, but if the Government really wants somebody to do the maximum amount of hard time, I suppose even under the guidelines there's some reason to believe the total will be greater if they're tried separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.067" offset="627370">So the Government might be under conflicting motivations and it might in some cases decide to sever, and I would suppose if it does, unless we have a compulsory joinder rule, then the rule that you argue for is not going to be of any practical effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="145.669" offset="709812">I think that the value to the prosecution of joining counts would outweigh those concerns, because the Government would get not only the administrative convenience of a single proceeding, but it also does derive a tactical advantage from joining the counts in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.021" offset="775223">The finder of fact gets to hear evidence that the defendant is, in essence, a worse defendant, because he or she has committed more than one offense, and there's also the possibility of some sort of spillover that might bolster some of the weaker counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.097" offset="975530">I mean, can the prosecution, by making that commitment and the judge, by saying at the outset, I... it is understood that whatever... eve if the defendant is found guilty he will not be sentenced by more than 6 months, can you eliminate the jury trial by doing just that?</text>

            <text syncTime="283.141" offset="1259637">Once a case is serious, it is serious in the same away, regardless of whether it is serious by virtue of aggregation or serious because of the authorized penalty on a single--</text>

            <text syncTime="305.486" offset="1349081">Even if the judge promises a lenient sentence as a result, in order to extinguish the jury trial, the defendant is still left with the possibility of the conviction on more than one count, which itself carries not only a stigma but other collateral consequences, and indeed, it appears that the core of the jury-trial right was protection against the conviction power, and that there was less concern per se about the sentencing power.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.884" offset="2430655">Indeed, it is the same judgment that goes into authorizing a... the particular penalty for any single offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.374" offset="4740610">When they are tried separately, they do not, because if each individual trial on a single petty offense falls outside of the Sixth Amendment, then any individual one does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.082" offset="4787422">Moving back to the pretrial sentencing stipulation again, there is a secondary reason besides the policy behind the Sixth Amendment that I think indicates that such a stipulation procedure should not be authorized in this case, and the reason is that it is inconsistent with this Court's decisions that have refused to hold that the sentence actually imposed can deprive someone of a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.961" offset="4899017">The relevant question is, and always has been, whether a serious sentence was authorized by the legislature, and the Court has consistently held that a judge cannot trump that view of seriousness, and in fact the Court has had many opportunities to look at this rule and has never changed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.902" offset="6134713">In our view, any case involving only offenses that Congress has defined as petty may be tried without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.529" offset="6165224">Petitioner has no right to a trial by jury because both of the offenses in this case were defined by Congress as petty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.923" offset="6190824">Petitioner acknowledges that the United States could have charged him with the same offenses in two separate informations and tried him without a jury in two separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.209" offset="6227918">In fact, he could have been tried in separate seriatim trials before the same judge on the same day, and he could have been sentenced to a total of a year in prison in the two proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.424" offset="6268774">In petitioner's view, he would have had no jury right in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.529" offset="6285283">The petty character of obstruction of the mails is unchanged by the prosecutor's decision in this case to try the two counts together.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.426" offset="6396878">The petty offense exclusion has already made clear that criminal prosecutions exclude prosecutions of petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.012" offset="6427180">Moreover, this Court in Callan v. Wilson specified that the Sixth Amendment did not expand the jury right as articulated in Article III of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.909" offset="6470753">Article III refers not to prosecutions, but to crimes, and this Court's cases have made clear that crimes, as specified in Article III, and the criminal prosecutions as specified in the Sixth Amendment, are limited to serious crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.708" offset="6529998">Therefore, petitioner's argument reduces to arguing that serious offense prosecutions are covered by the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.964" offset="6558942">It doesn't support the weight he tries to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.916" offset="6570749">Under the petitioner's theory, the criminal prosecution theory also makes no sense, because under his theory an individual charged with two petty crimes that are tried separately but who faces the same total year consequence would be treated differently from an individual who is charged with those two petty offenses in one--</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.256" offset="7632157">Now, if that's the mind set that was supposed to bring to jury trial the Seventh Amendment, why shouldn't it be the same in the Sixth Amendment, and you say well, you could argue it as the prosecution is the unit, you could argue it as the crime is the unit, but in view of the importance of jury trial, you take the prosecution as the unit, and if the two add up to more than 6 months, you get a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.819" offset="7774367">But I think the broader point, whether the importance of the jury right requires a jury right here, is clearly refuted by the common law antecedents of the jury right, that those were the antecedents that the Framers had in mind in excluding the petty offenses from the coverage of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.974" offset="7859004">The Court's categorical distinction between petty and serious offenses derives from the common law practice of trying petty offenses to juries.</text>
