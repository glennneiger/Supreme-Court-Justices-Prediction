            <text syncTime="3157.599" offset="12768353">On the one hand, we've got the case of statutory construction, construction of agency regs, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.347" offset="12879425">At the other extreme, you've got the question of contract construction, and as you pointed out, one of the issues in contract construction may well be an issue of subjective intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.916" offset="12921639">What did these people or one of them have in mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.627" offset="12932506">So, that makes it a classic kind of evidentiary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.191" offset="12954762">And you said, well, here in a patent claim, we don't have an issue of subjective intent simply because the objects of stating patent claims rule out that as a legitimate consideration, and I will accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.542" offset="13028114">But isn't... and here is where I get to my question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.415" offset="13035637">Isn't it also the case that the terms that are supposed to be used in these claims are terms which have meaning within the art in question?</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.321" offset="13079314">So, therefore, the matter of meaning is something for which we can legitimately look outside the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.316" offset="13111288">And isn't there a strong analogy between looking for the understanding of the art or the trade, something outside the document, and looking for the subjective intent of parties, which is also outside the document?</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.159" offset="13178580">The evidence bearing on them may be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.062" offset="13194253">But isn't the fact finder engaging in essentially the same kind fact finding?</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.126" offset="13226540">In one case he's saying contracts, what did they specifically have in mind here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.770" offset="13249110">In the other case, he's saying, what does this whole body of people mean by this term?</text>
