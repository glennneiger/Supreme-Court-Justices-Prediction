            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="81804">The Chief Justice is attending a judicial conference and will not be with us this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.319" offset="106986">Justice Breyer has an opinion to announce.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="12.329" stopTime="433.633">
            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="12.329" offset="131019">This is the opinion in Denver Area Educational Telecommunications versus FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.261" offset="154842">These cases, there are two of them, involve First Amendment challenges to three sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.458" offset="199564">The first section, Section 10(a) applies to leased access channels that are about 10-15% of the channels, say, on an 80-channel system maybe 12 channels, federal law requires cable operators to reserve for commercial lease those channels that can be leased or happen to lease by affiliated party.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.692" offset="292560">The provision permits the cable system operator to control either to allow or to prohibit programming that the operator reasonably believes detect sexual activity or organs in a patently offensive manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.672" offset="352433">That is the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.213" offset="358597">The second one, 10(b) also applies only to this leased access channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.347" offset="383153">It requires cable system operators to segregate this patently offensive programming from all the other programming that is run on leased channels and then to have it broadcast on a single channel and then have it blocked so that viewers to get access have to write in up to 30 days in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.031" offset="461833">There is a third section and the third section is just like the first, that it gives the cable operators control over patently offensive material that this is the material that would be run not on leased access channels but on what are called public or educational or governmental channels which is another set of channels best known as education.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.387" offset="543335">Now, the Circuit Court of Appeal to the District of Columbia held that all three of those provisions were constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.477" offset="583668">In this opinion, and in the holdings today, we say that two of the three provisions violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.526" offset="615851">The third one does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.017" offset="625778">Now let me begin with Section 10(a), that is the one that we hold is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.297" offset="646989">It does not violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.645" offset="656289">That is the one that permitted the cable system operator himself to control the patently offensive programming on leased channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.180" offset="702473">Now in an opinion, in which I am joined by Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor, and Justice Souter, the four of us find that the provision has an important indeed a compelling regulatory objective namely protecting children from the broadcast of patently offensive sexual material.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.489" offset="791708">A broadcast television program, unlike the individual telephone conversations that were at issue in a different case called Sable Communications, here this broadcast is in pervasive, it is intrusive, and children are often in the audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.201" offset="862552">The opinion also finds that the regulation is properly tailored to meet this child protecting objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.375" offset="891286">It is permissive, allowing operator’s latitude to avoid harming children without necessarily banning the program, it will apply to a relatively narrow category of material which we discussed, and to a degree it reflects a First Amendment interest of the cable operators themselves in return to those cable operator a form of editorial control that the operators had enjoyed in respect to those channels 10 years earlier before Congress had taken that power away from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.946" offset="1029526">These and other factors make the First Amendment balance complex with no precise analogy in this Court’s earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.877" offset="1065262">Nonetheless, the opinion draws support from Pacifica, a case involving the broadcast of offensive material to children which case upheld the regulation that was likely more or certainly no less restrictive that the regulation at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.805" offset="1141017">The court holds that the second provision, Section 10(b) requiring the blocking and segregating of offensive material.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.057" offset="1173931">We hold that that provision violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.520" offset="1191799">The opinion is for the court in this respect, in respect to this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.274" offset="1210816">It finds the provision more restrictive that 10(a), a viewer could not watch a scrambled program for example without considerable perhaps 30 days advance planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.044" offset="1249895">Program as of individual programs could not reach viewers who tending to think that programs are judged by the company they keep just would not want watch that patently offensive channel and viewers might here being listed as people who want patently offensive programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.399" offset="1311335">We recognize that the justification, the protection of children, is compelling but there are obvious significantly less restrictive alternatives including alternatives more recently adapted in the 1996 Telecommunications Act which apply to all and not just leased channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.368" offset="1387195">We also hold unconstitutional the third provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.593" offset="1404122">Section 10(c) which permits cable system operators to allow or to prohibit patently offensive programming on public, educational, and governmental channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.837" offset="1449053">The opinion, with respect to this provision in which justice Stevens and Justice Souter only have joined, recognizes that this provision looks identical to the first one applying to leased channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.408" offset="1507358">But the record reveals several critically important differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.603" offset="1524181">Cable operators have not historically exercised editorial control over these channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.966" offset="1549572">For reasons that we point out, the First Amendment risks were measured against the regulation’s ability to protect children are far greater and the need for the provision is significantly less.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.106" offset="1598160">We conclude that the government has not shown a patently offensive programming problem on these channels great enough to justify the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.925" offset="1637448">To repeat, we hold that Section 10(a) is constitutional and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.282" offset="1670885">We hold that Section 10(b) and Section (c) are not, and reverse the Court of Appeals with respect to those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.332" offset="1699097">The opinion speaks for the Court with respect to 10(b) only not for 10(a) or 10(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="410.338" offset="1723130">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion; Justice O’Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part; Justice Kennedy joined by Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part; Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion, and Justice Thomas joined by Chief Justice and Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</text>
