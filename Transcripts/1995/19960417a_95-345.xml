            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="164017">We'll hear argument now in Number 95-345, United States v. Guy Jerome Ursery, and Number 95-346, United States v. $405,000 and some change, consolidated for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.002" offset="236010">Mr. Dreeben.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="19.344" stopTime="149.069">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="19.344" offset="241339">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.065" offset="252206">From the earliest years of this Nation, Congress has authorized the Government to seek parallel in rem civil forfeiture actions and criminal prosecutions based on the same underlying events.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.734" offset="306855">Until recently, the pursuit of such parallel actions was deemed to raise no question under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.600" offset="338410">Two recent decisions of this Court, however, United States v. Halper and Austin v. United States, prompted the courts of appeals in these two cases to conclude that the cumulative remedies of in rem civil forfeiture and criminal prosecution violated the multiple punishments doctrine under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.553" offset="418136">These holdings are incompatible with the long tradition and practice in this country, and are incorrect for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="448334">First, civil forfeiture is not categorically punitive within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, and the forfeitures in this case were not punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.134" offset="488458">Second, an in rem forfeiture action is not a jeopardy that can give rise to the protection of the Fifth Amendment when the Government seeks to prosecute the owner of the forfeited property for a criminal violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.524" offset="546032">Third, civil forfeiture of property under 21 U.S.C. 881 is not the same offense as the criminal prosecution of the owner of the property for having violated the narcotics laws and, finally, parallel contemporaneous civil forfeiture actions and criminal prosecutions shall be deemed to constitute a single proceeding within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and therefore not to violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.413" offset="657627">Now, the overriding question that is presented in both of these cases and in many others that are being litigated in the lower courts is whether in rem civil forfeiture should be deemed to be punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.720" offset="710812">Both of the courts below adopted a categorical rule that the forfeiture that is accomplished by application of section 881 should be categorically deemed punishment.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="149.069" offset="760236">Now, do you think, Mr. Dreeben, that the civil forfeiture could be punitive for purposes of the Excessive Fines Clause and yet not multiple punishment within the meaning of double jeopardy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="165.438" stopTime="240.488">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="165.438" offset="825751">Yes, Justice O'Connor, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.421" offset="833692">The question that this Court has considered in determining whether civil forfeitures should be subjected to analysis under the Excessive Fines Clause is really an issue of whether it is sufficiently punitive to trigger the threshold applicability of that clause, and this Court held in the Austin decision that civil forfeiture does have such a punitive component both historically and in its contemporary applications, but civil forfeiture has never been deemed so punitive when considered in light of its simultaneous remedial aims as to constitute either a prosecution or a punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and we submit that that is the correct analysis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.027" offset="1004115">In Halper itself, the Court applied a case by case analysis to determine whether a particular sanction applied in a particular case constituted an impermissible punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.755" offset="1051031">The Court's conclusion in Austin that categorically civil forfeiture warrants analysis under the Eighth Amendment does not dictate that all civil forfeitures applied in all cases at all times should be deemed punishment with the rather radical consequences that were accomplished by the courts below.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="240.488" stopTime="248.362">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="240.488" offset="1125950">So you think Halper maybe could be viewed as a multiple prosecution case and not a multiple punishment case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="248.362" stopTime="281.744">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="248.362" offset="1157401">I think that Halper, analyzed in the terms that the Court analyzed it, was a multiple punishments case, but it is nonetheless true that under Halper, there is some confusion about the exact test that the Court adopted in that case due to different formulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.434" offset="1221663">But our reading of Halper is that a sanction that is rationally related and can be explained by reference to underlying remedial purposes is not to be deemed punishment for purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause even if there may be some element of punishment associated with that sanction.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="281.744" offset="1290939">And even though it's considered such for purposes of the Excessive Fines Clause?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="287.959" offset="1315808">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.210" offset="1316853">I can't understand why somebody who would write a Constitution would think that a punishment is a punishment for one purpose but not another.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.156" offset="1352588">I mean, if it's punishment enough that you can't make it excessive, why isn't it punishment enough that you shouldn't get it twice?</text>
            <text syncTime="304.560" offset="1382159">What policy reason is there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="306.333" stopTime="345.268">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="306.333" offset="1389264">The answer to that question goes in part back to the roots and origins of the Double Jeopardy Clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.585" offset="1418313">That clause was an embodiment of common law protections that were accorded to finality in a criminal judgment, and they were accorded to the criminal judgment in very specific contexts that this Court has developed over time in a series of rather intricate and complicated rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.478" offset="1485917">It has never been the case, though, that the pursuit of an in rem action against property and the criminal prosecution of the owner of the property for separate violations would be deemed to constitute an impermissible multiple punishment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="345.268" stopTime="370.313">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="345.268" offset="1545059">But you're saying... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.858" offset="1551433">I say, I suggest that's only because it was never applied to multiple punishments, period, of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.541" offset="1574107">I mean, greater includes the lesser, to be sure, but once we are on the track that double punishment, as opposed to double jeopardy, is covered by the Double Jeopardy Clause, I don't see why all punishment deemed punishment by the Constitution shouldn't qualify.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="370.313" stopTime="418.064">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="370.313" offset="1645264">Well, I think the answer, Justice Scalia, is that to the extent that there is protection against multiple punishments that has been recognized in this Court's cases as subsumed by the Fifth Amendment, that protection has been limited and defined in very specific contexts, and has never been a freestanding doctrine that would invalidate any and all simultaneous or contemporaneous pursuit of two actions that had some punitive component to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.718" offset="1746828">And what the courts below did, I think, is take to the absolute logical limits the principle that was in part reflected in Halper, recognizing a prohibition against multiple punishments, and have taken that principle and extended it so that it overrides very familiar common law practices that were well known to the Framers and that have been reflected throughout the history of this country--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="418.064" offset="1836272">But isn't the different with, or at least a difficulty with the historical argument that you're making that some of the forfeiture in this case, or in these cases, just do not have common law pedigrees?</text>
            <text syncTime="430.723" offset="1886845">It's one thing, for example, perhaps to forfeit a vehicle on the theory that it stands in the same, or is in the same position of, you know, the boat that was used for smuggling and so on?</text>
            <text syncTime="443.860" offset="1939403">It seems to me quite another thing, though, to apply that same rule and to invoke history to apply the same rule when we're talking about the forfeiture of all equity in a house that was used to dry some marijuana, and so I don't see how your historical argument, even if I accepted it, could get you all the way through these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.806" offset="2027175">--I agree, Justice Souter, that history is not the entire answer to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.190" offset="2044729">To take, for example, the issue of proceeds forfeitures, which are authorized under title 21 and were not part of the common law of forfeiture, we are not claiming here that the historical pedigree of forfeiting the proceeds of crimes is what explains why that forfeiture is not punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.762" offset="2122992">It's our submission that, analyzed as a matter of reason and logic, and in light of the common law principle that unjust enrichment included gaining funds or moneys through illegal means, and that it was not a punishment to take those profits away from the wrongdoer, we--</text>

            <text syncTime="507.945" offset="2195717">But Mr. Dreeben, if we stick with the house where marijuana was dried, I thought, based on your answer to Justice O'Connor, that you would say that should be treated the way Austin was treated, as an excessive fine case, but doesn't belong... wasn't that the problem in Austin, that what was--</text>

            <text syncTime="526.867" offset="2271472">--Right, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.788" offset="2275129">I think in Austin all forfeitures of facilitating property, property that can be used to facilitate or to commit a crime, are subject to analysis under the Excessive Fines Clause because the Court concluded that they represent some punishment to the owner of the property at least in part, but the Court did not conclude that all forfeitures that are accomplished of facilitating property, or all forfeitures that are carried out under these statutes, will be punitive such that that is the only explanation for the sanction, which is the test in Halper.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.196" offset="2448791">We've got a kind of forfeiture that goes beyond, I think, what the common law knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.152" offset="2472615">Why, in a case like that, should it be punishment for excessiveness purposes or potentially punishment for excessiveness purposes but not for double jeopardy purposes?</text>

            <text syncTime="587.949" offset="2515769">Well, let me first put in the historical context the forfeiture of facilitating property and apply it to the real estate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.027" offset="2548056">The common law recognized in a wide variety of contexts the potential for forfeiting property that was used in the commission of a crime, and your example of boats that were used for importing goods without declaration I think is a salient example.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.135" offset="2608556">There were many, many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.615" offset="2614407">At least since 1868, however, Congress has provided for by statute the forfeiture of real estate that was involved in the commission of crimes particularly with respect to failure to pay tax on liquor.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.587" offset="2678355">Well, that may be, but that doesn't help you out, I think, in a historical argument, which essentially is they understood at the time these clauses were enacted as part of the original Bill of Rights that there could be both these procedures, the criminal prosecution and the forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.918" offset="2739586">Once you get into sort of later statutory amendments, whether its 1878 or 1978, that argument goes, and it seems to me that's the point at which Justice Scalia's question attains a very sharp focus.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.943" offset="6611769">We do not have to prove that that person engaged in a crime or did anything wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.549" offset="6646146">And so to take the facts of this case, where Mr. Ursery and his wife and his son were all coconspirators in manufacturing marijuana, we could have taken the property in our forfeiture action based on his son's activities, without proving anything as to him, and there is therefore no necessary requirement that we prove any culpable action or any state of mind as to the owner of the property in the in rem action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins</label>
            <text syncTime="3346.546" offset="13550100">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.299" offset="13561176">In 1991 and 1992, Guy Jerome Ursery maintained six plots of marijuana plants about 250 to 150 feet outside the premises of his property, a 10-acre home in rural Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.977" offset="13619899">He harvested the plants, processed them, and apparently smoked them in his house, and that was his offense, and for that offense of manufacturing marijuana... which, by the way, does not turn on whether it was on another piece of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.377" offset="13677473">You can take a look at title 21 and you will find that it does not turn in the slightest on the fact that it was on another piece of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.150" offset="13700566">For that offense, he was first subjected to a forfeiture of half the equity in his property under 881(a)(7), the very statute this Court construed in Austin, which permits the forfeiture of property used to commit a narcotics felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.331" offset="13769320">And as the parties were readying themselves for trial in the civil forfeiture, he was then indicted in a single count prosecution, which again charged the manufacture of marijuana, precisely the predicate in the 881(a)(7) forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.880" offset="13827521">This time he was convicted and sentenced to 63 months in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.744" offset="13842985">The Sixth Circuit held that the civil forfeiture under 881(a)(7) was punishment, the prosecution was a second punishment, and it was for the same offense and in a separate proceeding, and accordingly was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause and, in our view, each and every step of that analysis is not only correct, but squarely controlled by this Court's cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.098" offset="14160321">I don't think this Court has had occasion to revisit Various Items and tell us whether it's distinguishable or it's not, but I'm prepared to do so, because it seems to me that what Various Items tells us is that where a forfeiture, as in Various Items, does not turn in the slightest on the innocence of the owner of the property, then, in that event, it's a civil forfeiture which cannot... to which one cannot ascribe a punitive dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.725" offset="14274841">But of course, my statute, 881(a)(7), has an explicit exception for innocent owners which is, of course, the very distinction that this Court in 92 Buena Vista Avenue said makes this statute different from the historical forfeitures, including the one that was at issue in Various Items, the very fact that persuaded this Court in Austin to say that 881(a)(7) is punishment for purposes of the Eighth Amendment, something which at common law I think would have been as surprising to the Framers as some of the hypotheticals suggested by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3626.271" offset="14669081">But apart from that, I think it's also the case, Justice Ginsburg, if I may, that Various Items was decided in an era in which the fiction of in rem proceedings was taken, if I may say so, more seriously, and given a sort of... a treatment that sort of abstracted away from the fact that there is a real person whose property is being taken, and I think frankly Various Items might not come out the same way if viewed in the light of certain of this Court's decisions since then that have said--</text>

            <text syncTime="3668.707" offset="14838773">To me, Bennis is a question of whether the Due Process Clause requires, as a substantive matter, that an owner of property have an innocent owner defense, and the Court, you know, hearkening back to the long line of cases, said that it's not required, but when it's present, surely that's some indication that you have a punitive sanction.</text>
