            <label>Mr. Evan T. Lawson</label>
            <text syncTime="14.512" offset="195815">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="17.173" offset="206473">Price advertizing has always been at the heart of the commercial speech doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.956" offset="229565">Indeed, it was the Court's concern for the free flow of price information that prompted the Court about 20 years ago to overturn the concept that commercial speech had no First Amendment protection and to accord particularly price advertizing protection under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.911" offset="313366">Since that time, the jurisprudence of the Court has developed, and the Central Hudson test has become established and refined.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.856" offset="353176">Application of the Central Hudson test to this case would yield the result that Rhode Island's ban on truthful price advertizing should be found unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.294" offset="402914">Ordinarily, the Central Hudson test seems to be discussed in a sequential fashion, but I would like to turn to the last part of the Central Hudson test, because I think that it is under that part that the defect of this ban is the most clearly apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.277" offset="482848">The last part of the Central Hudson test requires that the State's restriction on speech be no more expansive than is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.185" offset="522554">As this Court has posited it, that means that the restriction not burden speech any more than is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.359" offset="555155">In this particular case, it is clear on the record both from the testimony of the State's own expert, and from the obvious facts of the case that are not disputed, that Rhode Island could accomplish the purpose that it says it wants to accomplish, that is, keeping an artificial price floor for alcoholic beverages simply by setting tax rates or by setting minimum consumer prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.477" offset="731639">What I'm suggesting to the Court is that, where the State has a choice between regulating speech and not regulating speech at all, that it has an obvious alternative that doesn't burden speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.195" offset="838532">The precedent that I would cite for this is the recent Coors decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.965" offset="4785634">This is what the State's expert talked about as the optimum price, and the State's expert conceded that 1) he didn't know what the optimum price would be, and he essentially conceded that he had no way of knowing, and in view of the fact that Rhode Island, with its price ban in effect for almost 40 years, was in the top third in consumption, there was no evidence to show that the State's theory worked.</text>
