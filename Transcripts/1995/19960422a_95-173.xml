            <text syncTime="15.766" offset="204731">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.139" offset="214240">On October 24, 1989, Federal prosecutors in Reno, Nevada commenced a civil forfeiture action against some five and a half million dollars in real and personal property owned by petitioner Brian Degen and his wife, Karen.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.828" offset="276934">As the forfeiture statutes permit, Mr. Degen filed a claim for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.532" offset="295846">In it, he denied that the property was either the proceeds or instrumentalities of narcotics violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.127" offset="322178">He also asserted a range of legal defenses, including that the forfeiture action was time-barred and that it rested on an ex post facto application of the forfeiture laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.513" offset="363765">On the Government's motion, however, the district court struck Mr. Degen's claim for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.956" offset="385499">The court ruled that because Mr. Degen, a dual Swiss and American citizen, had not traveled to the United States to stand trial in a criminal case that had been brought against him, he was a fugitive, and as a fugitive from the criminal case, he was therefore disentitled, in the vernacular, from contesting the civil forfeiture of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.372" offset="475151">The district court therefore entered a judgment against Mr. Degen for the full amount of the Government's claim, some five and a half million dollars of property, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.238" offset="518619">Our central submission this morning is that Federal courts and Federal judges do not have the authority to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.935" offset="549443">To the contrary, this extraordinary application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine cannot be squared with this Court's disentitlement cases, it cannot be squared with due process, and it cannot be squared, most importantly, with the limitations that this Court has always recognized on the scope of the inherent powers of the Federal courts.</text>

Elliott, where the Court, in deciding that a Court lacked the power, said that not even a legislature could pass such a statute, and therefore it's all the more unconstitutional for Federal courts, or in those cases State courts, to exercise that kind of authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.970" offset="5885528">It is undisputed that this civil forfeiture action is directly related to a criminal case that is pending in the same district courthouse against Degen, and that Degen refused to appear to stand trial on the criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.999" offset="5945714">For two reasons, the court of appeals correctly held that a claimant in Degen's situation may be disentitled from contesting the civil forfeiture action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.533" offset="6071833">Our argument starts from the premise that courts always have had the inherent authority to protect against the abuse of their processes by a litigant, and that is precisely what the rule at issue here does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.823" offset="6136931">If a civil claimant is allowed to participate in a civil forfeiture action while at the same time he refuses to stand trial on a criminal case that is based on the identical event, he may then use the very broad civil discovery rules that... to circumvent the very well settled and strict restrictions on criminal discovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.562" offset="6319892">Those rules limiting strictly criminal discovery exist because long experience has taught Congress and the courts that early disclosure of the Government's case in a criminal prosecution often leads to contrived defense testimony--</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.358" offset="6987060">Congress has not addressed the problem that we are faced with here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.829" offset="7044947">The second point, which I think is more important, is that the fact that Congress has dealt with an aspect of the issues that come up with cases when cases are related does not mean that the court ceases to have a very strong interest in keeping parties from abusing its processes, and that's what is at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.507" offset="7763732">One, of course, is the fact that he has shown to the court that he intends to play games with the court and maybe their answer is let's wait and see if he does it some more, but even... even accepting that that would be an acceptable answer, it is not an acceptable answer to the more fundamental problem that we are identifying, which is that by getting discovery and allowing... and being allowed to litigate the civil forfeiture action, he is circumventing the criminal discovery rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.177" offset="12734416">This case, however, is different, because in this case the Federal prosecutor said to the district judge in an argument, made and reproduced on page 6a of the appendix to our brief, that there was no need to stay the forfeiture proceedings one minute longer in deference to the criminal case precisely because the cat was out of the bag in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.973" offset="12829606">There was no need to protect against the disclosure of witnesses, no need to protect against the disclosure of any evidence, and in response to the prosecutor's argument, the district court said, fine, you can go ahead and take all the depositions you want... Karen Degen, the petitioner's wife, and in an order that's reflected in the minutes of the February 1, 1993 transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="3278.233" offset="13254566">The other red herring I'd like to deal with is the argument that the Government has already established its right to this money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.521" offset="13287794">What it has established is its right to the seizure of this money and this property through a prima facie showing, to be sure, but if I can be indulged one other Latinism, it's also completely ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.838" offset="13337009">They went into court with a complaint and an affidavit that, you know, to my mind barely shows probable cause to believe any of the property was in fact used in violation of 881(a)(6) and (a)(7), and now they have the money, and now, as the law permits, it's our burden to come into court and overcome that prima facie showing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.028" offset="13497819">They've gone in and shown that they have at least that much of a claim, but the law then permits Mr. Degen to come in and overcome it, and you know, if his unavailability prejudices his capacity to make that showing, then he's so much the worse for it.</text>
