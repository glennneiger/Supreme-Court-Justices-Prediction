            <text syncTime="3106.746" offset="12570909">Part of the premise of your argument is, the value of recognizing the privilege depends upon the value of the confidentiality in the relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.103" offset="12676340">And so I guess what we would have to do is to say well, if majority of the States have really strong privileges, that would probably justify our recognition of the strong privilege, but if a majority of the States have a weak privilege, it wouldn't do any good for us, at least in those States, to recognize a strong privilege because it would have no effect on the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.028" offset="12764007">The social worker would have to say, I can't guarantee much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.351" offset="12777277">Is that what we should do, is sort of do a nose count and find out whether we're going to get much for our privilege or a little for our privilege?</text>
