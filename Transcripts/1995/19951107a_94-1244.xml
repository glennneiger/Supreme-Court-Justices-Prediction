            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142439">We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1244, John W. Behrens v. Robert Pelletier.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="177861">Mr. Weiss, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lenard G. Weiss</label>
            <text syncTime="14.408" offset="200013">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.843" offset="209730">The issue here is, can the court of appeals refuse, on jurisdictional grounds, to hear an interlocutory, qualified immunity appeal solely on the grounds that it is the second such appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="30.019" offset="262498">There are two Bivens claims pleaded in this case before the Court, one, a job termination claim that the plaintiff says he has a constitutionally protected property interest in his contingent employment with Pioneer Savings and Loan, and was deprived of due process when that... when Pioneer terminated him, and the second claim is that he had a constitutionally protected liberty interest in pursuing other employment in the financial services industry which was impaired by the stigmatizing circumstances of his departure from Pioneer.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.406" offset="396036">On the first interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit in this case, following a motion to dismiss and prior to discovery, the Ninth Circuit did three things: it announced its categorical one-appeal jurisdictional rule, it affirmed the district court's denial of qualified immunity as to the job search claim, the first claim, and it revived a previously dismissed job termination claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.641" offset="500943">Excuse me, I may have misspoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.026" offset="514527">It affirmed the job search finding by the lower court and revived the job termination claim, which had been dismissed on a statute of limitations basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.549" offset="548591">On remand, after full discovery, petitioner moved for summary judgment on his qualified immunity defense to the Bivens claims, and that motion was denied on both claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.839" offset="593730">In the Ninth Circuit, the Court dismissed petitioner's second interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction solely on the basis of its previously announced one-appeal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.379" offset="635944">I would like to make several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.731" offset="645348">First, this case fits squarely within the appealable orders criteria of the Mitchell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.885" offset="669903">Second, the one-appeal rule effectively emasculates the qualified immunity as immunity from suit, pretrial and litigation burdens of suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.376" offset="715879">Thirds, the concerns over abuse and judicial economy are misplaced.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="148.846" offset="737822">Well, how many times is a district court expected to entertain a motion for summary judgment in the same case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lenard_g_weiss" startTime="156.000" stopTime="170.760">
            <label>Mr. Lenard G. Weiss</label>
            <text syncTime="156.000" offset="766348">Normally, I... normally a summary judgment motion in the same case will only occur on one occasion, and normally the district courts that I practice in front of are very careful about scheduling when summary judgment will occur and will not occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.760" offset="825384">So your question arises when there's been an appeal from a motion... a denial of a motion to dismiss, then the second time around on summary judgment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lenard G. Weiss</label>
            <text syncTime="180.568" offset="864672">Precisely, and usually it comes up in the context of a motion to dismiss, because the question is whether the law is settled or not, and sometimes that is a relatively easy question to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.006" offset="902393">Perhaps it would have been in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.923" offset="910126">We would have thought so.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.791" offset="913574">If it does... if that's not clear, then you have to go through some discovery, at least, and go through the motion for summary judgment stage.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="200.045" offset="942517">In that kind of case, where there's an argument at the motion to dismiss stage, and yet there is some indication that further pleadings and discovery will elucidate the issues, does the district court have the authority to say, I want all summary judgment motions relating to sovereign immunity deferred until 6 months of discovery has gone by, I'm not even going to rule on the motion to dismiss, or must he rule on the motion to dismiss?</text>

            <text syncTime="228.464" offset="1056202">A question I'm not certain of the answer, Your Honor, but I believe the court must respond to the motion to dismiss.</text>
