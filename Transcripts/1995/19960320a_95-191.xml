            <text>We'll hear argument now in Number 95-191, O'Hare Truck Service, Incorporated v. The City of Northlake.</text>
            <text>Mr. Grossman.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case is about whether the First Amendment provides any level of protection whatsoever to a businessman who's cut out from city business after 30 years of competent performance in retaliation for refusing to contribute to the mayor's reelection campaign and supporting the opposition.</text>
            <text>This penalty on association invoked in this case resulted in the substantial loss of income to Mr. Gratzianna, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text>I wish to focus first on the aspect of forced contribution involved in the conduct of the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text>The precipitating event was Mr. Gratzianna's refusal to be coerced out of a substantial campaign contribution.</text>
            <text>Making that contribution would have been contrary to his own political beliefs.</text>
            <text>This conduct by the respondent should be condemned, not sanitized as patronage practice which purports to serve the democratic process.</text>
            <text>This practice corrupts rather than advances any meaningful interests of government.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I think that there are bribery and corruption laws that would reach a situation of quid pro quo, if you give me or you give my party $200 I will give you a contract.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>I think that is correct, Your Honor, but what we seek here is a civil remedy when the burden of reasonable doubt is not imposed on the petitioner, where--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You don't need Elrod and subsequent cases, and Rutan, in order to enforce that kind of prohibition.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--I agree with you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>I do not believe that the petitioner's rights here are dependent upon the public employment patronage cases whatsoever.</text>
            <text>I believe there is independent doctrine that we've cited in our briefs which prohibit penalties on association, which prohibit forced contributions, and which also allow people to express themselves politically particularly in their private work place or on their private property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I'm not saying that that... that those statutes apply here.</text>
            <text>I'm just saying, where there is a quid pro quo.</text>
            <text>I'm not sure that was established as the factual situation here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>No, I don't believe that within the confines of the criminal law that a quid pro quo was established here, but what we seek to do, and I want to stress to Your Honor, is an opportunity to provide a court with the proof of what did occur, and have a court determine whether or not that violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text>What's critical here is that the lower courts have said that there is no First Amendment protection whatsoever, so notwithstanding the ability of a litigant even to prove the quid pro quo that you've suggested--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Bribery laws aren't dependent on the First Amendment.</text>
            <text>I mean, you know, they apply whether you're saying give me $50 for my own coffer or give me $50 for the party.</text>
            <text>I don't think those bribery and corruption laws have any relationship to the First Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--I wasn't suggesting that they did, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>I was suggesting that even if you place that burden on the litigant here, that he nevertheless should have an opportunity to go before a civil court and prove that the violation of his First Amendment's, whether it resulted from a quid pro quo, or the implicit imposition of a penalty, as it did this case, violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text>Because there are criminal laws that exist to protect interests does not mean that we do not have corollaries in the civil law which also under our Constitution provide a means for redress.</text>
            <text>There are numerous instances where that occurs, from instances of policemen's conduct in illegal search and seizure, straight through the panoply of constitutional--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, his corollary would be, I was asked for a bribe, and I was... my contract was terminated because I refused to pay a bribe.</text>
            <text>The corollary would not be, I have a cause of action because you violated my First Amendment rights.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--No, the civil formulation... I respectfully disagree with Your Honor.</text>
            <text>I think the civil formulation of that is that in fact his First Amendment rights were violated as well, independent of the question of whether the Government has chosen, responsibly, I think, to create official misconduct laws or extortion laws.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Then you are not relying on the corruption statutes, you're relying on the Rutan-Elrod line of cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>No, I'm not, Your Honor, although I think that those cases can very well be instructive in terms of analyzing the Government's interest that it might assert in this case.</text>
            <text>I don't say that they transfer in toto, because I wish to stress that I did not represent a public employee.</text>
            <text>The gentleman that appears before this Court cannot conceivably be compared to a public employee.</text>
            <text>He does not provide services in the Government work place or at a Government work site.</text>
            <text>He does not work shoulder-to-shoulder with other Government employees.</text>
            <text>He has no Government supervisor.</text>
            <text>He is not in a chain of command.</text>
            <text>His services are straightforward.</text>
            <text>They're determined by the custom and practices within the industry in which he works.</text>
            <text>He can't be said to speak for the city or any official.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, Mr. Grossman, in protecting, for example, the free speech rights of public employees, the Court has employed some kind of a balancing test, the so-called Pickering approach, and has recognized interests of the employer as well as those of the employees.</text>
            <text>Do you think that the independent contractor has rights greater than that of an employee?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>I do.</text>
            <text>I think there's a continuum on which independent contractors provide services.</text>
            <text>I think that the closer that they look like employees... and I've just gone five or six factors myself... the closer that they look like employees, I think more legitimately can they be regulated as public employees.</text>
            <text>My client--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But you would propose to us, at least, the employment of a stricter level of scrutiny for the... your client, the independent contractor, than would be the case for an employee?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--Yes, I would, and I think that it's important to note that in this Court's jurisprudence regarding the regulation of public employees and their First Amendment rights as recently as its decision in Waters, it stressed that it really was not the operation of Government per se, or Governmental efficiency, that resulted in a freer hand in restricting the rights of public employees, it was the nature of the employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text>And this Court said that what was comparatively a subordinate interest vis-a-vis the general public... that is, operational efficiency... becomes more pronounced and weighty when you're talking about the interaction of an employee in the workforce, understandably, just based on every-day human relations, and I don't challenge whatsoever that proposition, but when--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But there's a real concern, isn't there, for opening up a great deal of litigation in the Government contracting field if we find such a strong interest on the part of the independent contractor?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--Well, first, if the question is, should there be a cognizable claim at all, that doesn't deal with the standard.</text>
            <text>If the question is, should contractors be subjected to a reasonableness balancing standard instead of strict scrutiny, at least we're half-way there already, because all of the courts below have said that there's no level of scrutiny that's to be applied to this conduct.</text>
            <text>Now, even if a reasonableness test was applied here, I would maintain that whatever it is that the respondents maintain they've done here... we view it as a simple act of political retaliation and forced contribution.</text>
            <text>It's been siphoned through the screen of patronage law, but whatever it is, we believe that it would not withstand even a reasonable balancing test.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, what if a new administration in Northlake comes to power, and they're trying to put together a list of their own as to who's going to get the tow truck business, is it in your view a violation of First Amendment rights if they were to just put on that list that they're compiling for the first time a list of people who contributed to their campaign?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>No, I would not.</text>
            <text>Without more facts, I do not believe that that would state a violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text>I'm not exactly--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So you have to remove someone from a list that already exists to come into your purview?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--Well, I think this Court need only deal with this case as a termination of a benefit, a penalty case.</text>
            <text>It need not decide what might be a more perplexing question for some members of the Court as to whether--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What more facts would you have needed in the Chief Justice's hypothetical?</text>
            <text>What about the additional fact that it is established that the reason only these people were included was these were the only people that gave money to the party?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--Well, I believe that if... I'm not sure I understand the hypothetical with clarity.</text>
            <text>If it would result in the termination--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>No termination.</text>
            <text>It's a new--</text>

          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--So it is only termination.</text>
            <text>Why do you draw the line there?</text>
            <text>If you're going to draw the line xx, why not draw the line at independent contractors?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--No, I'm not sure that I understand the precise distinction that you're making between the termination--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Grossman--</text>
            <text>--I thought that your principle was, look if there was actual harm that my client has suffered by reason of his First Amendment beliefs.</text>
            <text>Now, one kind of harm is being terminated from a contract.</text>
            <text>Another kind of harm is not getting a contract that you would otherwise get.</text>

          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>

            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--That's clearly the case, and I think in the proper benefits case... I'm not suggesting that I don't think there are parallels in the law that would support a claim that a denial of a contract also would be actionable, but that's not the case before this Court.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I understand it's not the case, but I don't know why you don't gobble up that case.</text>

            <text>--there are visiting dignitaries that come to town, the White House has dinners for them, and it is not uncommon for significant donors to the party that occupies the White House to be invited to those dinners and not donors to the other party.</text>
            <text>Now, what about that?</text>
            <text>This... I'm sure this comes out of public funds from somewhere.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>--I believe that the person you've described has a political identity.</text>
            <text>That is, the President.</text>
            <text>I think he's free to exercise that role as well as his role as executive administering the laws.</text>

          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>Because he has, in this precise instance, chosen to terminate a business relationship.</text>
            <text>It isn't a question of opening up access to other qualified persons who happen to give him a contribution.</text>
            <text>It is, instead, a direct penalty on belief because he has terminated a 30-year-old benefit to an individual simply on the grounds of refusal to contribute.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What is... where I'm having trouble, and I'm simply asking for help, is, forget your case.</text>
            <text>If your case were here alone and you could decide it separately, I think you, in my view, might well win.</text>
            <text>But what's bothering me about it is it's connected to all kinds of other cases involving Government contractors, and at this point I don't know how to draw a line.</text>
            <text>That is, what's bothering me about the line, and I really don't know, is, it is not the case... I mean, there are important Government interests in not getting the courts too involved in this.</text>
            <text>All 50 States have responsible bidding laws of some kind.</text>
            <text>Illinois, the word responsible low bidder appears 135 times in the statutes, so by and large they've statutorily taken care of the problem except in certain instances like yours, and also in defining the word responsible.</text>
            <text>And if every time a Democrat loses a contract, or a Republican loses a contract, he can go into court, then the administrators of the contracting system must look for objective criteria so that they can prove they weren't motivated by the political reason, and at that point their ability to award contracts is severely injured.</text>
            <text>They can't use subjective judgment.</text>
            <text>That's the kind of thing that goes under the title, efficiency of Government, and what I'm looking for is some kind of line that you would propose that permits that consideration called efficiency of Government to still work while protecting, let's say, the egregious case that you might have found, and I don't know how to draw that line.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_grossman">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>
            <text>Well, I think first, just as a note, over $200 million worth of no-bid contracts were allocated by the State of Illinois in 1991--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">

            <text>I understand that, Your Honor, and I believe that this Court will have formulated... let me try to put it into the real world for a second.</text>
            <text>Illinois has filed an amicus brief in this case.</text>
            <text>It has shown that what it did was seek out professional consultation through a professional management company which has restructured its workforce and has provided the very standards that Justice Breyer suggests exist that reflect some objective merit-based hiring.</text>
            <text>Since that has occurred, you can see from the response in our reply brief, there are virtually no employees who are winning political discharge cases, and there are no employees winning promotion cases, because the Mt.</text>
            <text>Healthy burden which I suggested to you allows government to come in and show an independent, permissible basis.</text>
            <text>It does not mean--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>We don't know what the cost of that is.</text>
            <text>I mean, what Justice Breyer is concerned about is there is a place in government for subjective evaluation, and perhaps especially in contracting, not just for who has the lowest bid and all sorts of numerical and objective criteria, but for factors that must be subjectively evaluated.</text>
            <text>They have to be cast away if there is this risk of litigation on the basis of awarding it to somebody of the wrong party.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey Grossman</label>

            <text>The same thing is true.</text>
            <text>There is a subjective evaluation that is made between equally competent and qualified employees.</text>
            <text>It happens all the time in the workforce, and what the record is--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, but in the employment area, you see, there was an exception written in to Elrod and Branti, and that exception did cause a lot of litigation in the First Circuit.</text>
            <text>There were... we had six... there were 600 confidential employees fired when they changed government in Puerto Rico in 1984, the political... and 300 of them brought lawsuits.</text>
            <text>That was very tough to work out.</text>
            <text>What I'm looking for here is, is there a similar kind of exception?</text>
            <text>When you buy a pencil from the GSA, when the Government orders a pencil, often to buy a pencil there are all kinds of papers.</text>
            <text>It takes forever, and some of the reason for that was because the GSA was worried about being able to substantial 100 percent that there were no subjective impermissible factors going into the Government procurement process.</text>
            <text>That slows it down, stops it from working.</text>
            <text>So what is a standard whereby we can assure that that kind of thing can work, at the same time protect your client?</text>

            <text>It is the nature of that relationship, every-day functioning in the context of supervision, working with other people every day in the work place.</text>
            <text>Suppliers of office goods just don't look like that.</text>
            <text>Nor do towing operators look like that, and there is no reason to pull them out of the public and treat them to a lesser standard for very, very basic rights of where they put their campaign dollars.</text>

            <text>Would you say that that somehow could not be considered, it couldn't be balanced because at the moment of the speech he was simply a member of the general public?</text>

            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This Court has made clear that First Amendment rights are not absolute.</text>
            <text>There are encroachments or restrictions on First Amendment rights permissible for appropriate reasons, and when we're talking about an independent contractor context, those appropriate reasons exist.</text>
            <text>To rule in favor of petitioners and send this case back down to the district court, this Court must extend the holdings in Elrod, Branti, and Rutan to the independent contractor governmental context, and there are several reasons why that should not be done.</text>

            <text>He was just on a towing list.</text>

            <text>He would not be there but for the city calling him out to go there, and I think in that context the analysis of an independent contractor is the same, and my reading of the briefs is that the petitioners have essentially admitted that this is an independent contractor situation.</text>

            <text>It was alluded to a little bit before, but I think when you're talking about an independent contractor situation, you have a lot more disappointed independent contractors who don't get their bids accepted than you have employees who don't get hired, or who don't get promoted or transferred, or some other employment decision.</text>

            <text>It's clearly there in an independent contractor context, and there were some... there were questions previously about line-drawing in an independent contractor context.</text>

            <text>It did draw just precisely that distinction, and said it made a constitutional difference, but perhaps you're not familiar--</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary M. Feiereisel</label>
            <text>Well, in this line of cases with Elrod, Branti, and Rutan, that's all been basically lumped together, I think.</text>
            <text>Hiring, firing, promotion, transfer, whatever, you can't make any employment decisions unless the individual involved, or who the decision is being made against, falls within the exception to those cases.</text>
            <text>That scenario has created a lot of litigation.</text>
            <text>It has created inconsistent results between different courts, and I think that that will lead even more... or it will evidence itself even more strongly in a situation like this, where you have innumerable more independent contractor situations than you do employee situations.</text>
            <text>You have a situation where the administration that's in power should not have to run the risk of facing lawsuits, having to spend money on lawsuits in this kind of a context.</text>
            <text>You have... that's why there's so many qualified immunity defenses that are being raised, because in those situations the administration does not know, or the public official involved, is being dismissed from cases because they are not able to tell or were not able to tell from past decisions whether the decision they're making is constitutionally correct or incorrect, and I think that is only going to get multiplied if you extend the same First Amendment rights that have been extended to employees to the independent contractors.</text>
            <text>I've... there are a couple of other arguments I wanted to make.</text>
            <text>My time's running out so I'm not... I'll... they're in my brief.</text>
            <text>I know that one of the things we raised is that if the Court decides to... or before the Court decides to extend Rutan to this situation, I think that there... there should be consideration given to overruling Rutan because of the problems raised in our brief and the brief of the State of Illinois, the officials.</text>
            <text>In summary, it is our position that, when you're in an independent contractor context, their First Amendment rights in political association do not... or can be infringed because they are entitled... the administration, I am sorry, is entitled to rely on independent contracts... contractors, I'm sorry, that it knows supports its position, its administration, its program because that is the safest way, especially at the local level, to promote efficient and effective government.</text>

            <text>The... it actually varies.</text>
            <text>There are authorized tows where the... Mr. Gratzianna can only be on the scene with the authorization of the municipality.</text>
            <text>Those are abandoned vehicles.</text>
            <text>We've tried to explain that by citing Illinois law in our complaint.</text>
            <text>In those instances, the individual driver still pays, but they could not... it is similar to the licensing that has been described by Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text>The tower could not be on the scene without authorization from the city.</text>
            <text>There also are city tows where Mr. Gratzianna tows city vehicles and does that pursuant to the list as well.</text>
            <text>In those instances the city does pay money.</text>

            <text>In terms of the flood of litigation that was predicted here, I'd like to stress that Abercrombie in the Tenth Circuit has given these rights to public... to independent contractors since 1990, and there's been no litigation.</text>
            <text>Second, that I do think Mt.</text>
            <text>Healthy addresses the question of the flood, but nevertheless I have also attempted to carve out in our briefs an exception that does parallel those considerations recognized in Elrod and Branti, and that is that in those few instances where independent contractors move down that line and do provide services which, in terms of implementing policy--</text>
