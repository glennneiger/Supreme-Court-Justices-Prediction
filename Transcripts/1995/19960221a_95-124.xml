            <text syncTime="21.496" offset="223977">This case presents a question of constitutional analysis of section 10 of the 1992 Cable Act, which in turn amended provisions of the Federal Cable Act of 1984 that dealt with public and leased access channels on cable systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.839" offset="289387">It is important to note that public and leased access channels are not a creation of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.612" offset="316450">As this Court noted in the Turner Broadcasting case just 18 months ago, cable companies owe their very existence to municipalities giving them by contract the rights of way in their community to lay and string their cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.455" offset="379875">That's encompassed in a franchising agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.490" offset="391996">As part of that franchising agreement, that contract between the municipal government and the cable company, it had become a practice in the sixties, seventies, and eighties for municipalities, without any inspiration from the Federal Government or requirement by the Federal Government, to insist as a condition of allowing entrance of the cable companies and allowing them to speak in the very first instance, that they set aside channels for the public, and those channels were supposed to be used and are used on a first come, first served, nondiscriminatory basis, free of editorial control and, in fact, in the usual case--</text>

            <text syncTime="180.515" offset="860110">There was a general feeling and a fear on the part of municipalities when they opened their city for the laying and stringing of cable that they were allowing a kind of monopoly, or at least a bottleneck, into their community with regard to the speech over the cable system, and they wanted to let people unaffiliated with the cable company... that is, the public in general and people who wanted to use leased access... to come on and be able to use that free of editorial control by the cable operator.</text>

            <text syncTime="1862.652" offset="7588626">The whole point of this Court's remand in Turner Broadcasting was based on its holding that cable operators do have First Amendment rights and further findings were needed to see whether the must-carry provisions at issue in that case were a valid restriction on those First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.053" offset="7694266">Indeed, point 2 of the Court's opinion in Turner Broadcasting starts with the following sentence: there can be no disagreement on an initial premise cable programmers and cable operators engage in and transmit speech and they are entitled to the protection of the speech and press provisions of the First Amendment, so Justice Breyer's question is very much in point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.024" offset="7826132">Access programmers are a special category of cable programmers first provided for by Congress in the 1984 act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1960.733" offset="7980986">The public access programs, the so-called PEG access programming, public, educational, and governmental, was already quite common and Congress merely authorized franchising authorities to continue that at their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.079" offset="8062383">But what Congress did do that was new was to make access programmers a special category by providing that the operators, the cable operators would have no editorial control, no editorial discretion with respect to programming on those channels.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.236" offset="8815023">Precisely so, Justice Ginsburg, and I... what I want to try to clarify in leading up to addressing that is what we see as the scope of governmental action involved here that is subject to the restrictions of the First Amendment, that does have to comply with the First Amendment, and what is in our view not governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.291" offset="8939157">Sections 10(a) and 10(c) of the 1992 act readjust the distribution of editorial discretion between the operators and the programmers with respect to indecent programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.918" offset="9009688">To that extent, an act of Congress does constitute governmental action, and has to be consistent with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.893" offset="9057648">But as the court of appeals recognized in its analysis of the case, any such adjustment by Congress between these two protected groups is what could be described as a move in a zero sum game for First Amendment purposes, because any conferral of discretion on one correspondingly diminishes the discretion that the other one would have over programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.810" offset="9173319">There's still the same total amount of programming available to the viewing public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.781" offset="9193172">It's just a question of who's exercising the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.733" offset="9208950">So we have suggested that if that... the adjustment is made, regardless of whether the 1984 act came first or the 1982 act came first, if that adjustment is made in a reasonable manner that is viewpoint neutral, then it should be upheld, because Congress is not trying to influence what people can hear by dictating views that will be made available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.521" offset="9748117">What Congress thought was in the public interest, at least judging by the provisions it enacted, is that because of a consideration this Court recognized in Turner Broadcasting, it's to the advantage of the public to have a multiplicity of sources available to provide programming and therefore the access programming itself, which has to be from unaffiliated sources, that the cable operator is required to carry, is something that serves the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.134" offset="9934527">But Congress was also concerned that an operator, a cable operator who is providing these services should not be required against its will to become a purveyor of indecent programming over its system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.881" offset="10009550">It is the one with the direct contact with the consuming public, and providing the service and selling the service, and so Congress thought that the operator should have that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.807" offset="10073289">And our view is that the First Amendment does not require Congress to sacrifice one of those aspects of the public interest to the other, that it can allow this kind of programming to be available on access channels but at the operator's discretion in order to serve both aspects of what Congress reasonably concluded is in the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.738" offset="14189038">It's not a question of consumer choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.850" offset="14793407">The commercial access channel that's recounted in the record in some detail is Channel 35, the Time Warner channel in New York City, which has practically nonstop indecent programming on it put on by a variety of programmers who come on a first-come, first-served basis.</text>
