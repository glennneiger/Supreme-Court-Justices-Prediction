            <text syncTime="1551.647" offset="6351891">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.051" offset="6365579">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c) provides that a motion for judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the Court may fix during the 7-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.127" offset="6417824">Our position is that when a defendant makes a judgment, motion for judgment of acquittal outside that time limit, as occurred in this case, the district court lacks authority to grant that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.223" offset="6454291">We also take the position that the district court's authority to enter a judgment of acquittal on its own motion is constrained by that same time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.520" offset="6483444">To begin with, the mandatory nature of the Rule 29(c) time limit is dictated, in our view, by the plain language of Rule 45(b), which this Court took up in United States v. Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.455" offset="6523150">Rule 45(b) allows district courts to enlarge most time limits under the Federal Rules either upon a showing of cause or after the time limit has lapsed upon a showing of excusable neglect, but it carves out a specific exempt... exception for Rule 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.253" offset="6574350">It provides that the Court may not take any time for taking... extended time for taking any action under Rules 29, 33, 34, and 35, except to the extent and under the circumstances stated in those rules, and in Robinson this Court stated and held that that language was, in the Court's terms, quite plain and clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.371" offset="8370843">The citation that petitioner has referred to in his claim that is new law is a Sentencing Guidelines case called Jenkins.</text>

            <text syncTime="2071.342" offset="8430715">It has nothing to do with sufficiency, and I think that's clear from the oral discussion, which is reprinted in the joint appendix, that the district court goes through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.678" offset="8460077">But more generally, even if there is a change of law outside the time limit set by Rule 29(c), the rule simply does not authorize a district court to revisit the issue, to open up the issue on sufficiency outside that time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.496" offset="8511382">Now, there is a different recourse in the rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.138" offset="13141951">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.950" offset="13153132">There are a couple of points I'd like to make Justice O'Connor asked the question, well, this really wasn't sua sponte by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.744" offset="13184374">In fact, this was by a motion, but I think procedurally if you look at what happened in this case the motion was filed, the motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.138" offset="13209870">There was no motion pending in front of the court when the judge made his decision in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.573" offset="13235679">Now, it's true that Judge Enslin back in August had written two separate opinions and two separate orders, and then just changed them and then did... on the order does say it's based on a motion by the defendant, but I think it's clear in this case there was no motion pending, and the judge made that decision sua sponte.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Christopherson</label>
            <text syncTime="3294.556" offset="13323555">He denied the motion in August and, again, in the transcript he said, I agonized and wrote two separate opinions, and then when it came the day for sentencing he called the counsel in and on the record explained that he had changed his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.395" offset="13374964">The other point I'd like to raise is I think, in looking at the rule, this Court has to look at what rule is going to be used to construe that rule, and one point I'd like to make to the court is that the day that Houston v. Lack was decided this Court also decided the Torres case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.796" offset="13436508">In that case the Court indicated that in construing the rules they should be construed liberally with a view that cases should be decided on their merits as opposed to on procedure, and I think if you use that type of analysis that the majority used in the Torres case, apply it to Rule 29, that under these facts the court should have the power to consider the issue of insufficiency of the evidence prior to the time of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.143" offset="13541938">Thank you.</text>
