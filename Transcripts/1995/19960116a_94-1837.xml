            <text syncTime="11.910" offset="189240">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.892" offset="201256">This case concerns the validity of a Florida statute enacted in 1974 that flatly prohibits financial institutions such as banks, including national banks, from selling life and fire insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.616" offset="280146">The case is here on certiorari to the Eleventh Circuit, which upheld the Florida law on the remarkable proposition that a law that prohibits banks from selling life insurance is, within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a law that regulates the business of insurance, while a 1916 Federal law that explicitly does the contrary and authorizes national banks to sell life insurance is not, within the meaning of the very same McCarran-Ferguson Act, a law that specifically relates to the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.194" offset="462376">The statement of that proposition is, we submit, its own refutation.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.479" offset="487558">Flatly prohibiting all banks from engaging in the business of being an insurance agent is, we believe, not a bona fide regulation of the business of insurance, but if it is, then its converse, the 1916 Federal law that authorizes national banks to do precisely what the Florida law prohibits... that is, to sell life insurance through licensed agents... must be a law that specifically relates to the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.464" offset="643457">Now, that language that I've been referring to... regulates the business of insurance or relates to the business of insurance... grows out of the two pronged test of validity prescribed by the McCarran-Ferguson Act whenever an act of Congress conflicts with any law enacted by any State.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.402" offset="751290">Mr. Lewin, I assume that the Florida courts and the... or the Eleventh Circuit's view of the matter is that the Florida statute is a statute that governs insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.534" offset="815761">It's about insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.126" offset="822135">The Federal statute is a statute that's about banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.659" offset="840316">Now, what it says banks can do is sell insurance, but I think what the Eleventh Circuit says is that doesn't specifically relate to insurance within the meaning of the statute, because the provision is about banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.728" offset="1408531">Mr. Lewin, even so, why can't one read these two provisions, the State and Federal, as compatible, as not in conflict?</text>
            <text syncTime="325.704" offset="1444476">The Federal law may specifically relate to insurance, but why not... as one of your opponents argued, why not read the Federal law as simply giving the banks permission to enter this line of business which it couldn't enter without Federal permission, just giving it Federal permission, yet subject to whatever regulation the State may choose to put on it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="351.870" offset="1549175">--Justice Ginsburg, there are several answers, I think, to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.493" offset="1563594">First of all, because the statute does not specifically say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.917" offset="1581357">Congress knew how it could say, as our adversaries say, national banks are simply empowered to engage in the business of selling insurance if the State permits them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.778" offset="1636737">The statute, section 92, submits the national bank only to the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.044" offset="1673831">It says the insurance company whose policies are being sold has to be a company which is authorized by the State authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.522" offset="1723777">It does not say that the national bank has to be authorized by the State authorities, and the Congress that considered and enacted section 92, the very same Congress, also considered the question of branch banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.344" offset="1783023">When it did so, and this appears I think more extensively in an amicus brief that's filed by a whole group of banking, local State banking associations, the Court can see, I think, at page 13 of that brief where Congress put into the branch banking provisions that it was considering language which would have subjected the national banks to the authority of the State before they could open branch banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.997" offset="1917606">Congress didn't do that with section 92, so our first point is that the statutory language argues against that reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.644" offset="1956267">Our second point is that the Comptroller of the Currency constant interpretation argues against that reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.290" offset="1986778">The Comptroller of the Currency, of course, is the one who is authorized to administer this authority under section 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.824" offset="2016975">This Court very recently in its VALIC decision pointed out how the Court gave deference to the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Comptroller of the Currency since the enactment of this law has always read it as meaning that the national banks have authority independently of what the State may or may not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.827" offset="2256988">Our adversaries are trying to make the Court believe that maybe that's the consequence of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.433" offset="2279349">It is not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.174" offset="2282379">What we are saying is, banks under section 92 are permitted to sell insurance, and then subject to the regulation, of the kind of regulation that Congress had in mind when it enacted McCarran-Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.477" offset="2347581">It knew that prior to the South-Eastern Underwriters case there was a whole web of regulation on the part of the States of the business of insurance, including the licensure of agents, and consequently when it enacted McCarran-Ferguson it maintained that system of regulation in place, but when a State comes in after the fact and for motives that are not the protection of policyholders with regard to the integrity or the ability of insurance agents, but which are anticompetitive motives, and we think that clearly emerges from this, the history of this statute as well--</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.174" offset="7594327">By enacting the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Congress has broadly reserved to the States regulation of the business of insurance and declared that State regulation of the business of insurance is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.643" offset="7652215">Congress' intent to throw the weight of its power behind State regulation is clearly expressed in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.620" offset="7692130">The Department of Insurance's position is that once a State law is established to regulate the business of insurance by protecting policyholders, that State law is preempted by a Federal law only if the Federal law is a clear statement that Congress intended for the State's regulation of the business of insurance to be displaced.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel Y. Sumner</label>
            <text syncTime="2079.842" offset="8460966">Okay, let's basically start with the fundamentals of the regulation of the business of insurance and the insurer-policyholder relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.956" offset="8493462">The insurer-policyholder relationship is consummated in an insurance contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.601" offset="8520002">That insurance contract needs to be enforceable, it needs to be reliable, and it needs to be fairly and suitably entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.336" offset="8558977">The individual who is responsible for bringing those parties together and creating an enforceable, reliable, and suitable insurance contract is the insurance agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.846" offset="8617073">Therefore, I think the first question is, is the role of the insurance agent in that insurance transaction, in making sure you have an enforceable, reliable, and suitable insurance contract, part of the insurance policy, insurer-policyholder relationship?</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.276" offset="8678722">I think the answer to that definitely is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.437" offset="8687395">The question then becomes, if the insurance agent is an integral player in making sure that the insurer-policyholder relationship occurs, then if the Florida legislature has found that the interjection of a national bank into the role of the agent in that insurer-policyholder relationship creates the dangers of coercion, unfair trade practices, and undue concentration of resources, whether or not that interjection of those perils into the insurer-policyholder relationship is a legitimate regulation of the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.246" offset="8858654">There may be issues raised by the petitioner as to the wisdom of whether there was some other way of handling those perils, but if you look at the Michael M. case, the question is if the legislature has identified a particular method of addressing perils with regard to the protection of policyholders, then normally the Court gives great deference to the State's judgment, which has been ratified by the State courts, as to the manner in which that particular danger will be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.681" offset="9004417">The petitioner repeatedly asserts that the dangers that have been asserted are disingenuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.246" offset="9038585">There is no record evidence, other than the preamble, which would in any way suggest that the State court cases, Production Credit and Glendale, which are cited on pages 20 and 21 of the Department of Insurance brief, are not the most accurate articulation of the purposes of this law, and I would point out that the law was enacted in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.914" offset="9145269">The Production case in 1978 indicated on page 20 that the legislature has found in Florida that there is inherent potential for abuse in banks engaging in insurance agent activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.614" offset="9200126">In 1991 in the Glendale case the Florida appellate court--</text>

            <text syncTime="2272.501" offset="9231682">--Okay, if you want to talk about... I think one of the issues is, why is there a prohibition against bank holding companies and not all banks in allowing the small town bank to sell insurance in Florida?</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.932" offset="9293331">I believe that goes most directly to the issue of undue concentration of resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.696" offset="9316424">The argument which explains that particular element of the danger is that if a bank holding company is entitled, as the Comptroller has allowed, through a branch in a small town, to market in any geographical area, then that bank holding company can concentrate its entire marketing force into that one location and essentially use it as a venue to engage in the insurance business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.408" offset="9463232">Well, first of all, I think that in the legislature's judgment I believe there was a sense that with regard to credit life three was more of a nexus between the bank's interest in protecting loans and protecting credit than there was in the sale of other insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.013" offset="9545674">That, it would seem to me, would increase the likelihood that the bank would in fact unduly use its power to influence the issue of, the issuance of this insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.362" offset="9591127">If the bank wants to be insured against anything, it wants to be insured against losing its loan return because of debt, so I should suppose the bank's temptation would be very high there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.123" offset="9666151">No, but if... but it's a legislative judgment that seems to me to be at odds with the rationale that you were saying was the legislative purpose within the meaning of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.631" offset="9708156">If you look at the Department of Insurance brief at page 5, in the record there's testimony that as the exception to 626.988, that in Florida the credit line has become an area where reverse competition has occurred, and that because of that reverse competition, where the competition is not for purposes of gaining customers but to gain market share, that the commission levels in those products have gone to as much as 80 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.091" offset="9817975">So it very well may be that the credit line, by the record testimony, is an example of the fact that perhaps the legislature should have made another judgment with regard to that particular line of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.567" offset="9863950">Well, I suppose you could say that no statute pursues its objectives at all costs, and the legislature just said there's such a overwhelming reason why a bank would want to sell its own insurance in these situations that although the same risks might exist, we won't extend our prohibition that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.622" offset="9944094">That's possible, I suppose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.474" offset="10015565">One of the issues that's very important is that with the sale of insurance products, that there is the peril that the insurance-buying person will become deceived as to what is a bank product and what is an insurance product, so I think that more than just the problem of tying it to a loan, there's the problem of in essence a deception in consumers being misled.</text>
