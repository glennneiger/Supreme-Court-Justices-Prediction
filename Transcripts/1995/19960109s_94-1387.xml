            <text syncTime="11.522" offset="126960">This controversy sends some of the tragic death of 12 year old Natalie Calhoun in the summer of 1989 in a jet ski accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.150" offset="173458">On vacation with family friends at the Beach Park resort in Puerto Rico, Natalie whose home state was Pennsylvania rented a jet ski made by petitioner Yamaha Motor Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.035" offset="228942">While riding the jet ski, Natalie slammed into a vessel anchored in waters fronting the hotel and was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.856" offset="264260">Natalie’s parents, respondent Lucien and Robin Calhoun sued Yamaha in Federal District Court alleging that the jet ski was defectively designed or made.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.669" offset="311489">The Calhouns sought to recover damages under Pennsylvania’s wrongful death and survival statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.884" offset="340328">Yamaha argued that state remedies could not be applied because the death occurred in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.529" offset="374914">In 1970, in Moragne against States Marine Lines this Court recognized a federal maritime action for wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.838" offset="416188">That action governed, Yamaha contended, to the exclusion of more generous remedies available under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.263" offset="453909">The District Court agreed with Yamaha that state remedies were unavailable to the Calhouns but the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.966" offset="496645">We hold in accord with the Third Circuit that state wrongful death remedies remain applicable in cases of disorder in which no federal status specifies the appropriate relief and the decision was not engage in a maritime trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.862" offset="572296">Traditionally, courts have applied state remedy in such cases, the sole question we address is whether the Moragne decision could an end to that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.600" offset="623182">Our answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.202" offset="633631">Moragne centered on the extension of relief, where there was ones avoid and not on a contraction of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.074" offset="669158">Grounded in a humane and liberal character of admiralty law, Moragne cannot be read to displace state remedy traditionally available to believe parties like the Calhouns.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.739" offset="723806">The decision is unanimous.</text>
