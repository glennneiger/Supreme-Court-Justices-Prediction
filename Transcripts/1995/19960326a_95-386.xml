            <text syncTime="3065.088" offset="12397781">I think the Southwest Airlines case versus the Texas International case is very much on point in that regard, Justice Stevens, because the privity, if you will, was created in that case by the identity of interest in the single, narrow legal issue that was presented, which was the litigation of the validity of a Dallas ordinance prohibiting the use of Love Field, and it had been decided earlier that that ordinance violated Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.467" offset="12515332">All of the airlines who wanted to exclude Southwest from Love Field had a tremendous economic interest, but the court held that they were precluded from further litigating that question because their legal as opposed to their economic interest was indistinguishable from that of the City of Dallas and others who had litigated the same public question before, and that is a case, I think, that meets your criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.794" offset="12616583">Now, they had notice, though, in the sense of actual notice, because of all the publicity attending the case, but not necessarily legal notice within the procedural requirements of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.440" offset="12663185">As I said earlier, I believe that this case is really governed by Hansberry v. Lee, which stood for several very fundamental points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.007" offset="12709474">One, I agree with the petitioners that it said the States are free, subject to Federal due process, to devise any kind of procedural vehicle for representational suits they desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.505" offset="12755450">Secondly, those representational suits will bind the members of the class who are represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.199" offset="12778229">Thirdly, it is a violation of due process if the representative of the class has a conflict of interest or does not adequately represent the members of the class, and that was a specific holding in Hansberry v. Lee, and finally, Hansberry v. Lee stands for the proposition that the question of adequate and fair representation in this kind of suit is a matter for retroactive examination by the courts when res judicata becomes a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.609" offset="12899855">And in that regard, it is consistent with the principle of Rule 23 that the certification of a class does not establish its preclusive effect for the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.933" offset="12961190">No question, Bedingfield was not a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.246" offset="12970385">Nobody ever considered it one, and contrast the lack of notice there with what was deemed not sufficient in Martin v. Wilks, where there, you had the Birmingham Firefighters Association that appeared, these later plaintiffs were members of the association, the court ordered that notice be published in both Birmingham newspapers for, I think, 30 days or so, they solicited opinions, asked everybody to come in, these organizations represented these people, you had much, much more notice type in the Martin v. Wilks than you had here, where you had none, zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.723" offset="13140286">Secondly, it could have been a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.525" offset="13151571">The county, if they had wanted it to barr everything forever, they could have come in... the Rules of Civil Procedure were in effect in Alabama for class actions 10 or 12 years before Bedingfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.434" offset="13195143">The county didn't want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.974" offset="13201308">They didn't want to make it a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.724" offset="13204338">They hoped nobody would ever raise legal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.524" offset="13211548">They didn't want to litigate it then, they don't want to litigate it today, they don't wan to litigate it tomorrow, but that's the party that should have made it that way by your dicta, or your ruling of both parties are the ones that best know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.422" offset="13255120">And lastly, in the Southwest Airlines case that he mentioned just then, that was a very different situation that the Fifth Circuit ruled in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.007" offset="13285422">The attorneys for the parties that were "nonparties" also filed amicus briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.271" offset="13310500">They attended the... they sat through the actual first proceeding, there was a lot of different fact situations different in the Southwest Airlines case than here, where you had absolutely no relationship--</text>
