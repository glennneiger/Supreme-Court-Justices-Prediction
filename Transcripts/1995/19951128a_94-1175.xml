            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="177132">The issue in this case is whether Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide interbank claims for damages under the Expedited Funds Availability Act and its implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.048" offset="231153">In the civil liability section of the act, which is codified at 12 United States Code, section 4010, Congress provided in subsection (d) that any action under this section may be brought in Federal court or State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.445" offset="308685">In subsection (f) of Section 4010, Congress provided for liability under this subsection for damages for violation of rules governing the interbank check payment system promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.906" offset="382559">The natural reading of this statutory language is that banks have an action under subsection (f) for violations of the check-processing rules, and Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide such actions under subsection (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="81.118" offset="451418">Congress placed subsection (f) in the civil liability section of the statute, section 4010 provides that depositor claims under subsection (a) maybe brought in Federal court, and there is simply no indication that Congress intended interbank claims to be adjudicated in a different forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.212" offset="615780">First of all, it's not consistent with the language of the statute, which says, liability under this subsection, that is, liability under Federal law rather than liability under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.837" offset="662278">Also, it would be highly unusual for Congress to provide for liability for damages under a Federal statute for a violation of Federal standards and rules, and yet not provide for a Federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.679" offset="725599">It would be particularly unusual in this context, where Congress clearly provided that depositors have a cause of action in Federal court sometimes for very small claims, for claims of as little as 100, and the much larger interbank claims we think ought to be treated the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.731" offset="933847">Those, I take it, are Federal standards to be interpreted as a matter of Federal common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.122" offset="983375">When Congress passed this act, it federalized to a substantial extent an area that had been an area of State law, and the Federal standards that the Federal Reserve Board has adopted under Regulation CC do impose significant new obligations on banks, including a duty of expeditious return of checks.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.951" offset="1894735">At most, it's a question of whether there's an action under subsection (f), and Congress did give a very broad grant of authority to the agency to promulgate interbank liability rules under that subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.293" offset="1948130">I think certainly at a minimum the board's view that it does not have the authority to adjudicate claims for violations of those rules is entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.649" offset="1985537">I would go a step further and say that the board's view that there is an action under subsection (f) is also a matter that the Court could properly defer to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.790" offset="2030050">The text of section 4010 is consistent with the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.128" offset="2059411">Congress was primarily concerned with expediting customer access to deposited funds, and to achieve that goal, it legislated funds availability schedules, and it required banks to disclose their funds availability policies to customers and also required banks to begin paying interest promptly, but Congress was also concerned with speeding up the interbank check payment system.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.945" offset="2166722">Congress recognized that the slowness of the system was a principal reason for the lengthy holds on checks, and it also recognized that if it required banks to make deposited funds available more quickly but did nothing about the slowness of the interbank payment system, banks would be exposed to a risk of loss of the checks ultimately were not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.124" offset="2259405">Now, Congress addressed this more technical issue about how to improve the check payment system not by legislating a particular solution, but by giving the Federal Reserve Board broad authority to regulate the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.698" offset="2317710">It directed the board to consider a variety of possible improvements to the system which are set out in 12 U.S.C. section 4008, it gave the Federal Reserve a broad grant of authority to regulate any aspect of the payment system, also in section 4008, and in 4010(f) it gave the board an additional grant of authority to establish liability rules for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.165" offset="2731594">But to return to purpose for a moment, in giving this additional grant in subsection (f) of authority not only to regulate any aspect of the system but to impose liability for damages, to establish liability rules, there's no indication that Congress intended civil liability claims for violations of these check processing rules to be adjudicated in a different forum, or handled differently from other civil liability claims under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.201" offset="2855728">The Seventh Circuit held that interbank claims should be adjudicated by the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.255" offset="2879970">There are at least five reasons why that interpretation is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.492" offset="2900868">First, it doesn't fit with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.611" offset="2913406">Congress authorized the Federal Reserve Board to impose on or allocate among banks risk of loss and liability, not to impose actual liability through adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.002" offset="2958964">That language is consistent with rule-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.204" offset="2971712">Second, it's inconsistent with the Coit principle that we've discussed that authority to adjudicate is not to be lightly inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.160" offset="3007552">Third, the administrative enforcement mechanisms available to the Federal Reserve Board simply don't include a mechanism for imposing liability for damages on a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.069" offset="3063245">They have remedies for cease and desist orders, civil penalties, the usual gamut of enforcement provisions, but not authority to have an adjudicative tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.877" offset="3114445">Fourth is the deference that's owed to the board's view that it lacks jurisdiction, and fifth is the sort of fragmented adjudications that would result under the court of appeals view.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.220" offset="3167839">Bank claims would go to an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.588" offset="3185289">In fact, there are several agencies that share authority for enforcing this, so there could be intraagency jurisdictional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.176" offset="3211620">If a bank had a State law claim, presumably that would go to State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.146" offset="3231473">If there were depositor claims arising out of the same set of facts, that could go to Federal court or State court, and it seems quite unlikely that Congress would have intended that sort of fragmentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.800" offset="3358115">The civil liability provisions of the EFA act indicate that Congress incended State and Federal courts to have jurisdiction over both depositor and interbank claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.156" offset="3395522">Section 4010(d) expressly provides that Federal district courts and other courts of competent jurisdiction may hear liability claims, and that jurisdictional provision draws no distinction between depositor claims and interbank claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.131" offset="3447454">Section 4010 does create two different causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.701" offset="3465739">Subsection (a) establishes rules that apply to depositor claims, while subsection (f) authorizes the board to promulgate or establish rules that apply to interbank claims, but that distinction makes no difference with regard to Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.977" offset="3530837">Both subsections create a legal right to redress, and both subsections... and a party who can state a cause of action under either subsection is entitled to invoke the Federal court's jurisdiction under subsection (d).</text>

            <text syncTime="867.422" offset="3596665">You would expect the substantive provisions to be together, (a) and (f), and then (d) to follow both of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.993" offset="3626863">I think the answer to that is found in the legislative history of the act, that when Congress first provided the bills that... the initial bills, both the House and Senate bills, they provided a provision, subsection (a), that covered any person, including depository institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.304" offset="3692169">In the formulation of the bill... in the formulation of the legislation, Congress realized that the interbank question required special expertise, and it therefore added subsection (f) later, and also added language to (a) that excluded depository institutions from among the plaintiffs that might invoke that cause of action, so the placement actually reflects the genesis of the legislation, and that is the reason why it actually was added later in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.094" offset="3835320">It would have been better organized, but that still doesn't detract from the substance of the subsections that we're discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.448" offset="3860711">Now, the United States also disagrees with the court of appeals' conclusion that a agency tribunal should resolve interbank claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.339" offset="3904283">As this Court has indicated in cases such as Coit v. FSLIC, when Congress decides to allow agencies to adjudicate private disputes, it says so explicitly, and there is no such explicit statement in this statute at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.432" offset="3964678">The EFA act nowhere states that the board has the power or authority to adjudicate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.852" offset="3986308">The board's regulations reflect that limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.906" offset="4006579">The board has discerned within section 4010(f) a delegation of authority to establish liability rules, but it has not discerned any delegation of authority to establish standards or to establish... or to create a agency tribunal for adjudicating interbank disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.701" offset="4077736">Instead, the board's regulations recognize that the customary mechanism should be employed in this situation, and the customary mechanism is a judicial action in Federal or State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.224" offset="4119846">The United States also disagrees with respondent's suggestion that Congress intended that State courts would have exclusive jurisdiction over interbank disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.448" offset="4160701">Respondent acknowledges that Federal courts and State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over depositor claims, and there's no basis for drawing a distinction with regard to interbank claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.654" offset="4201557">Congress authorized the board to regulate the payment system in order to improve the interbank check collection process, and it would be quite anomalous to provide Federal court jurisdiction over depositor claims but not interbank claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.814" offset="4258190">There is simply no basis for providing a Federal forum for depositor claims no matter how small, while denying a Federal forum for interbank claims, no matter how large, and no matter what impact they might have on the interbank payment system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.464" offset="4368740">We believe that the jurisdiction question should be resolved within the four corners of the EFA act, because Congress has specifically addressed the question here, but 1331 jurisdiction would be consistent as well, and in fact section 1331 indicates the general tendency, at least since the Civil War, for Congress to provide a Federal forum to vindicate or address Federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.163" offset="4455571">In sum, we believe that the court of appeals erred in concluding that there was no Federal jurisdiction in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.253" offset="4603947">611(f), when it talks about rule-making in that title, is not talking about the kind of regulations that are involved in Regulation CC, which is the regulation that the suit sought to enforce, and I call the Court's attention to a portion of the legislative debate which is quoted at pages 17 and 18 of our brief.</text>
