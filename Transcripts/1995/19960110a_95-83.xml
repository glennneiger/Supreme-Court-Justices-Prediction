            <text syncTime="28.690" offset="254613">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.393" offset="269450">This case, after all the briefing on a wide range of issues, remains a statutory interpretation case, and the guidance that this Court has previously given on how to resolve such cases, particularly where Congress has provided strict... excuse me... direct indications of its intent in several ways, we think charts a very clear path for how the case should be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.082" offset="388151">Let me digress for just a moment to talk about the facts in this case that are at this stage undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.236" offset="412810">They are... this is still a pleading case, notwithstanding the many twists and turns that it has been through.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.401" offset="433395">The case concerns a small commercial property located on a street corner in Los Angeles that was owned by petitioners from 1963 to 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.259" offset="476863">The petitioners sold the property to respondent in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.631" offset="494312">Respondent had been a tenant on the property for about 10 years before that, since 1965, and had operated a Kentucky Fried Chicken store on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.658" offset="534436">In 1988 respondent decided that it would bulldoze that Kentucky Fried Chicken store and bulldoze also the strip mall that was alongside it and put a brand new store on the property... it was going to be a two-story, art deco, specially designed store... and in the course of that work discovered contamination on the property by refined petroleum product.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.223" offset="624716">That was in October 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.178" offset="636523">The respondent fully cleaned up the contamination in a matter of months, by March 1989, and gave notice to petitioners under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, what we call RCRA in shorthand, in May 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.374" offset="697336">It was not, though, until December 1991, more than 3 years after the contamination had been discovered, that respondent commenced its first action in State court alleging in toto 10 different causes of action, most of them sounding in common law, but two under State statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.928" offset="923556">After two successful demurrers by petitioners, that case went up on appeal to the State court and this action was filed in the Federal district court in LA alleging a single cause of action under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.945" offset="975592">That was in May 1992.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.308" offset="1113101">One has to do with the statutory requirement that an imminent and substantial endangerment be alleged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.064" offset="5024050">Number one, we as parties litigating and the court are limited by what Congress has provided, number one, and the scheme that Congress has provided provides a 90-day notice provision and then by implication in some situations would require a plaintiff to wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.157" offset="5092490">Secondly, the... by giving notice, there is some likelihood that particularly with a serious endangerment, that the EPA or the State or the alleged contaminator are going to come in and do some action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.014" offset="5143899">So, the argument advanced by respondents that we are going to have hazardous waste sites that are continuing to damage the environment and damage human health isn't necessarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.353" offset="5185277">And thirdly, within the statute itself... and the statute is contained in the appendix to respondent's brief... there is a provision and it's within the notice provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.551" offset="5226028">The notice says 90 days to the EPA, to the State, and to the contaminator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.234" offset="5240761">There is a provision that says, except where there is an allegation of a violation of subchapter 3 of the statute, and subchapter 3 is the portion of the statute that deals with hazardous waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.842" offset="5291230">So, presumably in a situation where you have hazardous waste, the plaintiff need not wait the 90 days if it is going in to remedy a hazardous waste situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.089" offset="5324144">So, those are my three responses to that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.659" offset="5426440">The initial and controlling issue in this case is whether a citizen plaintiff may seek relief under section 7002(a)(1)(B) of RCRA if there is no current endangerment at the time of suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.135" offset="5472415">We think the answer is clearly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.386" offset="5481401">Section 7002(a)(1)(B) provides that for judicial relief in response to specific activities, namely, the treatment, storage, and disposal of waste, that, quote, may present an imminent and substantial endangerment, end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.415" offset="5537512">The statute's use of the term "may present" indicates there must be a current endangerment at the time the suit is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.899" offset="5563426">That construction is born out by section 7002(b)(2)(A), the so-called notice provision, which requires the plaintiff to provide notice to the defendant and also to the other government agencies of the endangerment before filing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.490" offset="5625806">Respondent attempts to avoid that construction by arguing that the limiting clause requiring endangerment actually refers to a description of the hazardous waste and not to the antecedent activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.527" offset="5669901">The statute, however, will not afford that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.559" offset="5682022">Section 7002(b)(2)(B), which appears at the bottom of appendix page 3 of respondent's red brief, states that a citizen suit is precluded if the EPA is taking action in response to, quote, activities that may present the alleged endangerment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.730" offset="5750776">For that reason, it is clear that Congress was referring to the activities and not the waste when using the term "endangerment".</text>

            <text syncTime="1431.049" offset="5864043">For example, the statute makes reference to prospective remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.231" offset="5880761">It also provides a notice provision, as I discussed before, which provides for the elimination of the hazard and the avoidance of the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.645" offset="5958397">For example, House Report 198 describes the section 7002(a)(1)(B) remedy as a limited abatement remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.636" offset="12470410">So, my question is why timely suit wasn't commenced and cleanup commenced instead of saying, we'll do the whole thing and then we'll attempt to sue for past--</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel Romano</label>
            <text syncTime="3119.000" offset="12615860">Well, the Government makes... the Government's position is an interesting position because... we don't agree with that, obviously, and the reason for that is, is that the Government says, okay, if you find contamination, what you do is you have to start providing notices to people, assuming you can locate all of those people, before you do any cleanup activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.553" offset="12690048">Only you... only after you provided notice to all of the defendants can you then follow with the filing of a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.474" offset="12713767">We believe that such a reading of the statute will really contravene the congressional purpose in enacting the statute which is if you have a condition which is by definition the worst type of environmental contamination, what you would want to do is clean it up and then work out the details as to who is responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.468" offset="12781685">And I would say that principles of equity which govern the statute provide all of the necessary restrictions on enlarging this kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.082" offset="12820138">A district court on remand can decide and hold that we acted as an officious inter-meddlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.497" offset="12845842">A district court can decide that the costs that we've incurred were not necessary, and the district court may decide that we set on our rights and laches is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.311" offset="12881055">Certainly I don't think people will be bringing those kind of lawsuits without... if they didn't have any merit to them when they're facing with an attorney's fees and cost penalty in the event if they lose the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.590" offset="12922224">So, we believe that it is entirely appropriate for the Court to hold that a plaintiff may, in the limited circumstances where the contamination presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to health and the environment, do whatever is necessary to abate those conditions, and then sue under this statute to recover his costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.812" offset="12999129">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Zaimes</label>
            <text syncTime="3222.547" offset="13030058">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.630" offset="13042387">I'll cover only three points in that 2-minute time, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.600" offset="13058270">First, I had begun to discuss the cases, the line of cases, cited by respondent beginning with Porter v. Warner Holding and ending up more recently in Franklin v. Wynnette County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.139" offset="13100379">Those cases are cited for the proposition that there was a broad equitable power in Federal courts that can be called on in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.423" offset="13129532">And if we look at Porter as the beginning of that line, Porter was a case in which the words of the statute were much different from those here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.228" offset="13156699">Porter had a statute that allowed the court to issue an injunction or other order, significantly broader than what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.752" offset="13186792">And the court in that case looked at the legislative history and determined that the legislative history of that statute, the Emergency Price Control Act, was consistent with a reading that allowed the court, the lower court, to order the apartment owner to reimburse monies collected over the limit set by the Emergency Price Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.218" offset="13268712">In the Franklin case, there was no congressional guidance on the limitations of remedies under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.762" offset="13298910">Franklin arose under title 9 and the right of action had been found to be an implied right of action under Cannon v. City... University of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.588" offset="13334227">So, what the court determined was that there were four remedies available where Congress has not spoken as to the nature of the remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.311" offset="13361081">Since Congress hadn't even expressly indicated the right of action, they hadn't indicated the remedies either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.216" offset="13380725">Here we have an abundance of guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.158" offset="13392428">We have the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.819" offset="13403086">We have legislative history of this and predecessor statutes and even of the CERCLA amendments in 1986, all of which point to a very limited reading... limited availability of remedies under this citizen supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.688" offset="13450629">And we have a comparable statute, RCRA, which, as Justice Ginsburg notes, has a full discussion of the kinds of limitations that are placed on plaintiffs seeking to recover their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.817" offset="13503083">The second point I want to make with respect to the contumacious plaintiff example, we must remember that State law covers those contumacious plaintiffs in abundance, as does CERCLA in all but petroleum contamination cases.</text>
