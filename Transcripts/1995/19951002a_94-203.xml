            <text syncTime="13.861" offset="201239">This case presents the question whether section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a preclearing method of nominating candidates for the United States Senate that restricts the right to vote to persons who give 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.119" offset="254319">Under the facts of this case, if you don't pay 45, you have absolutely no say in how the Republican nominee for Senate in Virginia is selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.594" offset="292145">Section 5 requires the preclearance of all voting standards, practices or procedures, or prerequisites to voting, no matter how small the change, and was enacted to keep States and political parties from denying the recently won gains in registration under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.986" offset="361735">In Presley v. Etowah County Commission, this Court reaffirmed the broad scope of section 5, and identified once again a series of categories or typologies of case which require preclearance, and under the facts alleged in our complaint, this case falls within two of those typologies.</text>

            <text syncTime="71.878" offset="433310">Ms. Karlan, may I inquire, your brief suggests possibly three different theories of why section 5 might have been violated, and the first is that the 45 fee affects the process of selecting the nominee, and the second is that being a delegate to the convention is an elective party office, and third is the threat that the change from a primary election to a nominating convention required preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.852" offset="585239">Now, were either of those last two theories contained in the complaint, and were they raised below?</text>
            <text syncTime="118.658" offset="620452">Are they actually here, or do we just look at the 45 fee question?</text>

            <text syncTime="126.865" offset="653261">As Your Honor knows, this case came up on an expedited schedule with no discovery permitted to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.961" offset="681683">The result was that we found out when we received the affidavit of David Johnson contained in the Joint Appendix that the Republican Party had switched from a primary to a convention, and that this fee effective... this fee would only be possible were that change in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.289" offset="798920">Under our complaint, the facts of which must be taken as true for these purposes, we alleged that this was in effect a primary election itself, because as we alleged, and the district court assumed, anyone who pays 45 is entitled to go and cast a vote for a nominee.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.479" offset="1047710">Now, under Rule 15, the failure to amend the complaint need not keep the Court from reaching that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.013" offset="1069862">If this Court concludes that that's the central question, and that that issue wasn't sufficiently developed, then the proper response from the Court would be to reverse the judgment of the district court granting the motion to dismiss, and remand for further proceedings in which that issue can be expressly litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.694" offset="1132556">Now, there are two theories of section 5 alleged in the complaint under which, under the text of the Voting Rights Act, this practice is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.959" offset="1177591">The first of these is that the Republican Party's practices here, given the facts alleged, constitute a primary in and of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.536" offset="1211968">A primary election, after all, is an election in which individual voters who are adherents of a political party nominate a candidate by casting ballots.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.962" offset="1353657">Well, Justice Ginsburg, a political party under the circumstances of this case is a State actor in the same way that the Fifteenth Amendment by its terms simply guarantees the right to vote against abridgement or denial by a State, and has been held to cover political parties when they're engaged in the public nominating function.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.921" offset="1521467">The statute was by its terms specifically enacted to enforce the guarantees of the Fifteenth Amendment, and thereby it seems clear from the legislative history intended to reach political parties as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.759" offset="1568801">For example, we cite in our brief, Your Honor, the statement from the House subcommittee of the Judiciary that was responsible for the hearings on section 5 stating directly an election of delegates to a State party convention is covered, and a statement by Representative Bingham, the author of the language defining the term 14(c)(1), making clear that party canvases and caucuses that selected people who were involved in the nomination of candidates to public office were covered by the act because they were State actors.</text>

Wisconsin, and I would add to that the Eu case, and it is perfectly... it seems to me perfectly persuasive that this Court would say that everything that happens prior to an election, and the involvement of State apparatus, is First Amendment private activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.995" offset="13253790">I begin with one observation about what Mr. Getchell has told you today, which is, he tells you how the Republicans run their convention in Virginia, and how much it would cost, and how it should be operated, and how difficult it would be to preclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.962" offset="13305617">Those issues are not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.165" offset="13314499">The issue before this Court is here on a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.466" offset="13327665">If his argument depends on what the Virginia Republican Party actually does, then the appropriate judgment from this Court is a reversal and remand so that we can conduct discovery on what the Virginia party actually does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.233" offset="13374790">The second point I want to make is that the word State is, of course, ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.710" offset="13396628">It depends on a construction of State that draws on the Fifteenth Amendment cases which the Voting Rights Act was intended to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.493" offset="13427766">It understands what State action was, which is when political parties conduct their public nominating function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.097" offset="13454202">It relies on the Department of Justice's regulations, which this Court has always given great deference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.792" offset="13476981">The third point is about freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.743" offset="13488788">Justice Scalia, your arguments would depend... would be equally strong in the context of a primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.768" offset="13512925">If the Republican Party wanted to hold a primary election restricted to party members, and limit party membership to white voters only, then your argument would say they have that entitlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.754" offset="13564857">That might be correct, but Your Honor, the freedom of association point might be the same even if they did, and this court clearly has never taken that broad an approach.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3363.780" offset="13600906">I think the freedom to associate is not the freedom to have the Government pay for your association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.653" offset="13616370">I think once you get the Government in, paying for the primary, it's a different situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.885" offset="13633297">Now, in this case, there is no freedom of association claim, really, because if you look at the Republican call for the convention contained in the Joint Appendix, they allow all voters to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.143" offset="13674362">The only point they make is that they have some kind of interest in charging the 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.984" offset="13693692">That may be so, but that interest will only be trenched on by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act if the Department of Justice, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or this Court, concludes that that practice of charging the 45 has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.346" offset="13763178">At this point, their claim has to be that they would have the right to make people pay even if that excluded all black voters, or a disproportionate number of black voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.672" offset="13800481">Again, that is the issue to be determined in preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.286" offset="13810930">They have no First Amendment right that they have identified that would be trenched on by requiring preclearance in this case of this fee.</text>
