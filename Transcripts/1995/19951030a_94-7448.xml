            <text syncTime="17.604" offset="210635">These consolidated cases present the question of what it means to use or carry a firearm both during and in relation to a predicate drug trafficking offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.997" offset="248251">Section 925(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code makes that conduct a crime punishable by stiff, mandatory minimum sentences ranging from 5 years to life imprisonment without release.</text>

            <text syncTime="48.273" offset="333306">Their convictions were upheld by a narrowly divided D.C. Circuit sitting en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.437" offset="350024">The facts of the two cases, briefly stated, illustrate the broad reach given to section 924(c) by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.780" offset="379386">Candisha Robinson was convicted of using or carrying a small firearm known as a Derringer during and in relation to the predicate offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.398" offset="421809">Her section 924(c) conviction rested almost entirely on the fact that the Derringer was found unloaded and in a holster inside a locked footlocker in her bedroom closet.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.709" offset="971111">Moreover, what the Government really tries to do in this case is to ignore the word carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.444" offset="990024">I think the Government would like the Court to forget that the word carry is in the statute, and the reason for that is fairly simple, and that is that the Government's interpretation of the word use reads the word carry... carries out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.880" offset="1039761">According to the Government, whenever someone possesses a firearm so that it emboldens the possessor, or might be available for protection or security, that is a use, and we submit that whenever someone carries a firearm, the firearm is also available for use, and it also emboldens the person, so if the Government is right that Congress meant, by use, what it says, there really would have been no need to include the word carries in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.476" offset="1134115">This Court has repeatedly said that statutes must be read so that every word is given some effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.757" offset="5407330">Our position is that a firearm is used within the meaning of section 924(c) when the defendant puts or keeps it in a place where it is available to protect himself during drug trafficking operations and to embolden him to commit that offense, and we believe that, applying that definition, the evidence was sufficient in both of these cases to support petitioners' convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.105" offset="5520702">That's correct, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.687" offset="5526971">The jury was instructed that the use of the firearm had to be knowing and intentional, and the evidence in this case was sufficient for the jury to draw the inference that Roland Bailey had the 9 millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson automatic pistol in his trunk to protect his possession of cocaine and the proceeds of that drug trafficking, and that Candisha Robinson had a Derringer in a locked foot locker in her apartment bedroom, where drugs were kept and from which drugs were dealt both on the day of the drug trafficking crime that was charged in the indictment and on the previous day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.309" offset="5657479">So the jury could readily draw the inference that the defendant, or the defendant's agents perhaps, in Candisha Robinson's case, had put the firearm in that place so that it would be available if the need arose during the drug trafficking crime that was charged in section 924(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.506" offset="5830305">So the jury could readily infer that Candisha Robinson's agent, Parker, had gone to the trunk and had retrieved the cocaine from that place, and during that time had the gun available to him for the purpose of protecting him if the need arose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.059" offset="11476515">The Senate committee gave several examples in the report of how it thought the new statute would work, particularly in conjunction with the main purpose of the overhaul, which was to reverse the results in this Court's decisions in United States v. Simpson and United States v. Busic, which prohibited the application of 924(c) when the underlying predicate felony had its own enhancement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.415" offset="11573900">And in the course of discussing that change, Congress gave an example of how you could commit armed bank robbery and be subject also to the offense of using or carrying a firearm under section 924(c), and they added a footnote to make clear that even if you didn't do what is paradigmatically done to commit a bank robbery with a weapon, namely point it or shoot it, you could still be liable under the carrying prong, and the footnote... the footnote then continues to explain that the carrying prong was broadened because the unlawfully aspect of the former branch of liability under that provision had been deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.269" offset="11729381">None of that was devoted to determining what kinds of uses fell within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.202" offset="11753100">The basic point of the footnote was to explain the ways in which the statute had been broadened, and the final sentence of the footnote that I think you're referring to simply made clear that if there's no conjunction at all between the carrying of a firearm and the underlying offense, but it was just there coincidentally, then you're not liable at all, and I think read in context, that committee report doesn't shed much light at all on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.388" offset="11837841">What does shed light on the issue, I believe, is that when Congress amended the statute in 1984, it eliminated the qualifications on carrying liability, namely, unlawfully, and on using liability, namely, using to commit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.247" offset="11893221">They had given them different connotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.059" offset="11904506">And as for your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, about what it would mean if you put an ad in the paper and said, I'm selling a firearm, not used, that would also certainly be true if you had acquired the firearm because it had been bartered for drugs but it had been contained in shrink wrap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.766" offset="11955288">The meaning of the word use in section 924(c) is a broader meaning than that which could be applied in some other context.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.441" offset="12154027">I think that Justice O'Connor put her finger on a critical flaw in the Government's theory in this case, and that is that its interpretation of use reads the word carries out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.547" offset="12198435">I think the Government conceded that, that under its theory the word carries has no independent meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.270" offset="12225289">I mean, that's, you know, a handy rule of construction, but it's not rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.094" offset="12240649">I'm sure there are a lot of statutes, for example, that say kill or injure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.176" offset="12252979">No one shall kill or injure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.008" offset="12260293">Maybe the Endangered Species Act says that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.659" offset="12326853">So also here you could say, I not only mean the big thing, use, I even mean the lesser thing, carry but not use.</text>

            <text syncTime="3057.744" offset="12371262">Under the Government's theory of how the statute evolved, however, that's not what this statute meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.108" offset="12392682">In other words... and I think Justice Breyer's question pointed to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.460" offset="12406057">The Government also concedes in this case that prior to 1984 use and carry had, as they put it, a fundamentally different meaning than it had after 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.987" offset="12444195">That theory, we suggest, simply does not hold up if you look at the available evidence, and it's somewhat ironic, because the possession with intent... well, the drug trafficking offenses were... although they were included in the 1968 version of the statute, they were eliminated in 1984, and they were added back in 1986, and possession with intent to distribute was added in 1988.</text>
