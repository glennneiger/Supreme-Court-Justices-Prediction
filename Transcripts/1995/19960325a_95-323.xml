            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141560">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-323, United States v. Thomas R. Noland.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.906" offset="177087">Mr. Jones.</text>

          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="10.088" stopTime="163.918">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="10.088" offset="181893">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.172" offset="206239">This case involves the detailed statutory priorities that Congress has enacted to govern the payment of claims in bankruptcy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.947" offset="241348">Section 503(b)(1)(C) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that postpetition tax penalty claims are to be treated as administrative expenses of the debtor's estate with a first priority in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.486" offset="295473">The statute codifies this Court's 1966 decision in Nicholas v. United States, which reached precisely the same conclusion under prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.393" offset="335075">In this case, however, the court of appeals stated that it did not see the fairness or the justice of the first priority for postpetition tax penalty claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.799" offset="372691">The court stated that it would be more fair and more just for general commercial creditors to be paid in advance of tax petition claims and therefore reverse the statutory priorities, changing the priority for postpetition tax penalty claims from first to last.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.881" offset="444998">The court stated that its restructuring of the statutory priorities was justified by the principles of equitable subordination that Congress codified in 1978 as section 510(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, but the principles of equitable subordination do not confer such a broad power of statutory nullification on bankruptcy courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.504" offset="531516">The principles of equitable subordination were designed to provide a remedy for the individual misconduct of a creditor in acquiring or pursuing his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.430" offset="567251">As this Court stated in the Comstock case, the doctrine deprives the wrongdoer of the fruits of his wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.614" offset="592016">Prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code, the courts have consistently held that in the absence of creditor misconduct, courts were not permitted under the principles of equitable subordination to simply disregard a statutory priority that they disagreed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.373" offset="651052">They were not permitted to say, as the court said in this case, that the statutory priority is a mistake and will not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.230" offset="682399">The court of appeals recognized in this case that under the traditional judge made principles of equitable subordination, that doctrine served the limited function of providing a guarantee against creditor misconduct, but the court reasoned that when Congress codified these principles in 1978, Congress somehow radically altered the scope of the doctrine, and that it is now appropriate for the court to disregard a statutory priority when the court concludes that it is just to do so.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="163.918" offset="797129">Mr. Jones, do you agree that a tax penalty claim in theory could be subordinated if there were some sufficient reason for finding fault with the Government... misconduct?</text>

          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="180.839" stopTime="209.987">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="180.839" offset="864838">I agree that the principles of equitable subordination can apply to all claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.753" offset="880512">Our understanding of those principles and the understanding that this Court stated in the Comstock case and that all other courts had stated prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code was that what those principles did was to prevent a creditor from acquiring or pursuing a claim based upon misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.991" offset="945504">The legislative history of the Bankruptcy Code states, but we think it is obvious, that these principles of equitable subordination would rarely apply to a tax claim, but if--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="209.987" offset="981449">Yes, but I took your position basically to be that in a particular case, no equitable subordination absent a showing of inequitable conduct.</text>

          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="223.237" stopTime="225.939">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="223.237" offset="1034425">--That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.309" offset="1038709">That is what the doctrine is designed--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="225.939" offset="1045292">And in theory the Government could engage in such conduct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="229.011" stopTime="245.351">

            <text syncTime="231.212" offset="1066399">Again, I think it would be rare that we could think of a situation where that would happen, and the Senate report on this bill made that very point, but certainly, if the United States acquired a claim through misconduct, it would be subject to equitable subordination.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="245.351" stopTime="269.027">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="245.351" offset="1122928">Of course, those of us who look to legislative history have got one problem from your standpoint, and that is, it may be that the person who made the statement about the intent was wrong in describing what courts had been doing, but the intent still seems to be there, and what is the tie breaker?</text>
            <text syncTime="263.954" offset="1197325">Do we look to the person's mistake, or to the person's intent in making the statement?</text>

          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="269.027" stopTime="350.171">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="269.027" offset="1217596">Well, let me... that is... the court of appeals relied on what you're referring to, which is a fragment of a single sentence of the floor statements of the sponsors of the bill, but let's consider that statement in its context.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.814" offset="1268796">The sponsors made several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.546" offset="1279663">First, they pointed out that the principles of equitable subordination that were being codified were those expressed in existing case law, and certainly that represents an intent to incorporate, not to significantly alter the preexisting doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.346" offset="1338909">Second, the sponsors stated that under existing case law, the principles of equitable subordination served as a remedy for creditor misconduct much in the same way that this court had said in the Comstock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.574" offset="1383839">Now, the third thing they said, and this is the point that the court of appeals relied on, was that the principles of equitable subordination would also permit subordination of a claim of a status susceptible to subordination such as a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.294" offset="1438696">That statement was not a correct description of existing case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.545" offset="1455728">There was literally no case law of that type prior to the adoption of the Bankruptcy Code and, indeed, as I have already mentioned, in 1966 in the Nicholas case this Court held that postpetition tax penalty claims were entitled to a first priority in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.594" offset="1511839">The Senate report does not contain the misstatement that is in this fragment of the sentence from the floor statements.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="350.171" stopTime="360.028">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="350.171" offset="1542141">But isn't there also a statement in that report that is not simply case law frozen as of a point in time but case law as further developed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="360.028" stopTime="404.524">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="360.028" offset="1581638">We certainly agree that when Congress codified these principles it intended for the courts to continue developing them, and it is appropriate for the courts to continue devising rules that guard against creditor misconduct and that deprive the wrongdoer of the fruits of its wrong, but nothing in those ordinary, equitable principles provide any support for the novel contention that a court in equity can simply disregard a statute that it disagrees with.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.493" offset="1683516">As the Ninth Circuit said in the Stebbins case, neither general equitable principles nor the specific principles of equitable subordination authorize a court to simply say a statutory priority is a mistake and will not be enforced, and that is in essence exactly what the court of appeals held in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.524" offset="1759584">The same statement, Mr. Jones, appears... I mean, it was obviously carefully drawn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.598" offset="1775885">It appears verbatim in both the House and the Senate, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="414.562" offset="1799709">I mean, it's almost like a committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.073" offset="1809844">The floor leader in both chambers reads exactly the same text.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.837" offset="1832832">Do you want to--</text>

            <text syncTime="431.925" offset="1869194">--insofar as it shows what the expectation or the intent of Congress is concerned, it seems to Congress expected and intended that a penalty would be subject to this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.044" offset="1909736">Congress is not in the business of figuring out what case law says.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.724" offset="1924365">It is in the business of figuring out what disposition should be made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="450.038" offset="1941710">I think read in its entirety, which, of course, if we're going to read the legislative history we have to do that, read in its entirety, what the history manifests is an intent to incorporate existing case law and then a misdescription of one aspect of that case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.009" offset="2013495">The intent to incorporate existing case law is manifest in the Senate report which doesn't contain the misdescription of the existing case law, but beyond the question of intent and description is just the simple logic of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.180" offset="2074203">It is improbable that Congress intended, by adopting such a broad concept of equitable subordination, to have rendered all of its substantive statutory priorities essentially meaningless, which is a construction that would result from the opinion in this case, and let me see if I can explain that.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.666" offset="2372208">I suppose you could say that's not a case of malicious wrongdoing, but it would be a case in which the taxpayer relied detrimentally on the Government and then ends up with perhaps a nonwaivable penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.314" offset="2418811">That would be a case, I suppose, in which there could be subordination.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.042" offset="2461651">I will agree with you that if there was a situation where an authorized representative of the United States had taken some action that was unfair to other creditors in achieving a preference for a Government claim that wouldn't otherwise have been factually appropriate, that would be the kind of context in which equitable subordination might apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.736" offset="2544407">I think actually equitable subordination is a broad doctrine when it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.051" offset="2569694">It broadly is designed to prevent misconduct in any of its manners of manifestation, and we don't intend to suggest that it doesn't have this broad objective, but we think it reasonably clear it doesn't have the broad objective of making the statutory priorities essentially meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.802" offset="2640747">It is obvious, we think, that if the only effective priority rule in bankruptcy cases turned on a concept as elastic as fairness, that extraordinary uncertainty would exist for all creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.398" offset="2691111">For example, on grounds of fairness should a tort claim for pain and suffering be subordinated on a rationale applied in this case that it's not a pecuniary loss resulting from an extension of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.258" offset="2742520">What do we make of the fifth priority for claims based upon stored grain?</text>

            <text syncTime="660.215" offset="2782331">Now, these kinds of categorical determinations are exactly what Congress does when it enacts these statutory priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.318" offset="2810752">With respect to tax penalty claims alone, Congress has four separate rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.772" offset="2832590">Postpetition tax penalty claims are given a first priority, some types of prepetition tax penalty claims have a seventh priority, other types of prepetition tax penalty claims are treated as general unsecured claims in a Chapter 11 and are subordinated to general unsecured claims in a Chapter 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.061" offset="5805743">This is a Chapter 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.912" offset="5817132">It is critical to remember that fact, because section 726 of the Bankruptcy Code, which controls the order of distribution in Chapter 7 cases, in order to assure the equality to all creditors begins with the clause, except as provided in section 510 of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.076" offset="5893828">What the Government seeks to do is to effectively eliminate that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.978" offset="5913472">It also seeks to eliminate the distinction between nonpecuniary loss tax penalties, which are the types of penalties which we have in this case, from pecuniary loss tax penalty claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.898" offset="5965090">The difference is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.349" offset="5974912">In a prepetition context, for example, section 726(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code expressly subordinates nonpecuniary loss tax penalty claims to the claims of general unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.467" offset="6027366">In this particular case, we have a plan that was confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.389" offset="6043039">The vast majority of the penalties in issue arose very near the time of confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.962" offset="6065400">There was no time for anybody to respond to determine... for the creditors to react and say, gee, we ought to stop this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.078" offset="6093821">When the case converted, the tax was owed, the penalties were owed, but these are not for financial loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.323" offset="6118794">These are penalties that are punitive, or to deter, and as the Court stated unanimously in Simonson v. Granquist, the majority of the Court stated that the purpose of penalties is to punish, and the burden would fall on the innocent creditors in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.202" offset="6178353">The dissent agreed with that proposition, that the punitive aspect of penalties was contrary to the intent of the Bankruptcy Code and the equality of distribution which was contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.371" offset="6226941">The Bankruptcy Code also distinguishes between nonpecuniary and pecuniary loss penalties in section 507(a), now (8), formerly (7), which deals with the priority to be accorded to prepetition tax penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.697" offset="6276260">In the context of section 503(b)(1)(C), where the Court... where the statute refers to penalties, it does not draw that fine line distinction, because Congress did not have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.565" offset="6323803">By section 726, they expressly made 510 applicable to those penalties and stated that they may be subordinated under section 510.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.957" offset="9325377">The second question that I had is just as technical, and I want to know how it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.239" offset="9342513">Imagine that you are in Chapter 11, and we don't really have a lot of money, but we're trying to struggle to keep the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.545" offset="9379712">I would imagine that the president of the company and the executives who are there running it ought to pay their taxes, and if they don't, I don't know why they shouldn't have to pay penalties the same as anybody else, and I don't know why that isn't an administrative expense like anything else, postpetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.976" offset="9441361">But I did imagine from what you're saying that there could be a case where we're finding it hard to get unanimous agreement among unsecured creditors, and the bankruptcy judge works out that if I could subordinate the penalty on the tax below the unsecured creditors there will be enough money for them under a section 7, and therefore I don't need the unanimity, and that might be why he wants to subordinate in the Chapter 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.551" offset="9539686">He wants the authority to have subordinated the penalty in the hypothetical Chapter 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.094" offset="9557867">Now, I raise that to know if that's technically right, or if it's not, just say no, and I will erase it from my mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.904" offset="9873113">What we are expressing is that the penalties are subordinated not because they're just nonpecuniary loss, but in this particular context it is a corporate debtor, it is a debtor in Chapter 7, and there are insufficient funds to go around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.986" offset="9937478">Now, the degree of subordination that the bankruptcy court stated subordinate to general unsecured claims, if that is error would be harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.670" offset="9960153">The court could have said, just subordinate the nonpecuniary loss penalty to other administrative expense pecuniary loss claims, so there is a degree, a range of discretion that can be exercised by the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.370" offset="10015010">The creditor body may be comprised primarily of shareholders who made loans to the corporation and who are also in control, and that might be another context where the court would feel that it is not appropriate to subordinate, but the court starts with the position that the claim has priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.709" offset="10076345">It is up to the moving party to establish that it is entitled to subordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.224" offset="10102363">Perhaps the correct remedy here would have been for the Internal Revenue Service to have asked for the tax to be subordinated, because the responsible officers under section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code are responsible for the tax and interest, but it does not state that they're responsible for the penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.985" offset="10177491">So there's no deterrent effect on section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code, which is really what this particular case and these particular taxes are about, for the officers to not go ahead and not pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.055" offset="10233707">What do they care?</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.665" offset="10236215">They don't have to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.016" offset="10237573">It's the creditors, the innocent creditors who are giving value to the debtor, who are trying to assist the corporation in reorganizing, who find out after the debtor fails to pay taxes that they are now also being hit with this large penalty, a penalty for which the Internal Revenue Service gave nothing, but which the statute says, debtor, if you do something wrong, you will be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.520" offset="10323568">The taxpayer is the party to be punished, but in this particular case it is not the taxpayer that bears the burden of that punishment, it is the innocent creditors, the same creditors which this Court recognized in Simonson v. Granquist, both the majority and dissenting opinions recognized.</text>
