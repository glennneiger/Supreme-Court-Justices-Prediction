            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="11.410" offset="190284">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="15.602" offset="207106">VMI, the Virginia Military Institute, was established by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1839 as a State college for young men between the ages of 16 and 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.489" offset="254649">Initially, its students were cadets who were assigned to guard the State militia arsenal in Lexington, Virginia, where VMI is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.294" offset="289862">VMI since that time has remained a State institution and in 1989-'90, for example, it contributed, the State contributed about $10 million to VMI's operating budget, that's about 35 percent of the budget, and the Board of Visitors of VMI, which decides things like its admissions policy, is appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.370" offset="382127">Although it has remained a State institution in that way it has also, at the same time, enormously broadened its educational mission so that it's no longer just a place to produce cadets for the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.159" offset="437297">Indeed, today only about 15 percent of VMI graduates enter the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.932" offset="456419">VMI graduates enter the professions, law, medicine, engineering quite a lot, public service quite a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.188" offset="485467">While restricting VMI to men might have been inevitable, indeed required at the time VMI was initially established because the military at that time was all male, as VMI's mission has broadened that's obviously no longer true.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.410" offset="566342">VMI nevertheless has continued only to admit men, and continues only to admit men until this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.885" offset="592256">During the 150 years or more of VMI's existence, it has developed what everyone concedes is a unique, adversative method of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.713" offset="639485">It is... was developed in an all male context, and it is stereotypically a male form of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.267" offset="669787">It emphasizes adversity, it emphasizes competition, it emphasizes standing up to stress, it emphasizes the development of strong character in the face of adversity, of self reliance, of self confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.325" offset="726003">The VMI degree has, through that unique method, become a very valuable asset in two ways, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.662" offset="763306">First of all, it demonstrates that the person who has the degree has succeeded in a highly adversative environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.556" offset="794862">Many people value that when looking for leaders and looking for people to hire.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.542" offset="4994829">And I thought, what if a State set up a State law school in 1839, all for men, because at that time only men could be lawyers, and over 150 years it developed an extremely adversative method of legal education, the toughest kind of Socratic teaching, tremendous time pressures, tremendous pressures in exams, tremendous combativeness by the faculty, tremendous competitiveness among the students, and developed a reputation for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.457" offset="5094512">And the graduates of that school... and it was a place that was known as hard to succeed at, and a third or so of the people flunked out in the first year, and the graduates of that school who survived that process became known as expert leading lawyers and judges in that State and Nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.938" offset="5156475">And then as women came into the legal profession and started to apply to the school, to ask it to change its admission policy, the school made a judgment that most women really wouldn't be comfortable in this environment, and the faculty would have trouble cross examining them in the same way they cross examine women, and other students would have difficulty relating to them in the same competitive way, and so it's better not to let women into the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.913" offset="5248321">What we'll do is, we'll set up a new women's law school, and it won't have the tough Socratic method, it will have a much warmer, a much more embracing environment, and it won't have large classes with a lot of pressure, it will have seminars, and it won't have tough exams, it will have papers, and things like that--</text>
