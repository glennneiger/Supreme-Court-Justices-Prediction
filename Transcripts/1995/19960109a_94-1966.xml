            <text syncTime="8.248" offset="177324">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="15.401" offset="205954">This case presents several questions regarding whether and under what circumstances the President is permitted to create aggravating factors for military capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.757" offset="243362">In this Court we have presented several challenges to the creation of these factors, ranging from the most broad to this is a nondelegatable power to the most narrow, that Congress failed to provide the President with an intelligible principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.686" offset="295084">In considering all of these issues, however, some historical perspective is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.429" offset="314101">In Article I, section 8, clause 14, the Framers gave to Congress and not the President the plenary power to make rules for the Government regulation of the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.846" offset="359763">They did so for a reason and from a very historical vantage point.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.479" offset="374288">Not only were they distrustful of executive control of the military in general, but they were wary of broad court martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.614" offset="402813">The Framers and those who influenced their political thought had lived under martial law and had witnessed and suffered through the abuses of military power.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="73.059" offset="436563">Mr. Lowenfield, before you go too much further... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.253" offset="457357">Mr. Blume.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.054" offset="460596">I'm thinking of the case I'm going to ask you about.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.255" offset="469373">There... most of your argument is based on separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.009" offset="496436">There is another separation of powers issue it seems to me and that is the standing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.792" offset="523499">Even if we assume that the President has no power to specify what crimes shall be subject to the death penalty, Congress itself in 10 U.S.C., section 918 has specified two.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.331" offset="581700">It has specifically said that anyone who unlawfully kills a human being when he, number one, has a premeditated design to kill, and number four, is engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of burglary, sodomy, rape, robbery or aggravated arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.063" offset="640632">In those two instances, Congress has said he shall suffer death or imprisonment for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.747" offset="663306">Now, it seems to me that if that specification is sufficient, it doesn't matter whether or not the President has authority to add additional aggravating circumstances so long as those two suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.025" offset="720462">Is it clear that those two alone don't suffice?</text>
            <text syncTime="146.387" offset="729866">Premeditated design to kill or killing in the perpetration of those particular crimes?</text>

            <text syncTime="152.260" offset="753377">Yes, Justice Scalia, I think it's clear that does not suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.724" offset="767274">All article 118 is... it sets forth four theories under which you can be found guilty of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.765" offset="787440">One is premeditated and number four is a felony murder theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.341" offset="813772">No, it's quite different because the way 918... this is on page 145 of the joint appendix, by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.136" offset="844910">The way 918 ends is, in all four of those situations specified he's guilty of murder and shall suffer such punishment as a court martial may direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.842" offset="883675">And if it ended there, then you would possibly be into the argument that you want to make to us whether the President has the authority to specify what shall obtain the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.708" offset="919202">It doesn't end there, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.120" offset="924844">And it says, except that if found guilty under clause 1 or 4, he shall suffer death or imprisonment for life as a court martial may direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.026" offset="960475">Now, why isn't that an adequate specification whether or not the President adds additional ones?</text>

            <text syncTime="226.850" offset="1051799">All 118 does is sets forth a set of four theories.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.902" offset="12032005">I should also say that what we have here is the combined judgment of not only the President of the United States, as advised by the Justice Department and the Secretary of Defense when he promulgated rule 1004, but also the Court of Military Appeals in Matthews itself and later in Curtis and finally by Congress a year after the promulgation of rule 1004 when Congress enacted the special espionage provision.</text>
