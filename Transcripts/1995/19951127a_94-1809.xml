            <text syncTime="3157.597" offset="12769599">That same concession is made by the Ninth Circuit in its opinion, and that appears in the petitioner's appendix at page 38 and footnote 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.335" offset="12816619">Manifestly, if Federal claims can be dismissed in the context of an individual action or in a derivative action, then there's no Federal supremacy issue here, and there's also no Federal preemption issue here.</text>
