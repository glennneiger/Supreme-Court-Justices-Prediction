            <text syncTime="12.208" offset="192195">This case involves a challenge to the authority of a State to allocate certain law making power among its State and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.164" offset="219989">Colorado's Amendment 2 reserves to the State the decision of whether to extend special protections under State law on the basis of homosexual or bisexual conduct or orientation.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.870" offset="258859">The sole question here is whether in this facial challenge that statewide reservation of authority should be nullified under this Court's prior holdings in James v. Valtierra and Hunter v. Erickson.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.678" offset="306089">That question can be authoritatively resolved for two core reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.181" offset="320090">First, the logic and holding of James is indistinguishable and controls here.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.254" offset="340361">Secondly, the rationality of the substantive policy judgment that has so far motivated Congress and other States in deciding not to extend title VII protections or other... to homosexuals and bisexuals similarly supports the decision of Colorado to reserve that question to itself on a statewide basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.429" offset="553102">Your Honor, in James v. Valtierra the Court was presented with a question involving a State constitutional amendment that also identified a classification... in that case, low income persons... and in analyzing the question there, the Court fundamentally looked at whether Hunter v. Erickson should extend beyond the specific racial context in which it was decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.400" offset="688939">Here, the classification is just adopted for its own sake, with reference to all purposes of the law, so James doesn't work.</text>
