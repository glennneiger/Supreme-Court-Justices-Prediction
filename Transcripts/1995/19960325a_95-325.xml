            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="21.875" offset="229556">Well, I take comfort in the thought that we're all suffering together here.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.428" offset="251708">This case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.089" offset="262366">The first question is whether the tax imposed by section 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code is within the priority that Congress has established for excise taxes in section 507(a)(7)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.090" offset="322447">The second question is whether, if this tax is not entitled to that statutory priority, it may then be subordinated to the claims of general unsecured creditors under the principles of equitable subordination that we've been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.991" offset="378036">I would like to briefly discuss the second question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.223" offset="390888">The case that was just argued could be said to stand, or present the question of whether the principles of equitable subordination on grounds of fairness alone, would permit a court to deviate from what is known as the absolute priority rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.355" offset="447417">That rule, as discussed by this Court in the Norwest Bank case, is that all claims of a higher priority have to be paid before any claim of a lower priority is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.669" offset="480749">In the case that was just argued, the higher priority was the first priority for postpetition tax penalty claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.932" offset="501752">This case, the second question in this case, if it is reached, could be said to present the question of whether the principles of equitable subordination permit a court, again on grounds of fairness alone, to deviate from what is called the equality of distribution rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.003" offset="562042">That rule, as discussed by this Court in the Begier case, is that all claims of the same rank must be paid pro rata, without discrimination among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.419" offset="599763">Now, because, in our view, the principles of equitable subordination are the same in both contexts, and in the absence of creditor misconduct don't permit subordination either of claims of the same or of a different rank, the court of appeals erred in this case in subordinating the innocent claim of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.011" offset="674056">Thus, if the court was right that the claim of the United States didn't have a statutory priority, it was wrong in then saying that the innocent claim of the United States could be subordinated to other general, unsecured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.249" offset="727032">That violates the principle of equality of distribution and it also--</text>

            <text syncTime="157.106" offset="770500">The relief that we would be entitled to would be to be treated pro rata with other general unsecured claims, if we're not a priority claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.780" offset="797145">Now, the first question in this case is whether we are a priority claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.813" offset="817311">Section 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted in 1974 as part of ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.429" offset="1039770">Subtitles B through E of the Internal Revenue Code are all excise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.523" offset="1056175">There's the estate taxes, employment taxes, miscellaneous excise taxes, alcohol and tobacco taxes... Congress has a lot of excise taxes, but the common feature, what you can see if you go through them, is there are two common features.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.562" offset="1116256">They're not universally present, but they're the common characteristics of excises, and those are that it is imposed upon a specific act or event, in this case the act of maintaining an underfunded pension plan, and second is that it's imposed of a portion of the value of that act or event, in this case a portion of the value of the underfunding.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.824" offset="1193370">Now, 4 years after this tax was enacted, Congress, in restructuring the Bankruptcy Code, enacted 507(a)(7)(E), which provides a specific, unqualified priority for any State, Federal, or local excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.947" offset="1257840">The court of appeals reasoned in this case that that priority could not reach this tax, because this tax was designed to enforce another law.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.091" offset="1294411">It was designed to deter the violation of another law, and the court regarded it as a penalty, and as a penalty the court concluded it wouldn't come within the priority for an excise tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.208" offset="12922872">The claim that a tax that effects a penalty loses its priority was exactly what this Court rejected in United States v. New York under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.226" offset="12962996">The Bankruptcy Code simply makes it easier to understand that that's the correct answer, because knowing full well that many of its excises are penalty or regulatory in nature, Congress adopted an unqualified priority for excise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.793" offset="13017226">We have to establish only that it's an excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.986" offset="13029974">Whether it's also regarded as a penalty is not relevant for applying the plain language of the statute, and the court held in United States v. New York it was not relevant under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
