            <text syncTime="3363.678" offset="13600103">--It's not Pickering in the sense, Your Honor, that the inherent interest underlying Pickering, the Government's interest in coworker relationship, in supervisory discipline, and in the functioning of a work place where they're all Government employees there, that is a weight that is given a lot of deference in Pickering.</text>
