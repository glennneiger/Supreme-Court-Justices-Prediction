            <text syncTime="78.412" offset="477694">But in any event, the Court became aware of the absence of compactness, which leads into another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.288" offset="505175">There was a discussion of the difference between narrow tailoring and broad tailoring.</text>

            <text syncTime="94.803" offset="543313">And I'd like to make one other point, just to explain why we are here, and perhaps it reflects a rather naive understanding of the Constitution, of the Equal Protection Clause, but my impression has been that if there were two water fountains over there, one of which said African American, and another of which said, women, and another over here which said male, and said white, and if that in effect was here, with the signs, that I would be perfectly entitled to go to any one of those four fountains and drink the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.038" offset="692211">The water would be the same everywhere, but the Court nor other public body, no State, no Federal body could approve racial classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.195" offset="728887">And the reason we're here is because this map reflects a redistricting plan which, in effect, is a racial classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.175" offset="1164819">Which is to say that Professor Shimm is assigned to the 12th District at least in part because of the racial determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.723" offset="1946925">That is, what was said 2 1/2 years ago when we were here, and what's happened in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.367" offset="1977540">When I argued the case 2 1/2 years ago the counsel for the State appellee, and this is pointed out in our brief on page 4, said this case is about the legal significance of two facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.229" offset="2040966">First, the North Carolina General Assembly intentionally created two majority minority congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.652" offset="2070641">Second, the General Assembly did so for the purpose of complying with section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and of securing preclearance of its congressional reapportionment plan from the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.654" offset="2134693">In response to a question from the Court, the same counsel stated... he's not here this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.867" offset="2163532">There's a different counsel for the State, but he presumably spoke with authority... there's no dispute here over what the State's purpose is.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.813" offset="2191327">There's a dispute over how to characterize it legally, but we're not in disagreement about what the State legislature was trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.797" offset="2223300">Then again, and this is quoted on page 27 of our brief in the footnote, counsel for the State defendant stated to the Court the determining factor in this case is that North Carolina is subject to section 5 preclearance, and then later, section 2 may, depending upon the particular demographics and the situation of the State, require majority minority districting, but once again, that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.817" offset="2343359">So we were here 2 1/2 years ago thinking the case had to do with whether or not section 5 was involved, and the State put forth what we characterized as the Nuremberg defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.163" offset="2388708">The Department of Justice made us do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.415" offset="5113697">I can see the... well, if you want to have Democrats control or Republicans, or whatever it is, look at the registration of those, you may know that there's a heavy Democratic registration, say in North Carolina where 95 percent of the African Americans are registered as black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.687" offset="5186840">You may know that where there's a 95... a heavy Democratic registration there probably is a very substantial African American population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.772" offset="5215157">So what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.671" offset="5218709">But what I am concerned about, and perhaps this is because of my reading or misreading of the peremptory challenges cases, my understanding is that if I look at a juror, I have a peremptory challenge, and I say, that juror is black, therefore I don't want him in this particular case, or that juror is a woman and I don't want her in that particular case, and I use a stereotype, and I use a classification, that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.500" offset="5326020">If, on the other hand, as in the Hernandez case where you were dealing, as I recall, with peremptory challenges, I say, this Hispanic may be interpreting for himself or herself the testimony being given, rather than going through an interpreter, then I can challenge him off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.921" offset="5391744">It's... as we view it, and we perhaps take Hirabayashi and the later cases too seriously, but we really take it very seriously that racial classifications are odious and are subject to stricture.</text>

            <text syncTime="3672.374" offset="14853609">Indeed, the charge is made that it is very much in the political interests of some people to aggregate all blacks into one or two districts so that the rest of the districts can ignore their interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="4115.242" offset="16625024">Let me start with the question that has occupied the Court during much of this argument, and that is the question of whether, if the Gingles factors are satisfied so that there's a compelling interest in satisfying section 2 by drawing minority majority districts, whether the State can then locate those districts anywhere in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.225" offset="16700989">It is not our position that the State can locate them anywhere in the State, and in this case the State did not locate them anywhere in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.912" offset="16727738">The District 12 which was ultimately drawn here contains two areas, the Charlotte area here, and the Durham area here, which are... contain a substantial part of the black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.627" offset="16774549">In this district Charlotte alone contains a little over 30 percent of the black population in this district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.310" offset="16793358">Durham contains some more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.483" offset="16797955">Both of those areas were in a compact district in the Shaw II plan that's in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.987" offset="16828048">It's this plan here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.109" offset="16840482">Charlotte was in this district, and Durham was in this district, so there's a substantial overlap between those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.804" offset="16867336">And in addition, another limiting criterion, Justice Kennedy, is that the district must be placed in an area so that the majority of the black population in the district has been a victim of the polarized voting that invoked section 2, and a majority of that population is politically cohesive with other minorities in the State who have been the victims of that, and the findings of fact in this case, which are amply supported by the evidence, are that that was exactly true here.</text>
