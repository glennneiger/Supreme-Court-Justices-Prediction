            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="196370">The outcome of this case will depend on three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.795" offset="216014">First, the North Carolina tax upon the intangible value of stock discriminates, both facially and in actual operation, against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.602" offset="267214">Second, there is no defense to this discrimination either under the compensating tax defense or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.510" offset="306920">Thirdly, this case is not controlled by the 1912 decision in Darnell v. Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.664" offset="339521">First, I would like to speak to the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.135" offset="357389">That the discrimination in the tax is facial is admitted either explicitly or implicitly by the decision of the North Carolina supreme court and by the State in its brief before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.310" offset="414022">Were it not for that facial discrimination, there would not be necessary the attempt to prove the compensatory tax defense which both the State supreme court and the State before this Court have argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.202" offset="465640">Not only is there facial discrimination against interstate commerce, but perhaps more importantly, this tax--</text>

            <text syncTime="100.014" offset="540873">It's discrimination against the stock ownership, not against the activity, is what I'm saying.</text>

Darnell Company, which in fact was the same corporation involved in the Darnell case, the company that receives logs shipped from another State and was taxed in that case differently from logs that it had received from the taxing State, while it might not have been the outside shipper of the logs, it suffered the first impact of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.391" offset="730417">Well, there it was a tax on logs which were owned by the in-State company, but we've had many cases before this Court where the party who was objecting before this Court was not the party dealing in interstate commerce but was just a local party who had dealt with someone who was in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.394" offset="842430">Forget all the gradations of, you know, half... just the extreme polar cases.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="182.131" offset="869389">And what is the closest case on that point, in your view?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jasper L. Cummings, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="185.333" offset="882137">The closest case to the facts in this case, I believe, is Westinghouse v. Tully, the 1984 decision of this Court written, I believe, by Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.408" offset="934486">Westinghouse v. Tully also involved the tax on a shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.312" offset="954130">The shareholder in that case was Westinghouse Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.180" offset="965519">It had a subsidiary that was a DISC, a domestic international sales corporation, and the tax at issue was the parent's franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.019" offset="1000942">The franchise tax was computed in a way that increased the parent's franchise tax as the subsidiaries exports through the ports of other States increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.910" offset="1052455">It didn't matter that the exports through the ports of the State of New York stayed the same, but if the subsidiary did more activity in interstate commerce, the shareholders' franchise tax went up.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.087" offset="1105222">We submit that that same type of discrimination exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.991" offset="1124762">Under the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="247.523" stopTime="252.894">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="247.523" offset="1130927">The Court... are you saying the Court struck down the tax in Westinghouse v. Tully?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jasper_l_cummings_jr" startTime="252.894" stopTime="349.808">
            <label>Mr. Jasper L. Cummings, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="252.894" offset="1152452">--Yes, Your Honor, the Court struck down the tax on the shareholder, which was a franchise tax in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.798" offset="1171991">So we have here both the facial discrimination, which as I indicated was admitted both in the brief and by the North Carolina supreme court, we have the actual penalty against interstate commerce, in that here the corporation could do the same amount of business in the State of North Carolina but could expand its business in interstate commerce and as a result of that the shareholders' stock tax will go up.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.049" offset="1281079">So therefore the two taxes, the stock tax which my client has paid and the corporate income tax which is said to be a compensatory tax, which we will get to in a minute, are not in this case mutually exclusive proxies for each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.208" offset="1341683">This is not an either-or case.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.841" offset="1348161">This is not a situation where one tax goes down and the other tax goes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.779" offset="1363939">Just as in Westinghouse v. Tully, or by analogy to that, the tax paid by the corporation to North Carolina could remain the same, the shareholders' tax could go up just because the subsidiary of the corporation had increased this interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.372" offset="1422349">Having shown both actual and facial discrimination against interstate commerce, we turn to the compensating tax defense on which the State and the North Carolina supreme court primarily relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.612" offset="1475325">First, it is important to notice that the compensating tax defense has never been allowed to impose an actual penalty on interstate commerce by its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.487" offset="1518793">As I have illustrated, it would do so if it were allowed to be applied in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="349.808" offset="1540109">Your theory of the penalty is the theory that, in effect, the investment will be siphoned out of interstate commerce and into investment in corporations that do business solely intrastate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jasper_l_cummings_jr" startTime="361.882" stopTime="362.699">

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="362.699" offset="1591622">Is that argument affected by the fact that, by and large, the investment market is a national investment market?</text>
            <text syncTime="369.971" offset="1620670">I mean, if the stock were being sold entirely in the State, your argument would be a very strong one.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.958" offset="1652644">Stock characteristically, though, is sold on national markets, and is this fact, this tendency to favor intra rather than interstate investment in effect going to be diluted almost to the point of the incidental by the fact that we have a national market, and that the investor in Oregon isn't going to be worrying about this?</text>

            <text syncTime="400.907" offset="1744491">Your Honor, it might be somewhat invested.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.793" offset="1755985">I can say from personal experience that I know from many persons in North Carolina they like to invest in corporations like CP&amp;L, Carolina Power &amp; Light, Duke Power, local corporations that they know about, and it motivates them, and there is some evidence in the record of this motivation... there's an affidavit... to invest in a corporation in which there will be less intangibles taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.689" offset="1835606">There are many decisions of this Court stating that we do not need to know how great the impact on interstate commerce is to strike down discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.860" offset="1868311">A third point, just 2 weeks ago, the supreme court of the State of Kentucky, in a case titled St. Ledger, dealt with a very similar tax upholding it, relying on the Darnell case, which we will come to in a minute, but finding, as a factual matter, the very discrimination that you just described to actually occur and to be a concern to that court, by analogy.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="456.743" offset="1967786">Why do you say that none of the other compensating facts cases involve any discrimination, discriminatory effect on interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="466.783" offset="2008014">I would think even the classic one does.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.318" offset="2014075">I mean, that is the offsetting sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.587" offset="2027136">Every time such a tax is imposed, it becomes much less attractive to buy a car in another State where there's no sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.328" offset="2074156">I mean, you know, if there's a sales tax in Virginia and no sales tax in North Carolina, I will go and buy my car in North Carolina all the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.276" offset="2173944">--Well, up to this point, this Court's opinions in that type of case have... by my reading have looked to two types of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.881" offset="2204350">First, is the imported good taxed by this State?</text>
            <text syncTime="519.734" offset="2219815">Let's talk about the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.602" offset="2227234">Is the imported car taxed by North Carolina at the same rate as the car bought locally?</text>
            <text syncTime="526.757" offset="2247818">If the answer is yes, that's the first cut that there is no discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.776" offset="2267985">Then, as this Court discussed in the decision in Jefferson Lines, there needs to be a credit applied by this State... let's say North Carolina... for any sales tax paid to the other State from which the car was imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.801" offset="2323991">When that credit is applied, that's the second cut to ensure that there is no interstate discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.222" offset="2349696">Well, you can say that there cannot be undue interstate discrimination, perhaps, no more than is necessary to prevent your higher taxes from having what would be the normal economic effect of higher taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.049" offset="2409046">Perhaps the response to your question would be a statement that was made in Armco v. Hardesty, which is a very important case to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.136" offset="2441333">As you may recall, in Armco v. Hardesty, there was concern about the fact that out-of-State manufacturers had to pay the in-State wholesaling tax, but in-State manufacturers only had to pay the in-State manufacturing tax and did not have to pay the wholesaling tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.080" offset="2509147">The decision posited the situation where one State might impose simply a wholesaling tax and one State might impose simply a manufacturing tax, and the decision said that would be okay, that's not a discrimination, and I think that's somewhat analogous to your situation that one State might choose not to tax at all, and another State might tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.122" offset="2785314">It is important to notice that in Darnell there was not the set of facts that we had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.430" offset="2822512">In Darnell, there was not a situation where the tax paid by the corporation to the State of Indiana could remain level, and the tax paid by the shareholder could increase, because the corporation had entered into interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.206" offset="2889699">That was not the way the regime in Indiana worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.824" offset="2900148">The regime in Indiana was a true, either-or situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.045" offset="2916971">It was a true set of mutually exclusive taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.997" offset="2928778">The taxpayers would either pay one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.532" offset="2942989">What the State of Indiana tried to do, I believe, was to tax all stock that it could get its hands on at 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.305" offset="2978097">If the stock were owned by a local resident in an out-of-State corporation, the State of Indiana made that local shareholder pay tax on 100 percent of the value of the stock he owned, a very unremarkable sort of tax, sort of property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.831" offset="3040164">If the corporation was domestic... and this is where the either-or comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.968" offset="3060749">If the corporation was domestic, the shareholder didn't have to pay tax on his stock, but the corporation paid tax, in essence, on all of its stock as if it were paying for the shareholder, and the way that was done was, the corporation paid tax on the greater of the value of the tangible personal property in Indiana that it owned, or the capitalization value of all its market value stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.036" offset="3165030">And therefore, Justice Holmes looked at this situation and said, well, certainly Indiana can tax the stock of residents, and certainly Indiana can make the corporations pay tax on their property, including their capital stock, and we don't see anything wrong with that, and by the way, we're not going to consider the situation where the corporation might own property in Indiana and in other States, because--</text>

I mean, I... just perhaps following up on Justice O'Connor's question, I suppose your reasoning here is going to be equally applicable when we're talking about related taxes on different taxpayers who are themselves related not as shareholder in corporations but as debtor and creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.153" offset="5337477">I mean, I suppose this is going to be applied, your rule would be applied in the area of taxation of savings account interest, and so on, on banks, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.786" offset="5443952">Yes, Your Honor, and that issue has percolated up through the appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.940" offset="5460566">Justice O'Connor, if you are concerned about the repeal, the repeal occurred on April 18 of this year, 3 days after the last due date for the filing of the '95 returns, and therefore the repeal has not even taken effect yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.284" offset="5525977">Last week I called three attorney... three accountants and was told of five cases of assessment of this tax that have occurred since the repeal, and therefore this tax is ongoing in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.794" offset="5576027">The Court has not questioned the compensating tax defense, and I will not dwell on it except to say that it is designed to prevent a preference for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.386" offset="5646349">It is designed to address the situation where the normal taxing regime somehow misses taxation of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.111" offset="5685324">Well, here, the normal taxing regime, the compensated tax, according to the decision of the North Carolina supreme court, is the corporate income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.800" offset="5723985">What does the corporate income tax fall on?</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.185" offset="5733598">It falls on all of the income earned from business in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.637" offset="5751361">This Court has said many times that's all the State of North Carolina is entitled to tax the corporation upon, and therefore, nothing has been missed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.011" offset="5788873">There's nothing left to be compensated for, and yet the North Carolina supreme court decision did indicate that the stock tax was a proxy for tax on corporate income earned out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.819" offset="5836102">No doubt realizing the difficulty of this position, the State has developed a new theory on its appeal brief to this Court that somehow there must be a payment for access to capital markets by foreign corporations, and if the foreign corporation is not paying a corporate income tax to the State, then its shareholders must pay a stock tax, which is a proxy tax on the foreign corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.601" offset="5939234">Getting back to Justice Ginsburg's question, we have no objection to a tax on 100 percent of the value of the foreign corporation's stock, as long as it's also applied to the value of the local corporation's stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.777" offset="5991897">The issue is not really so much the compensating tax defense as the need, as the other shoe that the State has to drop, which is, oh, by the way, we don't just want to tax 100 percent of the value of the stock for access to capital markets, we want to give this deduction so that we don't have double taxation intrastate, and that is, I believe, the real issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.309" offset="6086042">And that brings us, Justice Souter, back to Jefferson Lines, because I believe Jefferson Lines indicated that a State cannot attempt to avoid intrastate double taxation and at the same time create interstate double taxation and ignore taxes paid to other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.854" offset="6156259">And Justice Rehnquist, this also brings us back to... Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, this also brings us back to Darnell, because in Darnell Mr. Justice Holmes said, we need not, or the State of Indiana need not concern itself with the taxes paid by the corporation to other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.601" offset="6239224">That can just simply be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.634" offset="6247374">Well, we know that the more modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence of this Court indicates that a State must concern itself with taxes paid to other States, and that was mentioned in Armco v. Hardesty, where the decision said, this out-of-State manufacturer who is paying the local wholesaling tax undoubtedly is paying an out-of-State manufacturing tax, or may be paying an out-of-State manufacturing tax and therefore it is subject to dual taxation, whereas the manufacturer who sells at home only pays one tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.489" offset="6370777">Now, there might be some question of whether other States have manufacturing taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.358" offset="6386241">Frankly, we don't have one in the State of North Carolina, but there's not much question that almost every State in these 50 States has a corporate income tax, so with respect... so regardless of how many States have stock taxes, every State has a corporate income tax, and therefore to the extent other States are collecting corporate income taxes on multi-State corporations, when their stock is held in North Carolina there will be double taxation, whereas if the stock is owned by the local corporation, and more importantly if the local corporation just keeps its business at home, only one tax is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.531" offset="6526989">If there are no further questions, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.733" offset="6539737">Very well, Mr. Cummings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1629.335" offset="6658124">My understanding, Your Honor, is that there is a list of stocks that's maintained by the State, and he can determine that simply by looking to that list to determine which percentage of the stock is taxable, so I think it's a fairly routine and easy mechanical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.310" offset="6706084">I should say, I think that this case involves two distinct Commerce Clause principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.345" offset="6722176">The first is the principle of nondiscrimination, which we think in this case turns on application of the compensatory tax doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.498" offset="6742865">The second distinct principle is the principle of apportionment, which we think in this case turns on the application of the internal consistency test, and I think it's useful to keep these principles straight, and I'll discuss them separately, starting with the question of discrimination, and on that question, given some of the discussion thus far, I think it's useful to begin with what the State understood the relationship to be between the income tax and the shares tax at the time that it enacted the taxable percentage deduction that's at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.114" offset="6841294">Now, at that time, before it enacted the taxable percentage deduction... and I think I should note, as has been observed, the taxable percentage deduction and, indeed, the entire intangibles tax, have been repealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.289" offset="6889986">We're so excited to get to the meat of the case, Your Honor, that I'm speeding along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.492" offset="6906809">Before the State enacted the taxable percentage deduction it entirely excluded corporate shares from the reach of the intangibles tax, and when the State began to consider an expansion revision of the intangibles tax, it was of the view that intangibles were simply paper representations of other values that might already be subjected to other State taxes, and in particular, that corporate shares were representations of other corporate values that might be subjected to the State property tax or income tax, and when the State determined to expand the intangibles tax to reach corporate shares, it decided to try to avoid duplicative taxation of these related intrastate values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.300" offset="7062081">Now, the State considered but rejected the idea of a discriminatory tax that would exempt the shares of domestic while taxing the shares of foreign corporations, and instead hit upon the idea of the taxable percentage deduction under which the shares of a corporation that pays income tax are exempted from the shares tax, and the shares of a corporation that does not pay income tax are subject to the intangibles tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.447" offset="7142643">The idea was to impose a single, nonduplicative tax on all related intrastate corporate values.</text>

            <text syncTime="1986.699" offset="8087648">What we're suggesting is that under the compensatory tax doctrine, related values that are present in the State and out of State may be subject to tax, and I think it's important, Your Honor, not to confuse the apportionment principle which relates to credits for taxes paid elsewhere and the nondiscrimination principle, which relates to whether or not the taxable percentage deduction here must be struck down as being discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.530" offset="8166956">Now, our understanding of how that deduction should be viewed is that there is one... there are substantially related values, and that is the test the Court has articulated in the compensatory tax doctrine cases, that there are substantially related values between the value of corporate shares and the amount of corporate income as a matter of economic reality, and we think given that substantial relationship, imposing a tax, a tax as a mutually exclusive proxy either on income, if income is taxable, or on the corporate shares which represent those values, that that does not impose a discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.005" offset="8632876">But insofar as the Kentucky court was saying that the kind of system we have here is discriminatory and is not saved by the compensatory tax doctrine, which we disagree with that analysis, as I say, first of all we think that the Court addressed precisely this problem in Darnell, which we don't find cryptic, and I think looking at what Justice Holmes said for a unanimous Court, and looking at the arguments that were made to the Court in Darnell, the argument was precisely the argument that's being made here, that there was a discrimination in the treatment of the corporate shares.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.014" offset="8892847">And the Court, looking at this scheme, said that a tax on the property of a domestic corporation... and this was the Court's language... a tax on the property of a domestic corporation and on the shares of a foreign one is consistent with substantial equality, and that's precisely what we're saying here, that there are related values that are being taxed in precise proportion to one another.</text>

Lott, involved a tax on... one tax on distillers, another tax on distributors and dealers in liquor, so there are different categories who can be subject to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.995" offset="11844788">I think... I mean, the way that the Court has described the compensatory tax doctrine has not required precise equivalents on every aspect of the tax, has not required that the taxes be graphed and all the peaks and valleys match exactly, as long as the ultimate burden on interstate and intrastate commerce match up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.337" offset="11902153">And indeed, the way the Court has described the compensatory tax doctrine in the Oregon Wastes Systems case is that the taxes must be substantially similar, not that they must be identical, which mirrors the language very closely in the Darnell case upon which we rely that their taxes must be consistent with substantial equality, so I don't think that we have to find precision to satisfy the compensatory tax--</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.734" offset="12099743">I think that... as I say, the Court in Hinson v. Lott, the case that this Court cited in Oregon Waste Systems decision as the genesis of the compensatory tax doctrine, long preceded Darnell, and the language the Court used in Darnell is similar, substantially similar to the language that it uses in the Oregon Waste Systems case, so there's no reason to think the Court was applying different standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.029" offset="12172990">In any event, in Oregon Waste Systems, the Court's most recent decision, it referred... has used the language of substantial similarity, and not precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.017" offset="12200889">I think the point of the doctrine is not a formalism that's designed to match up the taxes, as I say, at every point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.103" offset="12221265">The idea of the doctrine is to be sure that interstate commerce is not being disadvantaged, ultimately, in contrast to intrastate commerce, and I think we can demonstrate to you that as a matter of economic reality, that that is not happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.561" offset="12271106">But to return to the question of apportionment, and in terms of consistency, which I think is a crucial question here, and whether or not this should be treated as an intangible property tax and an income tax, the fact is, this is an intangible property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.904" offset="12328471">As in Jefferson Lines, the fact that the tax is put in that form may determine whether or not it's apportionable, and if... look at it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.844" offset="12360236">The taxpayer's complaint here, ultimately, on the apportionment part of the argument, is that its values are being subjected, or could be subjected to duplicative taxation in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.830" offset="12392106">If we're right about the treatment of intangible property, and we think that the Court's holding on that are absolutely clear, then if this precise tax, this precise shares tax on 100 percent of the value, were replicated in some other State, he would have no complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.923" offset="12448530">The taxpayer would have no complaint because of that duplicative taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.709" offset="12459710">So if other States had shares taxes at 100 percent of value, there would be no complaint by the taxpayer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.046" offset="12484997">The fact that the State had income taxes and that is a duplicative taxation because of the substantial similar value shouldn't give him more of a complaint than he has now, and I think Jefferson Lines is very good authority on that point, that one looks to the nature of the taxes being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.538" offset="12542989">Even though the economic effect of the tax, economic reality of the tax may be similar to a tax that has to be apportioned, the fact that the tax is put in forms that does not require apportionment should be dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.013" offset="12584889">So I think ultimately for the Court to rule for the taxpayer in this case, it clearly would have to overrule Darnell v. Indiana, which we think is clearly on point, it would have to set aside the precedents holding that duplicative taxation of intangible property is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.404" offset="12642463">It would also, we think, have to cut back on the principle and say intrastate commerce can be made to pay its own way and need not be placed in a favored position, because if the taxpayer's position here prevails, the State will have to either impose duplicative taxation of intrastate commerce, which is clearly, as an historical matter, what it was trying to avoid, or it will have to abandon any taxation of intangibles altogether, which means it will have to give up the chance to tax values that clearly are present in the State and that it has a right to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.738" offset="12743818">There is no reason for the Court to take such a substantial step in the decision, and the North Carolina supreme court therefore should be affirmed.</text>
