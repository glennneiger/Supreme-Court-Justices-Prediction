            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146485">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-865, The United States v. Winstar Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.217" offset="179295">Mr. Bender.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="9.136" offset="182952">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.309" offset="195700">In 1989, Congress enacted FIRREA, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in an attempt to deal with the calamity... one might more accurately say catastrophe... that had befallen the savings and loan or thrift industry in the United States during the decade of the 1980's largely because of a rise in interest rates at the beginning of the 1980's and then because of the risks that S&amp;L owners took in order to make more money to deal with the losses that were caused by the rise in interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.754" offset="341463">S&amp;L's are invested in... were invested in long term low interest things, mortgages.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.485" offset="360376">Primarily when interest rates go up their profit and loss picture tends to go down if they're stuck with those long-term debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.311" offset="387647">During that decade, about a sixth of all the S&amp;L's in the United States, about 500, had to either be closed or absorbed into other S&amp;L's because they were insolvent, because they failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.200" offset="447207">That accelerated at the end of the eighties.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.332" offset="459745">About half of those failures occurred in 1987 and 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.315" offset="479703">The costs of that failure are enormous.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.018" offset="494541">The cost in money to the insurance fund... which is in turn, was in turn mostly financed by premiums that the banks had to pay, and so when the insurance fund loses the banks have to pay more premiums, and that spirals the losses... the cost to the insurance fund was over $40 billion in those closings.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.758" offset="561414">The cost in public confidence in the industry is probably even greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.913" offset="582103">Still we are familiar with runs on banks and what that can cause, and when large numbers of institutes, one in six, have to start being closed, there is an enormous problem of possibly failing public confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.441" offset="636229">The public at the end of the eighties had $1.3 trillion invested in S&amp;L's, and S&amp;L's in turn are there because Congress put them there in order to help the housing market, and the housing industry, and make housing affordable.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="136.270" offset="691504">And I gather before FIRREA was even passed, the executive branch was concerned about this problem and induced some solvent banks to take on their backs some insolvent banks in order to prevent them from failing.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.719" offset="749287">Isn't that what this is all about?</text>

            <text syncTime="157.103" offset="774887">I thought they did it in order to save the Congress from having to appropriate more money to pay the depositors who would have lost money.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="165.220" offset="807278">They did it for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.680" offset="813130">It was the policy of the Federal bank regulators during the 1980's to close as few banks as possible and to have them absorbed into other banks because the insurance fund had a limited amount of money, and if that money runs out, Congress either has to appropriate money, which it has very rarely done, or the premiums have to be raised on the insurances.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.912" offset="894109">The fund is primarily funded by premiums that the banks pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.384" offset="903932">The banks have to pay more premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.636" offset="908947">The problem that you have of losses becomes even greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.499" offset="924412">The policy, then, was to try to keep the banks alive.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.240" offset="939354">In any case, whoever induced whom by doing what these banks did, the claims on the insurance fund were drastically reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.856" offset="969865">They were eliminated with respect to every one of these failing banks, I take it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="221.445" offset="1032245">Well, the problem reappeared before FIRREA was passed, because if one bank, if one S&amp;L absorbs another, which has happened in one of these three cases, and the other two people came into the industry who hadn't been in it before, and took over a failing thrift, they then often take great risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.186" offset="1095148">Those risks may turn out not to be profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.438" offset="1108209">They then... the larger entity may then fail, and that was what was happening at the end of the eighties.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.971" offset="1174351">I want to talk about the contracts in these three cases, but I think the right context to talk about it in is the context of what Congress did and why they did it in FIRREA and whether that amounted to a breach of any promise that had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.269" offset="1231507">What Congress did in 1989 to deal with... to try to deal with the crisis, they did a number of different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.203" offset="1255226">They, for example, for the first time invested an enormous amount of money in the fund, $100 billion to try to increase public confidence and make the money available.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.748" offset="1289394">The thing they did that's most relevant, or directly relevant to this case, is, the reason banks become insolvent is because they lack capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.122" offset="1318965">I mean, that's almost a truism.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.233" offset="1327324">These banks that... the regulators during the eighties had permitted banks to continue to exist with zero or negative capital by counting things like the goodwill involved in this case as capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.300" offset="1375598">It's not capital, it's a fantasy.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.802" offset="1381659">It's actually a loss that's on the books of the bank you acquire, but they... you're right, that by... the strategy was to not close the banks, and in order to do that they permitted them to count as capital things that were not capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.851" offset="1429829">That is a very risky situation, because... a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.782" offset="1445607">The people who own those banks, if they have no capital in them, having nothing to lose by taking risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.017" offset="1470475">They lost everything they have already because they're at a zero stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.930" offset="1486149">They are encouraged to take more risks to make a profitable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.014" offset="1502449">By taking more risks, there are more failures.</text>
