            <text syncTime="38.097" offset="292184">This holding was not based upon the finding of fact that there was any merger in this instance of the expression in those menus with any idea or process or method.</text>

            <text syncTime="62.464" offset="389673">And clearly there's no finding that any of it was clearly erroneous, so there's no First Circuit--</text>

            <text syncTime="88.054" offset="491969">The judge... the First Circuit did not reject any of that fact finding as clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.698" offset="510568">Rather, the First Circuit reached its conclusion by failing to apply or by applying incorrectly the idea/expression dichotomy.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.549" offset="709934">The error... the error... was that the First Circuit made no effort to determine whether there was expression that could be distinguished or separated from the method of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.298" offset="752984">That's the fundamental error here.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.618" offset="906271">At another extreme, not in this case, would be I suppose the dashboard of the Model T Ford.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.959" offset="1035629">And isn't the problem that the First Circuit had and the problem that we had... have is not an analytical problem, but a problem of saying that something which is kind of in the middle could be classified one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.719" offset="1094666">And Judge Boudin answered that by saying you ought to look to certain, quite practical consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.697" offset="1430600">We have an extensive trial record, and it was the creative choices, unlike Feist where one took a given set of names and simply alphabetized them which did not have that minimum spark of creativity that the Copyright Act requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.737" offset="1490682">In this instance, the creators of Lotus 1-2-3 beyond having made the decisions as to what functions the program should perform, all of which Judge Keeton clearly provided was not protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.305" offset="1533000">The functionality, he said, was part of the unprotected idea, and we did not seek to get him to rule otherwise on that subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.606" offset="1582215">Even taking that as a given, what Judge Keeton found was that the creators of 1-2-3 had a vast array of choices in terms of how they would present that functionality to the user and that's where the expression is.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.193" offset="1636550">The expression is in deciding what words... just deciding whether to have menus or not, deciding what words to use in the menus, deciding what--</text>

            <text syncTime="546.891" offset="2327332">Sure, it's a method of operation but it has expression, and you have to separate the expression out just like you do with an idea, with a procedure, anything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.170" offset="2372471">But Judge Boudin said the user has put in a lot of the user's own sweat or whatever to develop something new, and that something is in the form of all these macros.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.380" offset="2429314">And those macros were not created by Lotus 1-2-3.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.913" offset="2451466">It was the user, working with this machine, to get up... to customize a whole set of things for the user's own operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.798" offset="6674943">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.656" offset="6738369">Pursuant to the patent and the copyright clause of the Constitution, Congress enacted two regimes for the granting of private monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.492" offset="6773791">One regime... under one regime, the grant of private monopoly is done in a wholly indiscriminate, uncritical, unexamined way, and under the other regime, the regime of patents, grants of private monopoly are made following an exacting examination and the satisfaction of very high thresholds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.246" offset="6856756">Now, as Judge Boudin explained below, because of the way Congress set up the first regime, the regime of copyright, it's used for subject matter where the damage to society by a mistake in grant of protection is not all that great, where the problem of overprotection is not something that we should really worry about because even if we mistakenly grant protection, the next author can always make a near substitute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.340" offset="7001160">I think so for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.121" offset="7008266">The first is that 102(a) of the statute... the statute formerly read in 1909, all the writings of an author.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.869" offset="7051211">And that created confusion in the case law, and the language was changed to make it clear that not all writings are copyrightable, but rather that there is a separate ambit for things that we don't worry about overprotection and a regime of patents in which we do worry about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.241" offset="7124772">That's most directly set out in 102(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.222" offset="7140654">That's the language that is expressly intended to keep copyright from undermining the patent system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.175" offset="7216514">Well, Judge Boudin had a variety of things to say in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.697" offset="7234591">But the point that 102(b) is intended to prevent overcompensation to the first author I think comes through from the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.087" offset="7288089">The statute doesn't read the idea of a system is uncopyrightable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.910" offset="7307420">It says a system is uncopyrightable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.542" offset="7317974">It doesn't say the idea of a method of operation is uncopyrightable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.953" offset="7331557">It says a method of operation is uncopyrightable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.577" offset="7342111">If we apply that, 102(b), to the Baker v. Selden situation, Selden may have had a terrific system, but people had no way to use that system, or at least to use it efficiently, until he put some textual labels on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.960" offset="7415671">The same is true of Lotus' system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.083" offset="7424135">The only way people can use systems is through some kind of textual label, and the teaching of Baker v. Selden to us is that the bare set of words, through which people use or manipulate or operate a system, that's on the uncopyrightable side of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.355" offset="7505219">That's what 102(b) does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.308" offset="7513056">It prevents the copyright law from undermining the ambit where we care about overprotection, where a mistake in grant of overprotection would do real damage to society because there's not adequacy of near substitutes.</text>
