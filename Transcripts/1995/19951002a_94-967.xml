            <text syncTime="2971.356" offset="12015371">Next, I would like to address the collateral estoppel issue, which hasn't been spoken about here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.485" offset="12063854">This Court stated in 1991 in the Grogan v. Garner case that collateral estoppel principles are important, particularly in section 523(a)(2)(A) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.512" offset="12111919">In Grogan, of course, you decided that the appropriate standard of proof was preponderance as opposed to clear and convincing, and the reason that the Court gave that... decided that was so that collateral estoppel principles would be furthered between State or Federal court actions and the bankruptcy court actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.404" offset="12191541">Under the same analysis, in order for collateral estoppel to work, there needs to be the same grouping of factors in the two types of cases, and in fact there are situations where a case may go to trial first in the State court, let's say, on a common law fraud action, by which it's determined... by which the debtor prevails, let's say, because there was no reasonable reliance, and then some months later, after there's a filing in bankruptcy, there is an inconsistent ruling in the bankruptcy court, or it could be the other way around, if the bankruptcy ruling under 523(a)(2)(A) could be determined first, and there be an inconsistent result the other direction later in State or Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.259" offset="12394982">Finally, I'd like to address a subject that was mentioned, I believe by Justice Scalia, which is the role that the reliance element really plays, and I think the answer to that question is that it is the principal tool of the factfinder in determining whether there's actual causation, a link between the misrepresentation on the one side and the action taken by the creditor on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.902" offset="12537506">That language is expressly picked up by the Kirsh case, quoting Prosser, and that's the reason that it's important for this Court, in our judgment, to maintain the reliance requirement so that in fact judicial factfinders have this important tool to determine that in fact there is a causal link, which is a real one.</text>
