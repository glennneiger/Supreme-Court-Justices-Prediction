            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="9.994" offset="120464">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.879" offset="140004">The issue before us is the validity of what is called there an intangibles tax which is levied by the State of North Carolina on corporate stock owned by its residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.202" offset="185352">The state taxes are fraction of the value of that stock which is in inversely proportional to the extent of the issuing corporation’s business done within North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.106" offset="232895">Under this regime, therefore shareholder taxes increase to the extent of the corporations in which they invest to do business outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.554" offset="274691">The petitioner, Fulton Corporation, a North Carolina corporation which owns stock in corporations doing business out of state challenged this tax in the State Court System.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.194" offset="321293">Fulton argued that that the tax violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution by discriminating against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.848" offset="351909">The State Supreme Court rejected this argument finding that the intangibles tax was valid compensatory tax which work to equalize the burdens on inter and intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.724" offset="403422">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we reverse the judgment of the North Carolina Supreme Court and hold that the State’s intangibles tax discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.785" offset="459638">Although we acknowledge that certain taxes that facially discriminate against interstate commerce, as this one does, may nonetheless be part of a valid compensating tax regime, we have solely replied this exception in practice outside the limited field of sales and used taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.865" offset="527974">North Carolina’s tax meets none of the criteria established in our cases for a valid compensatory tax and accordingly it cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.265" offset="561516">We therefore remand the case to the Supreme Court of North Carolina to determine the appropriate remedy for this constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.498" offset="594534">Although the Chief Justice has filed a concurring statement, the opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
