            <text syncTime="169.293" offset="806529">It is our position that that motion permitted Judge Sarokin in the District Court of New Jersey to depart not only from the applicable guideline range, which in that case was 135 to 168 months, but also below the 10-year statutory minimum that was in place in that case, or in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.988" offset="10977357">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I know I have a couple of minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.308" offset="10986656">I just want to address a point raised by Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.362" offset="11002852">I believe that Your Honor was questioning the Solicitor General about statistical evidence showing the effect of the departures under section 5K1.1 not only below the guidelines but also below mandatory minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.725" offset="11076308">I believe the annual report of the Commission, the Sentencing Commission, reflects those statistics, and if this Court wishes I can certainly produce an additional submission to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.670" offset="11120090">I would note, and again it's not in my papers, but of the research that I've done in a couple of the circuits, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit that have ruled in favor of petitioner, the number of departure... number of departure applications by the Government has gone up, and has gone up significantly since those decisions were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.945" offset="11197203">But again, if the Court wishes for me to provide that information, I'd be delighted to do it in each one of the circuits where this decision was made in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.679" offset="11236073">Otherwise, I'll simply rely upon my briefs and on the arguments that I submitted before this Court today, and ask that you rule in favor of Mr. Melendez.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.184" offset="11262091">Thank you.</text>
