            <text syncTime="8.128" offset="175479">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.749" offset="193974">One hundred and twenty one Indian tribes in 23 States have entered into 137 compacts pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.475" offset="232844">The act carefully balances the interests of three sovereigns, the States, the United States, and the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.090" offset="263251">The act provides the States with an opportunity to play a significant role in the scope of Indian gaming within those States.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.625" offset="297419">Central to the act is the duty of State officials to negotiate in good faith with the Indian tribes regarding gaming, and central to the act is the ability of the tribes to sue the States in Federal court if the States have not negotiated in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.378" offset="372443">The decision below held that the Seminole Tribe did not have the right to sue the State of Florida and its Governor in Federal court despite Congress' clear promise that that right existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.957" offset="430748">The court below found that there was no consent by Florida to this lawsuit, and that under Article I, the Foreign... I'm sorry, the Indian Commerce Clause, there was no power in Congress to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity, and finally, the court found that Ex Parte Young did not work in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.613" offset="517370">Our position is, is that there is the power to abrogate under the Indian Commerce Clause, and that if there is not, Ex Parte Young permits Federal rights to be vindicated and the interests of the Supremacy Clause to be protected by the suit against the Governor.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.742" offset="581945">Mr. Rogow, as a practical matter, what would the Indian tribes lose by the affirmance of the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit here?</text>
            <text syncTime="117.739" offset="613919">They would still... they'd get regulations coming from the Secretary, which is what Congress could have given them in the first place.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce S. Rogow</label>
            <text syncTime="125.804" offset="646101">Under the decision of the Eleventh Circuit, they can go directly to the Secretary if they cannot sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.587" offset="669298">If a State raises Eleventh Amendment immunity, and if a State will not negotiate in good faith, the court of appeals said they could go directly to the Secretary, and that is true that the Congress could have kept the States out of Indian gaming altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.797" offset="730111">If that decision of the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed, including the remedy the Eleventh Circuit left, then the tribes could go directly to the Secretary of the Interior.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.255" offset="775982">As I recall the Secretary is supposed to make his decision based on the negotiating positions of the parties, which precede that step in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.260" offset="816002">So there being no negotiating position, what makes you think that that section of the act subsists when the portion providing for suit against the States falls?</text>

            <text syncTime="248.084" offset="1135218">If the State has failed to negotiate at all, then the court would say to the State, you have an opportunity now to conclude a compact within 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.089" offset="1167296">If the State still refuses to do that, then a mediator would be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.603" offset="1185373">The only compact submitted would be the tribe's compact, and then that would go to the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.468" offset="1224766">The case or controversy is whether or not the State has acted in good faith, has negotiated in good faith, and that discrete fact is one that needs to be resolved for the rest of the process to work.</text>
