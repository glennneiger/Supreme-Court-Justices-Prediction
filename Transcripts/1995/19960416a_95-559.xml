            <label>Mr. Mark R. Kravitz</label>
            <text syncTime="10.779" offset="183367">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.393" offset="201861">Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act makes written provisions valid, irrevocable, and enforceable except for grounds that apply for the revocation of any contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.510" offset="238328">In this case, however, the Montana supreme court refused to enforce the parties' agreement to arbitrate because it failed to comply with the heightened notice statute that, by its plain language, applies only to arbitration agreements and not to other contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.667" offset="290887">Respondents thus have tried to recast Montana's notice statute as codifying some general principle of unexpectedness, but that effort fails for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.454" offset="330070">First, Montana's law does no such thing, since it applies to only one type of provision, arbitration agreements, and it applies to them whether they're unexpected or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.202" offset="369045">Second, the FAA prevents a court from refusing to enforce the parties' agreement to arbitrate on the basis of a State law principle that turns on the fact that the subject matter involved is arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.119" offset="416693">Thus, under the FAA, a State may not decide, as Montana has decided here, that a contract is fair enough to enforce its basic terms but not fair enough to enforce its arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.917" offset="459951">Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act to clear away judicial and legislative suspicion of arbitration, in and so doing, Congress decided for itself to determine the circumstances under which arbitration clauses would be enforceable, unencumbered by State law constraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.839" offset="531631">To that end, the text of section 2 alone determines the enforceability of an arbitration agreement, and that text provides that arbitration provisions are enforceable and valid and irrevocable, save for one explicit, and explicitly limited, exception: upon grounds that exist for the revocation of any contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.864" offset="615746">We believe that in determining whether or not a State law or principle fits within that savings clause, two considerations are paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.351" offset="653675">First, the savings clause is an exception to a sweeping general rule of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.692" offset="679066">Therefore, the Court must be on its guard not to allow the exceptions to swallow or undercut the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.548" offset="706443">Second, section 2 establishes a principle of what I'll call rigorous equality for arbitration clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.133" offset="732774">They may be no less valid, no less enforceable, and no less irrevocable than other contract terms under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.507" offset="766315">As a result, this Court has identified two tests that State laws or principles must pass before a law fits within the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.253" offset="801319">First, the law must be one of general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.786" offset="815426">That is to say, it must apply to contracts generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.978" offset="828173">Secondly, even if it is in theory a general principle of law, the particularized application of that general principle cannot turn on the fact that the subject matter involved is arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.454" offset="6186097">The issue presented in this case is whether a Montana notice statute, a statute which is aimed at ensuring that parties know that they're signing a contract that includes an arbitration provision, is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.792" offset="6239386">The Montana notice requirement is different from all the State requirements that this Court has preempted in the past because its function is not to prevent arbitration but to help ensure that arbitration is consensual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.130" offset="6288810">The statutes preempted in Southland, in Perry, and in Terminex prevented the enforcement of arbitration agreements so that there was nothing a person who wanted to enforce arbitration could do to make sure that it would be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.760" offset="6343354">Here, on the other hand, it's in the total control of the person drafting the agreement to make sure that the arbitration provision will be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.590" offset="6594652">And in that case, I don't think that would have been prevented by the Federal Arbitration Act, because what the Court would be doing in that case is applying a general contract principle of unexpected... of reasonable expectations doctrine to the arbitration provision and invalidating it, and that that's simply what the Montana court is doing--</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.640" offset="12990786">I want to make two points in my rebuttal, if I may, just so that I'm clear about what our position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.825" offset="13015550">The first is this, and it was the second point that I made in my opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.878" offset="13035821">Regardless of whether or not this statute merely codifies some general principle of expectedness, which I don't think it does, but assuming for a moment that it does, as Ms. Sikes has said, it still falls under the FAA, so it would not be possible on remand for the Montana supreme court to decide we're now going to apply a general principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.003" offset="13132265">The general principle is adhesion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.515" offset="13138325">We're not going to call it a statute, we're going to call it a general principle, and we're going to find that this is unexpected because Montana has outlawed arbitration for 100 years, and therefore no one in Montana would expect such a clause, and this Court dealt with precisely that issue in Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.355" offset="13197675">In footnote 9 in Perry the Court said, you cannot have a statute that singles out arbitration, but it didn't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.339" offset="13229649">It went on and said, but there's one thing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.800" offset="13239471">If you're applying a State law principle of general applicability, and in that case it was the law of unconscionability, one can... a State cannot decide that a principle is violated on the basis of the fact that arbitration is involved because after all, if that's what could be done, then the courts could do that which this Court has said the legislatures may not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.129" offset="13408745">The second point I wanted to make was that this statute, Ms. Sikes says it's easy to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.535" offset="13430374">I suggest to the court that the test that this Court has announced is not whether it's easy to comply with, but you have looked at what is required of other terms in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.762" offset="13475305">And looked at from that point of view, which is the point of view that the FAA requires, other terms in this particular contract don't have to be in underlined capital letters, it's only the arbitration clause that must be, and so the fact that we might be able to comply for this one clause doesn't satisfy the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.812" offset="13551478">The lens that this Court has to look through is the lens as to how other clauses are treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.508" offset="13574257">I would also say, incidentally, that the obstacles to complying with these State laws are great, and to follow up on Justice Ginsburg supposition, it's not a supposition.</text>
