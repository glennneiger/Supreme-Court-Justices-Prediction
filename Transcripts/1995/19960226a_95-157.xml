            <text syncTime="28.322" offset="252242">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.482" offset="268856">Selective prosecution claims are among the most difficult our courts have to face, for they require striking an especially delicate balance between protecting prosecutorial discretion and decisionmaking from improper, outside interferences and scrutiny while ensuring that the law is in force in conformity with the Constitution and the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.391" offset="360493">This Court has noted that judicial scrutiny of a prosecutor's charging decision imposes high costs on the criminal justice system, and that since tradition and experience have taught that most prosecutors will faithfully obey their duty, courts should properly be hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.204" offset="443772">But courts must also discharge their responsibility to ensure that the Government enforces the laws evenhandedly, rather than based upon invidious discrimination, but when the Government acts with an evil eye and an unequal hand, rather than in a manner faithful to equal protection and due process, both those directly affected by that conduct in the rule of law are its victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.403" offset="544500">This Court's decisions, especially in Yick Wo and Wayte, have struck this balance on the merits by requiring that, absent proof of an explicitly discriminatory classification, a criminal defendant alleging selective prosecution must make two showings in order to prevail, first, that persons in similar circumstances have not been prosecuted and, second, that the difference in treatment is motivated by an intent to discriminate against the group to which the defendant belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.352" offset="664350">In other words, there has to be a showing of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory purport.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.088" offset="687233">This case, however, presents for decision a question that this Court has yet to resolve, namely, what standards should Federal courts utilize in determining whether a criminal defendant alleging selective prosecution is entitled to discovery.</text>
