            <text syncTime="11.710" offset="174850">Exxon's tanker would never have stranded but for respondent's torts and breaches of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.167" offset="204630">The question presented is whether these respondents should be totally absolved of all liability because the district court found that the tanker captain's navigation of the stricken vessel was grossly negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.496" offset="265966">The answer to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.419" offset="277668">The lower courts reached the opposite conclusion by failing to apply the comparative fault principles established by this Court in Reliable Transfer and its progeny by misconceiving and misapplying the common-law doctrine of superseding cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.158" offset="404623">You must have causation, mustn't you, before you inquire about damages and, of course, that leads to the next question, do you... you're not telling us, I take it, that but-for causation suffices?</text>

            <text syncTime="86.461" offset="473796">Not suffices but, but for that issue, you'd never reach the question whether there's any superseding cause, because superseding cause, if it applies at all in admiralty since Reliable Transfer, necessarily assumes, as the district court concluded, that there had been actual cause, or you'd never reach superseding cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.367" offset="577450">You don't reach superseding cause, which is a limitation of liability, and it's not causation at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.204" offset="736797">I do not suggest for a moment that an admiralty claimant need not prove both.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.920" offset="771696">The difficulty here is that the foreclosure orders of the district court prevented Exxon from ever proving its liability case-in-chief to prove that there was legal cause as well as but-for cause, and you never got to the issue of damages because you never finished proving liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.525" offset="858109">All of Exxon's evidence with respect to everything that happened before the equipment failed was foreclosed by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.801" offset="895203">It wasn't a question of order of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.312" offset="905234">It was the question of entering judgment before the liability case-in-chief was proved.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.564" offset="970227">And he was saying, rightly or wrongly as a matter of fact, but I think correctly as a matter of law, that he was going to first inquire whether or not the negligence of the Captain's tanker was a supervening cause of this extraordinary proportion, and you weren't foreclosed in producing any evidence on that issue, were you?</text>

            <text syncTime="232.068" offset="1056222">Yes, because the Captain was reacting to a series of hazards that were created prior to the time the equipment failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.107" offset="1100421">Exxon was foreclosed from proving anything that happened before that, and even under common-law doctrine, no one can prove there is a superseding cause or that there is not unless there is first proved what the duties are with respect to each of the defendant's acts on the basis of their relationship with each other, and how those breaches of duties created the risks of harm, and until those facts are proved, there is no way in which a court can decide whether there has been superseding cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.136" offset="7060519">At that time, at 1830, about 1 hour and 2 minutes after the breakaway, that vessel had traversed the leeward coast, it had gotten itself into fair water, and only at that point of time, when the Captain made an unforced decision to linger and remain, did that hose become a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.350" offset="7137423">And the hose, Justice Scalia, was under the control of the assist vessel NENE, and if it presented a problem, it was a problem to the maneuverability of the vessel, not to the navigation of the vessel, and it was the navigation of the vessel subsequent to this time, the navigation subsequent to this 1830, that resulted in the stranding of the vessel an hour and 39 minutes later.</text>
