            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="81150">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 94-1614, Wisconsin versus the City of New York and companion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.239" offset="118035">In preparing to conduct the 1990 Census, the Secretary of Commerce determined that past censuses which were essentially headcount consistently had undercounted the actual population and that some minorities had been undercounted at a greater rate than the rest of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.711" offset="191909">As part of an effort to improve the quality of the 1990 Census, the Secretary considered the possibility of using a statistical adjustment of the actual count in order to correct for the undercount.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.297" offset="242273">But he decided against that possibility after deciding that he could not be certain but the statistical adjustment would improve the quality of the Census.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.886" offset="280621">Several cities and individuals sued arguing that Secretary’s decision not to use the statistical adjustment was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.772" offset="316148">The District Court rejected their argument but a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.952" offset="348957">It noted that the Constitution requires Census data to be used to apportion members of the house of representative and then looking at this Court’s decisions requiring States to adhere that the principle of one person one vote decided that the Secretary’s decision not to use the adjustment infringe on the rights of individuals to have their votes counted equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.687" offset="443834">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.173" offset="457836">We hold that the reasoning underlying our one person one vote cases does not apply to the Federal Government’s decisions regarding the conduct of the Census.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.124" offset="497646">The Constitution vests Congress with virtually unlimited discretion over the conduct of the Census and through the Census Act, Congress has delegated its broad authority over the Census to the Secretary of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.030" offset="553235">The Secretary’s conduct of the census is constitutional so long as there is a reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of an actual count of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.727" offset="595971">Here the Secretary based his decision against statistical adjustment on three conclusions: First, he decided it was more important for the Census to accurately measure the proportion of people in different areas than it was for the Census to accurately measure the total number or people in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.006" offset="677160">Second, he found that statistical adjustment of the preliminary Census data was something that had never been tried before, and finally he determined that statistical adjustment would not improve the distributive accuracy of the Census.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.825" offset="736406">We found the first state conclusion consistent with the constitutional purpose of the Census, and we find the second and third conclusions to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.475" offset="770992">Therefore we hold the Secretary’s decision not statistically adjust the 1990 Census is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.508" offset="799099">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
