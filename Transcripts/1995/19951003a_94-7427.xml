            <text syncTime="12.060" offset="193646">This case raises two important questions about the procedural rights afforded to defendants who tender guilty pleas, including criminal forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.016" offset="229486">The two questions are: first, whether Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the district court to find a factual basis for the defendant's guilty plea to the criminal forfeiture, and second, whether a defendant who waives... excuse me, a defendant who pleads guilty waives his right to a jury verdict on forfeiture if he was not advised of that right and never expressly waived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.944" offset="337215">Briefly, the facts are as follows: in exchange for the prosecutor's agreement to recommend a 20-year sentence on one count, and to drop the remaining counts, petitioner pled guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. section 848, and he signed an agreement containing three paragraphs regarding criminal forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.989" offset="425404">As construed by the court of appeals, paragraph 10 of that agreement forfeited all of petitioner's property, including legitimately acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.803" offset="464588">The district court accepted petitioner's plea without making a finding that there was a factual basis for this forfeiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.838" offset="1416803">It could become subject to forfeiture, depending upon the facts that were shown, and the district court never made those factual findings in the first instance, so if I can clarify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.257" offset="1462465">The district court also accepted petitioner's plea without advising him that he had a right to a special jury verdict on the question of what property, if any, was subject to forfeiture, although he had a right, and it would have been possible for him to plead guilty, and nonetheless contest on the section 848 charge, and nonetheless contest forfeiture before the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.269" offset="1842495">One of the issues before the Court is the question of the waiver standard that's applicable to the jury trial right, and on that point, for example, if the judge had clearly indicated to Mr. Libretti not simply that the jury won't find you guilty or innocent, which is what he told Mr. Libretti, but had said, the jury won't find you guilty or innocent, and you have a right to have that determination, and the jury won't make any determination of what assets are forfeitable, and you have a right to that determination as well, now, do you want to plead guilty, that would have taken care of the waiver of the jury trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.924" offset="1993169">There's an independent requirement, however, under Rule 11(f) for a factual basis, and I think that's clear if you imagine a case... laying forfeiture to one side, if you imagine a case as a bank robbery case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.144" offset="14038021">--I mean, in... the Rule 11 really encompasses two categories of information that have to be conveyed to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.880" offset="14068950">One is information about what will happen to you if you plead guilty, what's the minimum and maximum sentence, and so forth, and the other category of information is, what rights would you be able to insist on if you didn't plead guilty and insisted upon a trial, and the idea is to allow the defendant in some rough sense to compare the options available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.314" offset="14154632">I think one thing that's noteworthy about the second category of information... what would happen to you if you insisted upon a right to trial... is that it doesn't include any information about sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.933" offset="14197159">That is, the defendant is not required to be told, this would be your minimum and maximum sentence if you insisted upon a right to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.167" offset="14226103">Indeed, in Brady v. United States, the Court held that a defendant's guilty plea was voluntary even though he reasonably believed that he would be subject to a sentence of death if he insisted upon trial and was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.207" offset="14286289">It turned out that that was not the case, that that statutory capital provision was invalid, and therefore the defendant pleaded guilty under the misapprehension that he would be subject to a capital sentence if he contested the charges, so the rule simply doesn't require the same quantum of information as to what would happen if you contested the charges as it would--</text>
