            <text syncTime="20.506" offset="214576">This case presents a single issue involving the interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code, and that issue is whether a bank creditor may refuse a debtor depositor's request to withdraw funds pending a Bankruptcy Court's determination of the bank's right of setoff without violating the automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.157" offset="293153">The Court's answer to this question should govern the conduct of nonbank and bank creditors alike, including the United States Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.350" offset="1341917">It's an act which on a literal reading offends some of these statues.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.745" offset="1367517">And it seems to me that your best argument is to say, well, it just offends them a little bit, and it offends them only to the extent necessary to make sense of this equally valid statutory recognition of the right to set off, that if you don't allow this, the right to set off recognized in the code is nonsense, and try to reconcile, rather than to say, well, the bank is absolutely Simon-pure at all times, and it never literally violates a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.526" offset="1490606">It seems to me that that is a more plausible position than to say that, here, for example, the freeze does not affect the status quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.078" offset="4400856">The Bankruptcy Code expressly preserves a creditor's right of setoff, but section 362 of the code stays its exercise pending an orderly determination of the debtor's and creditor's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.698" offset="4463341">In our view, the court of appeals was wrong in this case to conclude that the bank exercised its right of setoff and thereby violated section 362 when it froze respondent's bank account pending a judicial determination of its rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.691" offset="4531259">That freeze was simply a refusal to pay a contract debt that was consistent with the language and the purpose of the automatic stay, and in our view, any other conclusion in this case would render the right of a setoff meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.011" offset="4596565">Let me start with the language of 362(a)(7) on which the court of appeals relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.946" offset="4620284">A freeze is not a setoff under that provision, because subsection (a)(7) stays the setoff of a prepetition debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.212" offset="4669394">By using the word setoff without further definition, Congress must have intended to use the word in its ordinary common law meaning, which is... which is one that requires an overt act in order to cancel the competing balances, and that results in the record of that event.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.891" offset="4840026">For purposes of section 362 at least, we think it should and is a matter of Federal law, and let me sort of get into that a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.401" offset="4886106">There is no question that the right that is reserved by the code as a substantive matter under section 553 is one that is not conferred by bankruptcy law but it is dependent in some underlying sorts of law that may be Federal or State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.123" offset="4945039">In the cases in which we deal, it will usually be a Federal right, either because of a statute or because of Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.490" offset="4978475">But for purposes of the stay, the language that Congress chose indicates that Congress was intending to cover certain classes of conduct that were pretty much to be covered uniformly, and it cannot be, for example, that a State that has a quirky law like the... like Pennsylvania had in one of the reported cases, for example, saying that there was an automatic setoff, that that would result in the violation of a stay without any action on the part of the creditor as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.538" offset="5146704">As used in section 362, it seems to me more sensible to read the language in its ordinary legal sense, and therefore, until and unless a creditor takes some affirmative act to credit and debit the offsetting balances and to make a record of that event, a setoff has not occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.052" offset="5224758">By contrast, a freeze, like the stay itself, merely maintains the status quo by conserving the offsetting balances in the same State until there is a judicial determination of the party's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.153" offset="5293094">So it may well be that in some sense the freeze itself is an affirmative act, but it's not one that is an affirmative act in the sense that is relevant here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.740" offset="10379448">The difference is, again, that security deposit put up to the landlord, put up to the bank for the secured credit card, does not have in it any right of the debtor to take the money out at any time to draw on it by a check.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.596" offset="12126936">This Court recognized in Bank of Marin v. England that the funds in the bank account belong to the bank, not the depositor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.503" offset="12158492">When the bank places an administrative hold on the account, all it is doing is simply refusing to pay its debt to the depositor to the extent of the right of setoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.598" offset="12198929">There is no basis in the code, contrary to respondent's position, to treat financial institutions worse than every other class of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.234" offset="12237486">Maryland law certainly doesn't, and the respondent's answers to this Court's questions today have been inconsistent, depending on the question, and the only reconciliation of those positions is that financial institutions are not entitled to be treated, under the code, like other creditors, but that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.257" offset="12313554">The legislative history indicates that the Congress thought about financial institutions and the right of setoff, and they wanted to preserve it for a policy reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.584" offset="12350857">They didn't want banks to act precipitously in anticipation of a possible bankruptcy and by a setoff actually cause more bankruptcies to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.840" offset="12391817">If the lower court's decision is upheld, it would have that effect of encouraging precipitous action by banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.763" offset="12415536">This Court recognized in Studley v. Boylston National Bank, that the doctrine of setoff is based on the absurdity of making A pay B when B owes A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.463" offset="12462348">The Bankruptcy Code does not require this Court to make that absurdity the law of this land.</text>
