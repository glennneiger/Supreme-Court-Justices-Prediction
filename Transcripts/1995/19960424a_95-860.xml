            <label>Mr. Michael D. Donovan</label>
            <text syncTime="20.295" offset="216817">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="30.931" offset="259449">This case concerns the meaning of the phrase 85 of the National Bank Act, which was passed by Congress originally in 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.978" offset="295602">In particular, this case brings before the Court the question of whether Congress intended "interest" and "rate" in that section... in that phrase to include some certain late fees that are not measured by time or based upon an unpaid balance or unpaid late payment, so as to preempt State contract laws, State laws governing liquidated damages that regulate such late fees in a borrower's home State.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.724" offset="394554">The briefs of the parties here, Your Honors, have presented three contrasting views as to what Congress meant when it used the phrase 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.339" offset="433006">In Petitioner's view, Congress meant a charge measured by time, based upon an unpaid balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.234" offset="460592">In Respondent's view, Congress meant all lending charges; that is, all charges that have an impact upon the borrower/lender relationship so as to affect the yield that the lender receives from a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.323" offset="517016">There's a third contrasting view here, and that's presented by the Government that has filed an amicus brief in support of the bank in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.231" offset="548572">That view, espoused by the OCC recently, is that "interest at the rate" does not mean all lending charges, even though it might have meant that at one point, but it means something now or something less than all lending charges, but the agency will tell us precisely what interest charges are interest at the rate and what interest charges are not interest at--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="124.252" offset="632686">Well, Mr. Donovan, if... if the term "interest" is open to some interpretation, there either is or is going to be, I gather, a comptroller's interpretation of the term.</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_d_donovan" startTime="138.253" stopTime="141.605">

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="141.605" offset="702068">Do we owe any deference to that, where it will expressly include late fees?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_d_donovan" startTime="147.548" stopTime="230.430">
            <label>Mr. Michael D. Donovan</label>
            <text syncTime="147.548" offset="725891">The question of deference to the comptroller ought to be looked at initially by looking at the Statute itself, to determine whether the Statute itself addresses that, so as to whether there should be any need to turn to the comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.137" offset="780226">And here, we believe that there are at least four phrases in the Statute or in the National Bank Act itself which give guidance to this Court as to why neither deference is appropriate and why "interest at the rate" mean... means what Petitioner says it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.426" offset="845428">First, Your Honors, is the phrase "interest at the rate" itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.959" offset="859534">Interest, both in 1864 and commonly today, was conceived of a charge that was somehow connected to the time during which money is received by a borrower and the time in which it's paid back.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.487" offset="909584">It is also a charge that has some relationship to the amount of money received by the borrower and... and the time in which the borrower would then have to return that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.253" offset="944693">Another phrase that is in the Statute itself, Section 85 of the National Bank Act, is found further down in the Section, and it refers to a common type of lending practice that was prevalent in the mid-1800's, and that was the advance collection of interest on discounted notes, where a borrower would tend... tender his notes in exchange for a currency, and the bank would discount that note at the outset to collect interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.211" offset="1052526">Upon that--</text>

            <text syncTime="231.292" offset="1060886">That... that's not disappeared?</text>

            <text syncTime="233.114" offset="1068095">In fact, it still happens today, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.386" offset="1077186">But what Congress allowed in Section 85 was that you may collect interest in advance... and I'll... and using the words of this Statute,</text>
            <text syncTime="243.981" offset="1111563">"reckoning the days for which the note, bill or other evidence of debt has to run. "</text>
            <text syncTime="249.954" offset="1135491">Now, reckoning isn't a common word today, but it was referring to some xx of calculation of time and amount, reckoning the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.302" offset="1172899">Well, that... that shows that it does include that kind of interest, the... the normal kind, but it doesn't show that it excludes the other kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.454" offset="1201529">The trouble I have with your position, Mr. Donovan, is I don't see how effective this provision in the Bank Act would be, which was intended to be a usury provision, if it said it's perfectly okay so long as you put in the loan agreement</text>
            <text syncTime="280.185" offset="1256386">"interest shall be 6 percent per year, plus $10 a week no matter what the outstanding balance is. "</text>
            <text syncTime="287.368" offset="1285121">I mean that would be wonderful usury, and it... and it would not at all be protected by... protected against by Section 85.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.691" offset="1350427">The... the simple answer to that is that Congress... that's all they were asked to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.534" offset="1373833">That's all they were focusing on doing in... in terms of allowing banks to charge a rate of interest that was tied to the bank's home State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.995" offset="6331664">For example, when this Court examined whether... whether deposits and commercial loans were similar, or annuities even, it has focused on the fact that the OCC has determined or the regulator has determined that these are functionally similar to different types of financial products.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.937" offset="6467397">Well, what the OCC is asking for, then, is deference not to an expert view, but to lower court opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.532" offset="6493833">And this Court doesn't need an agency to tell it whether to defer to lower court decisions or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.397" offset="7285238">Many of the State statutes... in fact, by my count, all of the State statutes use a phrase to set the ceiling of... of interest, whether it's prematurity interest or postmaturity interest, they use a phrase "the rate of interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.977" offset="7347619">And the statutes say a lender can charge interest up the rate of X. And generally that rate is stated as a percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.694" offset="7386489">And it has always been the case that that phrase "rate of interest", in a statute regulating the amount of interest that could be charged, captured all forms of charges, and it has to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.643" offset="7434241">Because if it didn't, a lender... let's say that the rate is 15 percent, a lender could say, Well, I'm going to charge you 14-and-a-half percent, plus a $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.908" offset="7467364">And the $1,000 isn't interest, so I don't have to worry about the rate ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.693" offset="7486486">The phrase "rate of interest" not only has a dictionary definition that includes all forms of charges, but it was always used by statutes and by courts interpreting those statutes to capture all forms of lending charges that had to do with the use or detention of money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.989" offset="7723677">In other words, did the... did the language allowed by the laws of the State in Section 85 adopt the manner in which the rate of interest was to be calculated?</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.647" offset="7770280">Because in that particular case, there was a dispute about how many times per year it was compounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.461" offset="7789506">And, Justice Stevens, I believe that the opinion by Justice Holmes is very clear on this point, that the question of the unit of time is up to the law of the State where the bank is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.551" offset="7849901">Like the amount of the charge, like the ceiling rate, if you will, the manner of computation... the unit of time... is committed to the legislature of the State where the bank is located.</text>

            <text syncTime="1960.461" offset="7977483">That is to say, Section 85 reads that any national bank may... may charge interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State where the bank is located or... here's the alternative... or at a rate of 1 percent in excess of the discount rate on 90-day commercial paper, whichever may be greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.564" offset="8057940">That alternative doesn't make any sense when it's applied to a flat $1,000 charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.278" offset="8080824">And... and that suggests that... that what goes before the alternative only describes nonflat charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.912" offset="8171312">And lenders have always had to determine (A) how much interest have we charged this particular borrower?</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.395" offset="10333310">The opinion, first, addresses whether the method of compounding that was used by the bank violated the... violated Section 85 because it exceeded the method of compounding permitted by the home State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.049" offset="10411886">And the answer was, by Justice Holmes, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.250" offset="10420664">Because instead of compounding only once per year, which was his analysis of what the State required as to the unit of time, the bank had compounded oftener than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.417" offset="10465385">And so I offer that... that part of Donnell for the proposition that the law of the State as to the method of computation is adopted by Section 85.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.514" offset="10557754">Which is that a charge, even if it could be labelled a penalty, because it's too high in someone's estimation, is still interest and thus that... what the parties contended... what the borrower was contending was... what the bank, excuse me, was contending was penal interest and therefore not usurious, not covered by Section 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.490" offset="10665692">They lost that argument, Justice Holmes saying you have to forfeit all of that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.293" offset="10680843">It is interest even though it was penal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.935" offset="10691397">And of course, this Court, in Library of Congress against Shaw, has said the same; that the character of interest does not change even if a charge could aptly be called a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.391" offset="10737268">The purpose of this Statute requires a meaning of interest that would, for example, prevent a State where a bank is located from saying to a credit union, You can charge late fees, but not giving that privilege to other lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.303" offset="10808843">Because then we could become the least-favored lender in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.156" offset="10824308">Interest has to have a capacious definition for the purpose of capturing those lending charges that could be the basis for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.103" offset="10860043">This Court has... in... in the Tiffany case, in the Marquette case, shown that the congressional purpose to favor national banks has to be respected in understanding the meaning of the... of the statutory terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.932" offset="10927439">The case comes to the Court on this issue of the meaning of the term "rate of interest", with not only the history of the word "interest", the... the word "rate", which Black's Law Dictionary defines, without any reference to the form of a charge, as simply the amount of a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.730" offset="11026600">Noah Webster, in 1828, a similar definition: Price or amount stated or fixed on anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.425" offset="11053349">What I would want to emphasize is that the term "rate of interest", that was simply the cap... that... that is the way that States, and then the Federal Government, went about regulating the amount that could be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.881" offset="11103191">The term "rate" and "amount" is used interchangeably in the Statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3100.096" offset="12536060">The... the second point I wanted to make here is that the Comptroller reasonably started with the premise that a... interest in the lending context could potentially include any charge for the use or the detention of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.606" offset="12598126">That is the formulation that this Court adopted in Brown against Hiatt at around the time that the Statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.851" offset="12631041">And it was clearly not unreasonable for the Comptroller to adopt that same basic approach to the meaning of "interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.148" offset="12668239">The third point I want to make is that the Comptroller here did reasonably conclude that late fees are interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.511" offset="12697705">A late fee is a charge that a borrower pays as a condition of receiving an extension of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.747" offset="12726649">It is imposed when the borrower fails to pay on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.730" offset="12742636">It is part of the price for using the credit card, and therefore reasonably viewed as a charge for the use of detention of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.255" offset="12780670">And the final point I want to make is that the Comptroller reasonably determined that it should not make any difference, for purposes of Section 85, whether the late fee is charged as a percentage of the outstanding balance or whether it is charged at a flat rate, such as $15 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.921" offset="12871367">That is a matter of form rather than substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.162" offset="12888295">If you have a State which has, for example, a 10 percent limit on late fees and you have a borrower with a balance of $100, it should not make any difference whether a national bank charges 15 percent late fees or a $15 flat late fee.</text>

Hiatt as the basic concept of interest, but to still leave the material to the determination of interest, but not have it play so big a role in determining what the meaning of interest was under Section 85.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.846" offset="13455047">Three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.667" offset="13458391">One, the definition adopted and proposed by the OCC here has no real logical stopping point, which is the primary problem with the definition of use, forbearance or detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.883" offset="13503217">Virtually any charge can be characterized as a charge for a detention of money: an attorney's fee, a court cost, any collection fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.840" offset="13535086">However, Congress did not intend to embrace all of those charges into 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.162" offset="13560373">In fact, Congress had another provision, Section 24, which authorized banks to make contracts and to... subjected those banks to State contract laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.271" offset="13604781">The Comptroller admits that that section prevents discrimination by home States against banks with regard to contract charges such as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.858" offset="13643129">That section takes care of Respondent's credit union hypothesis, that there could be discrimination unless Section 85 means everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.062" offset="13679909">That can't happen, and it's not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.615" offset="13690149">They haven't challenged the credit union measure.</text>
