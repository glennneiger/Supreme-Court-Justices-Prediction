            <text syncTime="120.944" offset="625994">However, it should not matter as a matter of law, even if the Court does take the case with that finding unchanged, because our position is that Lonchar's motivation, subjective motivation for filing a first Federal habeas petition should be irrelevant as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.743" offset="869247">Our view about that is that Rule 9(a) governs the analysis of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.727" offset="885129">There's a second issue here about Lonchar's subjective motive for filing as of June 1995.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.970" offset="910102">Our position there is that subjective motive should not be a subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.775" offset="933403">If it's a substantial petition, an objectively substantial petition, then it ought to be treated just like a petition for relief in any other kind of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.918" offset="1013965">Well, take it just as a hypothetical, not necessarily this case, but you're saying motive is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.223" offset="1039147">What if a first habeas petitioner says, I think I've got some good claims here, but I really don't care what the court does, I really just want to make fools of these judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.122" offset="1106752">The only reason that motive was injected into the inquiry here was because the district judge put Mr. Lonchar on the stand and asked him what his motives were.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.919" offset="1145935">Our view is, that's not a proper subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.491" offset="1156175">If there's a verification on record, as there was on this case, signed under penalty of perjury pursuant to Habeas Rule 2, that the petitioner genuinely wishes to pursue the claim for relief, that should be the end of the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.743" offset="1229214">That's right in the habeas rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.012" offset="1234334">If there's no substantial claim for relief, the petition may be dismissed on its face, but here there are very substantial claims for relief, and there's no doubt about that, and when substantial claim for relief is alleged, as it was here, this case, a first Federal habeas petition, should be treated just like an antitrust case, a labor case, a civil case generally under Rule 11, and pursued on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.559" offset="2244541">I don't want to argue your case for you, but it seems to me there's another point to be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.711" offset="2269096">Usually when we talk about or when we condemn an application as being made solely for delay, the implication is that it really is not made with a belief in the merits asserted, that it is either in bad faith or it's on the verge of bad faith, and that it's explicable only as a device to postpone an execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.999" offset="2374213">In this case, as I understand it, the finding of delay was made on the understanding that he wanted to preserve his life long enough to see a change in the method of execution so that he could donate his vital organs to... I don't know, to science, or an organ bank, or something or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.155" offset="2466895">That isn't delay in sort of the classic sense that has been condemned, is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="587.878" offset="2493749">In other words, a person... if I want to preserve my life, I can then give it away, or throw it away, or do anything I want to with it if I succeed, and that's what your client wants to do, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.631" offset="7492750">And now we'll get back to a secondary point on that, is that obviously on certain claims there was no prejudice because they had already been litigated on the merits, and that was the secondary problem we had with pleading delay as a general principle and pleading 9(a) as a general principle, and I didn't want to misrepresent to the Court that we couldn't respond to all of the claims because I think we probably could have, although how quickly and how thoroughly I could have done so would have been a different matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.674" offset="12964985">Your Honor, if we were asking the Court to do just that and to engage in an entire new line of lawmaking or decisionmaking, then I think this case presents certain factual problems that make it more difficult to engage in general rulemaking, because it's not the general case, but we're not asking the Court to go off making new broad-ranging rules because we don't... under the circumstances of the case, we simply don't need them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.778" offset="13057354">Yes, this case presents a classic example of we got two different last minute petitions being filed, two different stays of executions at the very last minute, which could have come up certainly much earlier in the proceedings.</text>
