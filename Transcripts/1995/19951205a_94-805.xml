Johnson, and I think their opinion is clear that they did not believe that incumbency protection should be considered a traditional districting principle because it was not among those listed in the Shaw v. Reno case to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.884" offset="728097">It is our contention that the determination of what is a customary and traditional districting principle is something that is determined by the State and its practices, its historical practices, and there was no doubt that in this case there's plenty of evidence to show that Texas has followed the traditional practice of incumbency protection to decide where it's going to draw its districts, and incumbency protection as applied by the Texas legislature, certainly in the 1990's, really has four aspects, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.364" offset="854008">First, it is not pairing incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.587" offset="862889">It will not vote for a plan that does not pair incumbents, simply because they want to preserve the State's congressional seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.881" offset="892042">Second, it means that if you're going to have to redraw districts, which they had to because of the fact that the population had increased so greatly in Texas that we had been reapportioned three different districts, that you try to maintain the constituency of each of the Congresspeople.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.499" offset="9286543">What the district court found exactly was that Texas, quote, repeatedly segregated African American, Hispanic, and Anglo populations by race 1) to further the prospects of incumbent officeholders... I'm adding the one... or 2) to create majority minority congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.700" offset="9355297">These districts were conceived for the purpose of providing safe seats in Congress for two African American representatives and Hispanic representatives.</text>

Slagle litigation that she shed black voters in the South Dallas area, and she testified because they tend to be more transient, they tend to not turn out as well, and so then, in order to preserve the single raceness of the district she went north into Colin County, west into Tarrant County, hither and yon in order to gather as many blacks as possible in order to preserve that as a single race majority district.</text>
