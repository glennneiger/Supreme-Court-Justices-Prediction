            <text syncTime="25.829" offset="250468">The specifications ensured that dioxin would be produced, which the United States knew, and the Government also knew, and the court of appeals expressly found that dioxin is an extremely hazardous substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.477" offset="301041">Petitioners knew none of these facts, and the United States knew them and declined to divulge any of that information to the United States... or, excuse me, to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.822" offset="334478">The Agent Orange that was produced by the petitioners was done so in strict conformity to the requirements of the United States, and the United States then used it in unheard of concentrations and exposed thousands of American military and others to the risks that arise from the dioxin.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.157" offset="615764">That says nothing, though, about what ought to be the relationship between the contractors and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.932" offset="634886">It seems to me quite clear that in defining that relationship you have to look to the basic law of... the basic Federal common law, and what rules make sense there.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.590" offset="757557">The lodgings that were filed with the Court demonstrate the existence of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.464" offset="773021">The Tucker Act expressly waives sovereign immunity for all contract claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.528" offset="789322">We're simply trying to ascertain the broad outlines of what's within those contracts based on principles this Court has long followed in terms of when do you imply either indemnification agreements or warranties based on the relationship between the parties and the course of conduct between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.096" offset="851598">The litigation in this particular case arose in the wake of the initial settlements that were done by the petitioners after they were sued by the... those who had been exposed to Agent Orange.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.993" offset="899141">Mr. Phillips, with respect to that, suppose this case had developed that Judge Pratt's acceptance of the Government's contractor defense had stuck, that there had been no change of district judges, and he had entered that judgment, an appeal is taken, and the companies are concerned about how the court of appeals would resolve the Government contractor defense, so they settle, precisely the terms that we have before us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.685" offset="1029962">They settle, and then they want to be reimbursed by the Government for the cost of that settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.734" offset="1086073">They would unquestionably have a claim under an implied indemnification theory, because it is well settled under standard contract rules that if you are indemnified against losses, that whatever losses arise out of your course of conduct, assuming you're an innocent party, are recoverable.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.180" offset="1183875">That's... they don't want to take a chance on losing on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.214" offset="1200071">They've won in the district court, and yet you say that the Government would be responsible under the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.839" offset="1234553">Yes, Your Honor, under an implied indemnification, which is either a variant of Spearin, or a concept that you ought to take directly from Ryan Stevedoring, where the nature of the relationship between the parties demonstrates the kind of control that we're talking about here, where you have compelled production, you have precise specifications, and you have superior knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.091" offset="1311562">In that situation, you would ordinarily... in an ordinary agency relationship you would immediately assume indemnification, and that--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="299.416" offset="1344894">But if the law is as a Government contractor you have a complete defense to the tort action, if that's what the law is, and then the manufacturers say, yes, we urge that that was the law, it was accepted by the court that that was the law, but we know those courts of appeals are not reliable, so we're going to settle rather than risk a reversal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="328.667" stopTime="458.112">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="328.667" offset="1461818">--As I understand the standard rules of damages in an indemnification arrangement, the fact that you had to expend moneys under any circumstances is recoverable against the indemnitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.693" offset="1509988">Now, the question is, were the expenditures reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.066" offset="1523467">That is, has the indemnitee in some sense squandered the assets of the indemnitor?</text>
            <text syncTime="349.320" offset="1544470">Now, in your hypothetical, you could argue that you're getting close to that, because in some situation where you have an absolute slam dunk winner, it may be that it would be inappropriate to settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.475" offset="1585116">In the facts of our case, obviously, that's not what we faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.098" offset="1595565">We didn't have a guaranteed defense, and we weren't even being supported by the United States as part of that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.691" offset="1617926">The other portion of why an indemnification fits neatly into this whole arrangement is that under standard indemnification law the Government would, as an indemnitor, be in a position to step into the shoes of the indemnitee and therefore take over the defense, and if, under those circumstances the Government wanted to ensure 1) that no settlements would go forward that they hadn't approved of, they could exercise that right, but they would have to take over the defense under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.047" offset="1723356">But it seems to me that that's just standard indemnification law as it would apply in the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.571" offset="1745508">Now, with respect to breach of warranty, the issue is a little less clear because the causation requirement between a breach of warranty and the particular damages is less clearly supported by the position that you're entitled not only to recover anything that you spend in consequence of a judgment, but that you're also entitled to any settlement that you reasonably enter into.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.336" offset="1824502">I think part of the reason why it's less clear is because you don't have the indemnitor there to protect itself, and under those circumstances, the courts take, I think, a much harder look at whether or not the particular damages were caused by the particular breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.244" offset="1880195">But here, we're dealing with a situation of summary judgment, and we've not had an opportunity to prove any of those relationships under the circumstances in this case, and I'm confident that if we get back to the claims court and we can demonstrate that the specifications create both breaches of warranty and breaches... and that the... and indemnification rights, we'll be able to demonstrate under the traditional common law rules that otherwise would apply precisely how the damages ought to flow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.888" offset="4510726">First of all, I think consistent with the way the Court analyzed the relationship between tort claims and contract claims in Hatzlachh, in Hatzlachh you recall, that was the case of an implied bailment agreement and there was also a tort claims immunity, and there was also the right to go against individual officers in order to recover, and the Court said the availability of that remedy in no way undermined the ability to get a contract remedy and, therefore, under the facts of our case, the availability of a "remedy Boyle" shouldn't in any way deprive us of what otherwise would be a valid contract remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.490" offset="4637159">I think the logic of Hatzlachh applies here directly, but I also think the importance of Boyle is that it require... is that if we're right, and we are entitled to be indemnified under these circumstances, what that means is that the Government's exposure to liability will be significantly reduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.726" offset="6514109">In our view, there are three related reasons why petitioner's implied warranty claim in this case should fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.328" offset="6540440">Let me touch on them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.540" offset="6545351">I think the Court has already touched on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.020" offset="6551307">First, judicial implication of what amounts here to an open ended indemnity against third party product liability claims brought years after performance is completed under the contract would be unreasonable as a matter of straightforward contract interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.992" offset="6607105">Second, it would be unnecessary, because even on petitioner's view of the facts, because of the existence of the Government contractor defense to tort liability, there is no unfairness here in this kind of situation, and third, it would be unwise, because it would permit exactly the kind of cost shifting to the Government that this Court has held would impermissibly undermine the Government's retention of immunity from suit for exercise of its discretionary functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.719" offset="6722043">Now, we start out by saying what we all know here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.610" offset="7761612">Well, I think our answer to that is, of course one interprets a contract in light of the surrounding circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.191" offset="7779898">A contract implied in fact is one that is taken not out of the court's views of what is just or right, but out of what it believes the parties might reasonably have... either did agree to through their course of contract or their words, or might reasonably have agreed to, and there's obviously a gray area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2051.706" offset="8353965">There is another provision just... I could go on, but there's another provision... this one is not cited in our brief... 10 U.S. Code section 2354, which happens to have to do with military R&amp;D contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.668" offset="8413838">It looks like an indemnity, it talks like an indemnity, and Congress put it there specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.630" offset="8433691">Now, the Government does not impliedly agree to indemnify people for open ended liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.284" offset="8452290">Now, another reason why, and this, I think, goes back to your point about, when we're interpreting a contract with the Government we think about what the Government might have had in mind, and in this case the Government would have had in mind that it is immune from tort liability for injuries that allegedly arise from the exercise of its discretionary functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.138" offset="8531702">Now, the Court made it very clear in Boyle that the discretionary function exemption in tort law covers design decisions for military equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.594" offset="8565557">Now, we're not saying, under Hatzlachh, that that precludes the Court from reading this contract to include an indemnity or warranty provision, but it strongly suggests to us that the Government would not have wanted to enter in, sub silentio, to a warranty provision that would have completely vitiated that important immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.905" offset="9198765">Why should they bother to invoke that when they've got an indemnity from the Government?</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.978" offset="9271072">But in any event, if you look at any of the circumstances where the Government provides warranties and there's an executive order after 50 U.S. Code 1431, which I mentioned before, that goes into great detail about how to do indemnities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.337" offset="9328541">That's one place you will find that they look like an indemnity clause in a sophisticated private contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.684" offset="12493955">About the Government contractor defense, would you please remind me of how that played out?</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.608" offset="12509629">Judge Pratt said, I accept that defense, and then there were some proceedings before Judge Weinstein where I understand the Government didn't simply stand aside, but it argued affirmatively against the Government contractor defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.135" offset="12571696">--It's important to understand the sequence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.208" offset="12580055">Judge Pratt rendered summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.818" offset="12586429">He withheld the final judgment in order to give the defendants the benefit of certifying the class before he entered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.723" offset="12610043">As it turned out, he then relinquished control of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.233" offset="12620074">Judge Weinstein took over, and he simply revoked the prior summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.626" offset="12633658">Now, as far as I understand it, he did not question the availability of the defense, he questioned whether it could be established without trial, so he revoked the summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.661" offset="12665841">Now, he then... eventually the parties settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.816" offset="12686425">That case went away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.458" offset="12696979">Now, he... Judge Weinstein at the same time, you have to understand, had revoked the summary judgment that had been granted to the Government on grounds of Feres and the discretionary function exception, so he was bringing everyone back in and saying, I'm going to send you to trial and we're going to find out what happened here, and then we'll sort out the legal issues after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.948" offset="12766987">Now, after the settlement, and after that litigation was effectively over, there was opt out litigation of the people who opted out of the class, and they brought... their proceedings were continuing, and those proceedings, at the behest of the manufacturers, including Thompson and Hercules, Judge Weinstein also went back on his ruling on the third party liability claim as to certain people who were not servicemen but were relatives of servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.305" offset="12864372">So in that context, we filed a motion saying, listen, if you are talking about a group of plaintiffs, and you're telling us that the Government is not immune as a matter of tort law, then there's no reason for the Government contractor defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.451" offset="12905018">You've kicked out the props on which the Government contractor defense rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.784" offset="12922363">And so if you're going to do that to us, then it seems like you shouldn't have the Government contractor defense for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.677" offset="12941903">That's section 1 of our submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.859" offset="12946605">Now, section 2 of our submission is several reasons... and it's in the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.110" offset="12959666">I commend it to you... several reasons why there might be factual issues about the applicability of the Government contractor defense, but no court in that action either Judge Pratt, Judge Weinstein, or the Second Circuit, ever suggested that there was doubt about the availability of a Government contractor defense if you established the factual prerequisites for its application, and I think that's quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.193" offset="13047960">Just to sum up, again, we think that it's unreasonable as a matter of contract law to think that the Government would have agreed to this kind of indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.689" offset="13081919">It is unnecessary if a Feres justification is required because of the existence of the Government contractor defense and perhaps Section 707, and it would be quite unwise, because it would gut the Government's immunities in a way that this Court specifically rejected in interpreting the Government contractor defense itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.684" offset="13173870">Let me begin with Judge Plager's dissenting opinion in the court below that the law affords substantially more justice than the majority below conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.870" offset="13206680">The United States at the podium here today did not defend the court of appeal's decision on causation, and essentially did not defend the court of appeal's interpretation of the Defense Production Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.555" offset="13245446">On that basis alone, you ought to vacate and send it back to allow us an opportunity to demonstrate the precise contours and the nature of the relationship between the indemnification and breach of warranty claims that we think this Court has already acknowledged and recognized can be readily implied in the ordinary contracts, and that ought to be applied--</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.029" offset="13319320">Mr. Phillips, that argument, if this were a court of error correction, if this were a court of appeals and errors, that might be a very sympathetic argument, but in terms of the question on which we granted certiorari, the law that we are making not for this peculiar case, but for the class of cases, how does that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.411" offset="13400822">--Justice Ginsburg, I would answer that by reference to Justice Breyer's question, when he said that people who deal in Government contracts, and I'm not one of them, look at things like Spearin claims and Helene Curtis claims and other claims, and the truth is, what this Court ought to hold in the context of this case is that this is a Hercules and Thompson claim, where you have compulsion, and specifications, and superior knowledge all combined in one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.987" offset="13487131">It is perfectly fair and just to imply within the contours of that contract that there will be an indemnification.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.364" offset="13724636">Under that theory of law, which I think applies here, I'd ask the Court to reverse and send it back for further proceedings.</text>
