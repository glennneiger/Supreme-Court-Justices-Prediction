            <text syncTime="911.688" offset="3792921">Why isn't the answer to that that in fact Alabama was not punishing anything other than Alabama conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="920.497" offset="3828134">On the analogy with the argument which is common in the enhanced damage area in criminal law, we say, well, the enhanced penalty is not a further punishment for prior crimes which may be considered, and why do we not look at the Alabama rule as simply saying Alabama says if you've done it in other States, you better watch it here, because we're going to sock you hard as a result of it?</text>

            <text syncTime="979.074" offset="4062505">Now, the Alabama supreme court was quite clear, and I don't see how anybody could fail to conclude each additional sale that took place outside of Alabama was punished an additional 4,000 by this jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.170" offset="9602867">One is that they didn't say... this language is pretty standard in their cases, we reduce to the maximum amount, and we don't find it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.684" offset="9632960">And the second thing is that when we realized this and followed up on it we found one other Alabama case where, because of peculiarity of posture, the court had before it a remittitur where there was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.694" offset="9692937">The error in that case was found to be genuine bias by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.117" offset="9706625">That case was the Harmon case at 525 Southern 2d 411, and it seems clear from the face of that opinion that in that case where there was a tainted jury verdict Alabama supreme court did not remit to the maximum possible amount but to something less than that, because it said, since this was a tainted award, the plaintiff, if it rejects this remittitur, will not be bound to this as the maximum that it can seek, so they plainly didn't think they were imposing the maximum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.700" offset="12248967">What's most interesting... so at best what they were saying was, okay, we've been caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.195" offset="12270909">We promise from now on we will reduce the amount of fraud that we commit in Alabama, because what they weren't willing to say is, we will disclose, because they couldn't just disclose in Alabama without disclosing nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.223" offset="12323050">There was no way they... even when they wanted to fix this problem, they couldn't fix it by disclosing it in Alabama because, since they knew cars came from other States, they'd have to disclose in other States as well, and they didn't want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.910" offset="12369861">And so the first argument we made, and I want to defend the court here today on the ground it itself used, which is, it didn't consider the out of state at all, but the first argument we made in our brief is that they were entitled to look at the out of state conduct in this case, because BMW had constructed an engine that was a nationwide engine and couldn't figure out a way to tailor it so that it wouldn't do harm to Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.653" offset="13788833">I'd like to answer Justice Breyer's question with a procedural reason why it violates due process not to divide, as you suggested, and to allow Dr. Gore to collect the full amount, and that reason comes... you can see it from the first issue in Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts, which was the standing of the defendant to complain about the plaintiffs, jurisdiction over the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.177" offset="13874932">What you have here is a one way class action under which, if BMW wins, it gets no credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.950" offset="13901995">It won the Yates case on punitive damages, zero punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.944" offset="13917982">Now along comes Dr. Gore, and BMW loses the Dr. Gore case, and the jury imposes the full punishment necessary to deter the entire conduct everywhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.372" offset="13959674">That is manifestly unfair to BMW, because what it does not allow for is the fact that every other jury that hears this might find that there is no punishable conduct.</text>
