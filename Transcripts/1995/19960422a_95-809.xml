            <text syncTime="13.162" offset="195862">It is, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.773" offset="198370">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.665" offset="213939">This case presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.246" offset="224284">The first involves whether Lockheed Corporation breached a fiduciary duty when it amended its pension plan to provide an incentive for employees to early retire and included as one of the eligibility criteria of that amendment the requirement that employees who were voluntarily retiring sign a release of employment-related claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.690" offset="309965">There's no dispute that that amendment that Lockheed adopted complies with the minimum benefit accrual, minimum vesting, and minimum participation standards required by ERISA, and there's also no doubt that whether participants, employees who took advantage of this increased retirement benefit, did so voluntarily, which is to say, they voluntarily did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.756" offset="398259">It was not... it was a new benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.188" offset="407977">No employee who opted to choose this increased pension benefit had to give up anything he or she was otherwise entitled to prior to the existence of this benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.332" offset="448623">The second issue also raised by Mr. Spink in this because of his unique circumstances goes to whether the amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and ERISA by OBRA 1986, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, should... whether Congress intended that those changes be applied retroactively.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.785" offset="574429">In your petition for certiorari you asked whether the Ninth Circuit correctly held that a pension plan sponsor can be liable for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA when it amended the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.933" offset="630958">Then, in the merits brief you say when the pension plan sponsor and plan fiduciaries may be held liable, blah, blah, blah, and you appear to be raising some additional questions in the merits brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.253" offset="696264">Well, I don't... I believe it's the same question that's being raised, Justice O'Connor, because what the Ninth Circuit held... it didn't make a big distinction between the plan sponsor and the retirement plan committee that would pay the benefits to eligible employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.210" offset="848088">--The first point, Your Honor, there are petitioners in this case, including the individuals who are on the retirement committee as well as the executives of Lockheed, who were sued in their executive capacity because they adopted or had the company adopt the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.577" offset="901586">But you're correct, the Solicitor General has raised, really for the first time, a distinction possibly between implementation of a lawfully amended plan with a lawful amendment on the one hand and whether actually adopting the amendment on the other are separate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.058" offset="971490">Now, in this case the Ninth Circuit didn't make that distinction and, indeed, I think respondent in their opposition doesn't make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.875" offset="1010778">They call it a false distinction, because whether it's analyzed as a question of plan implementation or whether it's analyzed as a question of plan amendment, the key issue in this case on the first issue is, does it violate any substantive requirement of ERISA--</text>

            <text syncTime="234.537" offset="1081413">I thought the question was whether it violated a fiduciary responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.467" offset="1097087">It is entirely possible that the plan sponsor might violate no fiduciary responsibility and yet violate some substantive bar to that particular amendment, and I thought we only had the first question in front of us.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.638" offset="1389763">The adoption of the provision by itself was not unlawful because it was a settlor function, but even if... even if it were not a settlor function, the substantive provision of this amendment doesn't constitute a prohibited action under ERISA section 406.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.406" offset="1448904">Now, what the district court held, and really no one has taken issue with this in the Ninth Circuit decision or under the petitions here, and it held at page 31a of the petition, and I will... appendix 31a of the petition, and the nub of this case is held up in the third line: indeed, the sole fiduciary duty implicated by the amendment was the duty owed to defendant stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.926" offset="1563007">The court views the subsequent payment of enhanced benefits to selected participants as merely the defendant's adherents in his role as plan administrator for the terms of the lawfully amended plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.452" offset="1609087">Now, what the Ninth Circuit held is, the whole scheme, amending the plan and paying benefits, that whole entire scheme is a violation of ERISA section 406, because it... what has happened, the plan has been amended, employees have volunteered to retire, and they are now receiving the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.894" offset="1678782">And what the Solicitor is suggesting is that a plan fiduciary who is complying... there's no doubt that the fiduciaries that are paying the benefits are complying with the terms of the plan, so what is the fiduciary to do if the question remains open, which the Ninth Circuit didn't really leave open--</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.943" offset="13351023">I mean, by its text it says the amendments made only apply to plan years beginning after January, on or after January 1, and only with respect to service performed on or after such date.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.261" offset="13400342">--There's no necessary relationship, though, between those participation statutes and the benefit accrual statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.365" offset="13420718">As we demonstrated in our brief, benefit accrual calculations can include all manner of provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.268" offset="13444333">There are baseline minimum calculation standards that need to be met, but the formula itself can be... can partake of various factors, service, excess salary... it can be a plain lump sum at the end of a... or a percentage of salary without regard to years of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.072" offset="13523536">So it is... there's nothing in the statute to indicate that these two provisions, 9203 and its effective date, were designed to be superimposed on separate provisions, 9201 and 9202, which has a separate effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.553" offset="13585498">Lockheed did not answer many of the questions raised in our brief, including why are there two effective date provisions if Congress intended this separate provision, which is only a couple of lines down from the other one, to apply to the other provisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.671" offset="13637952">It's just... they're trying to carve out an exception in the statute that doesn't exist there, and on pages 4024 and 25 of the U.S. Code and Congressional and Administrative News in 1986 which deals with OBRA, Congress said we recognize there are funding issues, and therefore we're going to implement the delayed retirement... excuse me, the delayed normal retirement age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.107" offset="13735650">They didn't say, and there can be other things you can do to deal with the funding issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.831" offset="13758533">Under funding statutes, under ERISA generally, the funding for those benefits don't begin until the effective date.</text>
