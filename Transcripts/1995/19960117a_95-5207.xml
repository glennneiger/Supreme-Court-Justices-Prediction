            <text syncTime="1429.025" offset="5852698">The burden of proof at issue here today is not a stand-alone provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.028" offset="5868789">It is part of a procedure, a system involved in the State of Oklahoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.047" offset="6044855">It is then placed upon the State to show the defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt as part of the elements that are proved in the case-in-chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.232" offset="6077560">The other question by Justice Breyer was what happens if a defendant is by physical problems rendered incapable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.110" offset="6109116">The example of coma was given, and the statutes of the State of Oklahoma on determination of competency at 1175.1 et seq provide not only for the mental ability to proceed but also incompetency by reason of physical disability.</text>
