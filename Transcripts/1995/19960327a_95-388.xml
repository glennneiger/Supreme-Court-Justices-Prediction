            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="12.008" offset="185876">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.562" offset="196116">This case brings before the Court an important question under the implied labor exemption to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.666" offset="228508">At issue is the legality of unilateral action in the labor market taken by the 28 clubs of the National Football League which enjoy monopsony power.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.493" offset="279812">Using the considerable enforcement authority of the Commissioner of the league, the clubs unilaterally imposed a drastic salary restraint by eliminating competition for a small minority of the 1,600 players of the National Football League.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.779" offset="368942">Specifically, the restraint fixed the compensation of developmental squad players at a parsimonious $16,000 for the regular season in 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.620" offset="432367">The court below, reversing Judge Lamberth, shielded the NFL clubs from antitrust scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.254" offset="462878">The court found a complete repugnancy between antitrust and collective bargaining, and in the process gave professional sports leagues virtually the same exemption from antitrust scrutiny that only baseball had previously enjoyed, and that Congress has never seen fit to grant, and Congress knows full well how to create exemptions from the antitrust laws, as it did so explicitly in the statutory labor exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.456" offset="599655">For three reasons, we submit respectfully the result below should not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.650" offset="624419">First and foremost, our primary submission, there is no clear conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.884" offset="653363">There is no repugnancy between antitrust and labor policy in this particular setting of a competitive labor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.083" offset="690144">To the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.012" offset="693905">For many years, from this Court's decision in Radovich through the seminal case of Mackey v. The National Football League and then beyond, McCourt from the Sixth Circuit, applying the Mackey analysis for professional hockey, the sports world, albeit subject to antitrust scrutiny with respect to restraints in the labor market--</text>

            <text syncTime="169.642" offset="816472">This Court has not had occasion to address this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.285" offset="830996">There have been, Your Honor, a number... Mr. Chief Justice, a number of lower court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.538" offset="851998">Mackey, the Eighth Circuit decision, articulated what was for many years the subtle standard and applied in a wide variety of cases, and as a result, the sports world, although it was subject to antitrust scrutiny with respect to restraints in the labor market, enjoyed labor peace and a moderation of what would otherwise have been very extreme and rigid restraints and limitations on employee freedom, the economic freedom of players, which is ultimately what is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.031" offset="985954">Not only is history and practical experience reflected by the 30 years of antitrust history, not only is history and practical experience a sure guide to the court in its decision here today, but so, too, is basic theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.382" offset="1167348">The 1950's.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.524" offset="1175917">This Court recognized the implied labor exemption in a series of cases in the 1960's.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.288" offset="1202979">Antitrust scrutiny had been traditionally applied, other than to baseball... this Court's historic decision in baseball had historically been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.624" offset="1240387">After this Court articulated the implied labor exemption, numerous courts, led, first, by the Eighth Circuit, which was the first circuit to address this extensively in the 1970's, in the Mackey case, invalidated the Rozelle rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.716" offset="1312694">The Rozelle rule was challenged by players who were tied to the team under the reserve clause the Rozelle rule, tied to the team for which they were playing which had drafted them for the entirety of their careers.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.557" offset="1388135">The Eighth Circuit said, we apply a rule of reason analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.431" offset="1407571">There is no exemption from antitrust scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.894" offset="1421468">And why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.412" offset="1423557">What is it that makes professional sports different than the other conventional industries that have shared with the Court concerns that to adopt the rule that has been embraced, now, for many, many years, until Powell and then recent decisions including--</text>

            <text syncTime="361.240" offset="1582800">Powell still applied Mackey to say, for there to be an implied labor exemption there must have been an agreed to term.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.721" offset="1772762">Under circumstances where employers are coming together to determine, what are our proposals going to be to the players association and the like, formulating those proposals and the like, are, I believe, protected by the implied labor exemption, which does what?</text>
            <text syncTime="427.424" offset="1847577">It is, at its core, protecting the ability of employees through their labor organization to come together with employers through collective bargaining to reach an agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.182" offset="1998565">We think that by virtue of the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act, two laws passed by the Congress of the United States, the issue is, is there repugnancy to applying the antitrust laws to this particular setting?</text>

            <text syncTime="482.363" offset="2067319">We know it from practical experience, but we also know that the other side's essential submission is, well, you see, if you allow antitrust scrutiny, that will end multiemployer bargaining, and we know that not to be true.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.495" offset="6279825">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.371" offset="6307306">I would like to begin by following up on one of Mr. Starr's answers to Justice Breyer's question, and that is a question, or an answer about the choice required of certain unionized employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.489" offset="6347848">I agree with petitioners that in certain unionized industries employees have a choice to make, but it is not the choice that petitioners assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.916" offset="6385569">It is not a choice between labor law rights and whatever antitrust rights they may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.438" offset="6403646">The choice, instead, is between collective bargaining with a single employer that bargains independently, and collective bargaining with a multiemployer bargaining unit, a group of employers that bargain collectively as if they were a single entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.115" offset="6454323">The problem with petitioner's position is that they want to have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.268" offset="6474908">They want to take full advantage of the enormous benefits which this Court recognized in Bonanno Linen that employees receive when employers act collectively in the bargaining process, but at the same time, they also want to exploit the leverage of the antitrust laws which they can do only by claiming that each member of the multiemployer unit is required to act not collectively but independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.504" offset="6567904">That fundamental inconsistency pervades petitioners' every argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.116" offset="6586294">From the standpoint of the union, multiemployer bargaining is voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.530" offset="6603953">The union may withdraw its consent at any time before the bargaining process begins, but once it begins, multiemployer bargaining is a bilateral process providing rights and obligations that both sides must observe, and that neither side can escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.910" offset="6661526">That was the essence of this Court's opinion in Bonanno Linen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.144" offset="6674483">Once bargaining began, each employer was bound by its election to engage in multiemployer bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.311" offset="7327126">The board made clear that among the economic weapons available to the employers after impasse was to implement unilaterally the terms of its last good faith bargaining proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.247" offset="7370803">The board has spoken on that, and in its decisions the board has repeatedly made clear in contexts involving multiemployer bargaining that unilateral implementation of the last good faith bargaining proposal is a... is part and parcel of the collective bargaining process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.220" offset="7434751">Now, it was only a few months ago, in the Silverman case, which we cited at page 30 of our brief, when the major league baseball implemented a unilateral terms and conditions of employment, that the baseball players went to the board, and the board agreed with the baseball players' position that that term had not been unilaterally implemented in accordance with the labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.423" offset="7519597">And only 6 weeks later the NLRB had obtained an injunction against the court... against the baseball employers' implementation of that term, and that's exactly what the football players should have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.681" offset="7572573">They had a remedy if they were of the view that the unilateral implementation of these terms was not in good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.186" offset="7770581">And in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion, Justice Stevens pointed out that the individual employer who wanted to withdraw from the multiemployer unit in Bonanno Linen knew what the rules were when it chose voluntarily to participate in the multiemployer bargaining process, and he wrote that there was nothing inappropriate about requiring that employer to abide by those rules throughout the bargaining process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.654" offset="12648478">I won't take much of your time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.645" offset="12652449">If, as you say, the employers cannot continue to bargain as a unit once there's been impasse, and each one has to bargain on his own, are they... is each one, in bargaining on his own, limited to the last offer that had been made in the bargaining process?</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.637" offset="12732384">Our premise is not that there cannot be bargaining after impasse.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.067" offset="12850144">That is to say, it may be that if you depart from that last term, and you unilaterally impose... it's complicated, Your Honor, but I'm being very brief on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.033" offset="12882013">That is, if you depart from your last offer that may... may... be evidence of bad faith bargaining on the part of the... but if I may, what is at issue... I have about 2 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.401" offset="12927466">What is at issue here is this stark choice that has been... that I think Justice O'Connor has captured, an unappetizing choice that I think Mr. Levy has been very clear about, that the real remedy is, in fact, to decertify, and that is a stark choice that this Court has held in a number of its backdrop posit... backdrop opinions, Metropolitan Life, Fort Halifax, and Livadas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.422" offset="13063512">Well, that is a real... the broad point that I think those cases stand for, Your Honor, and I cite the Court's language in Fort Halifax that both employers and employees come to the bargaining table with a backdrop, and that is to say that this does not repeal the Fair Labor Standards Act, does not repeal OSHA and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.878" offset="13153373">Those are backdrop rights that the parties can bargain about, but Fort Halifax makes it enormously clear that there is, in fact, an ability on the part of an employee, a union, to in fact invoke those backdrop rights, and that is a very critical part of the understanding of the structure of the labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.574" offset="13244175">And, in fact, in terms of national labor policy, let us remember what this case is about: an effort to secure an implied exemption from the antitrust laws when... and I don't think this is obscure at all... the National Labor Relations Board has concluded that this is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.006" offset="13321915">The D.C. Circuit's decision is wrong as a matter of law and may do serious harm to labor policy, and why is that the stark choice.</text>
