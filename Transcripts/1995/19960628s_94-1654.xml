            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="4.347" offset="98364">I have the opinion to announce in Board of County Commissioners, Wabaunsee County, Kansas versus Umbehr, No. 94-1654.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.026" offset="145071">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.495" offset="170985">The issue in the case is whether and to what extent the First Amendment protects independent contractors from the termination of at-will government contracts in retaliation for the exercise of the contractor’s right of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.446" offset="238799">As of 1991, the respondent Keen Umbehr had been the exclusive provider of solid waste disposal services for Wabaunsee County for ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.903" offset="284565">A contract was subject to annual renewal which occurred automatically unless either party gave notice of non-renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.578" offset="315285">During that period, he had been an outspoken critic of the petitioner, the Board of County Commissioners at meetings and in local newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.419" offset="350603">Umbehr had accused the Board of various forms of mismanagement and at some violations of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.210" offset="377770">Umbehr’s complaint alleges that in 1991, the Board gave him notice of non-renewal and terminated its commercial relationship with it in retaliation for that criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.303" offset="426149">Umbehr sued the Board under 42 U.S. Code Section 1983 asserting a violation of its First Amendment right of freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.562" offset="467213">The District Court granted summary judgment to the Board on the basis that the First Amendment affords no protection against termination of contracts with independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.229" offset="513920">The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.817" offset="528235">It held first that independent government contractors are protected from termination of the contract in retaliation for their speech on matters of public concern just as government employees would be, and second that the limits on that protection that this Court has recognized in the context of government employment contracts is applicable to contractors as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.012" offset="633039">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm that Tenth Circuit’s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.430" offset="666684">We apply the analysis of our government employee precedence to determine the rights of independent government contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.002" offset="696986">Both parties argued that independent contractors are different from employee in relevant respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.213" offset="721855">Umbehr argues that because independent contactors such as himself typically do not work as closely with government personnel as to government employees and are not as closely associated with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.579" offset="775249">That the government’s interests contractor cases are attenuated and should receive closer scrutiny then we give them in government employment contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.925" offset="812657">The Board argues that contractors are typically less dependent on the government and less subject to government control sort of termination and should therefore enjoy less protection on employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.959" offset="860826">These arguments are not without force but they cut those ways and we think the parties' points are better accommodate within our traditional analysis which allows for a balancing of the interest of the government and the contractor rather than by a white line distinction between independent contractors and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.585" offset="943269">We therefore apply with appropriate modifications the criteria for liability announced in our government employment precedents such as Pickering versus Board of Education, Mt. Healthy City Board of Education versus Doyle, Connick versus Myers, and Waters versus Churchill.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.925" offset="1012650">We hold independent contractors are constitutionally protected from termination of their commercial relationships with the government in retaliation for their exercise of First Amendment right of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.182" offset="1065731">To prevail, I am very much sure that the Board’s decision to terminate him or was motivated by his speech on the matter of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.339" offset="1098332">If he can do so, the Board will have a valid defense if it can show via preponderance of the evidence, then in light of their knowledge perceptions and policies at the time of the termination, the Board members would have terminated him regardless of his speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.237" offset="1161966">The Board will also prevail if it can show that the County’s legitimate interest as contractor, differentially viewed, outweigh the free speech interest of the contractor at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.503" offset="1207001">We thus affirm the judgment at the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.023" offset="1233019">The Chief Justice has joined all but part 2-B1 of the opinion of the Court; Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
