            <text syncTime="13.300" offset="189977">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.872" offset="208263">Last term, this Court in North Star Steel Company summarized the basic aspects of the WARN Act, which is the statute which generates this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.477" offset="294676">We set out the pertinent portion of the Court's opinion on page 9 of our opening brief, the blue brief, and very simply stated as the Court noted WARN is a statute which puts a condition on employers on plant closings and mass layoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.814" offset="400002">The employer is supposed to notify, among others, each representative of the affected employees if the facility is one in which the employees have an exclusive representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.585" offset="459039">An employer who violates the notice provision is liable for penalties by way of a civil action that may be brought in any district court, and as the court concluded by noting, the class of plaintiffs includes both aggrieved employees or their unions as representatives, who may collect back pay for each day of violation not to exceed 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.962" offset="568544">In this case, the union brought a WARN act case concerning a plant closing, alleging that Brown Group had proceeded without providing the proper notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.045" offset="644926">The Eighth Circuit held that the union did not have standing to bring and prosecute that lawsuit and to seek the statutory remedy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="179.635" offset="855264">--The nature of the notice right is not one which inures to the union as an institution, as a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.252" offset="909703">The point of the act, as the sponsors noted, and we quote this on page 10 of our reply brief, is that as the collective bargaining agent, the exclusive representative, whether it be an international union, a regional union, or a local union, has the responsibility and authority to address changes in terms and conditions of employment, the effects of a plant closing, and cooperative efforts at worker readjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.826" offset="1052018">So the union gets the notice in order to facilitate employee readjustment, retraining, job location, to deal with the employer in ways which may even alleviate the entire problem, and as... what Congress saw is that if the employer does not provide the notice, the union is harmed by losing the opportunity to provide those representative services.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.352" offset="1202170">And what Congress determined was that where the notice isn't provided, and where employees do not get the opportunity to have this period of readjustment with assured income, the closest that was appropriate, because Congress particularly made the judgment that injunctive relief would not lie, that the closest that was appropriate was, in essence, a form of specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.278" offset="1357860">You will get 60 days with this assured money at some point, and have the opportunity, some opportunity for readjustment in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.956" offset="1412612">So the union, by providing the substitute, is redressing the injury that it suffered by this invasion of its legal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.224" offset="1461618">Now, certainly we would not have balked, and I am certain that we lobbied for institutional direct relief as well, but the proposition that this is not relief that redresses the lost opportunities that are generated by the violation of the union's legal right seems to me to be without substance or reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.084" offset="1581050">This is a form of redressing this particular form of legal right.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.969" offset="1848648">I can only say that at the time... this was 1992... people who brought the case read the statute and proceeded in the way that they believed was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.880" offset="1904237">I think one of the reasons Congress did what it did is that for people who are thrown out in the job market, and so on, to be the named plaintiff in this kind of suit is something of a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.072" offset="1985008">You're going to get a certain disinclination among individuals to do that, and this was a purposely simplified approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.230" offset="2037670">I quite agree that you could, and maybe, in the fullness of hindsight, might wish to do a belt and suspenders approach, and both have the union sue and have an individual sue as an aggrieved employee and as a class representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.039" offset="2148848">That's going to complicate the proceedings some, and I can only say that we don't believe it is what Congress required here, any more than it would be required where a union brings a suit of comparable character under a collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.253" offset="2301716">And while it's true, I suppose, that because there's no union member who's a party, there's no one who's a named plaintiff who is going to get damages, but I don't know that that's an Article III problem, so you can still argue that it's like a class action.</text>

I should think the only remedy that is going to redress or vindicate the union's interest in failing to receive the notice would be a remedy that gives them the statutory amount of time to do that, and that remedy would be an injunction against closing the plant short of 60 days for the union to do whatever it wants to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.703" offset="6599590">On a number of occasions in the past 20 or so years this Court has reiterated what it has called the irreducible constitutional minima for standing to sue in the Federal courts, and two of those minimal requirements are involved in this case, in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.962" offset="6664583">The first, of course, is injury in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.185" offset="6673465">this Court's cases require that the injury claimed by the plaintiff be concrete, real, immediate, palpable, not speculative, not conjectural, not abstract, and that injury must be to a legally protectable interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.737" offset="6743682">The second element that's involved in this case is that of redressability, which requires that relief from the injury must be likely to follow for the plaintiff from a favorable decision, and it must redress the injury to the complaining party even though the judgment may benefit others collaterally.</text>
