            <text syncTime="12.569" offset="198452">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="14.930" offset="207856">This case involves the kind of fact intensive decision that district judges make 40,000 times each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.055" offset="236381">It is the type of decision that trial judges are ideally suited to make, that appellate judges have neither the institutional competence nor resources to make, and that Congress and the Sentencing Reform Act explicitly vested in the district courts, and it is the kind of reasoned decisionmaking that Congress expected would provide vital data to the Sentencing Commission's continuous evolution and refinement of the Sentencing Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.393" offset="349753">The sentencing judge in this case made his decision to depart from the Sentencing Guideline range after presiding over a 7-week trial and a lengthy sentencing process involving detailed factual submissions by all of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.004" offset="412133">He explained each aspect of his decision and his reasoning in a 54-page sentencing memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.571" offset="442435">Each reason for departing from the guidelines was well documented and based upon the specific, highly unusual facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.335" offset="481514">Each departure was predicated on factors that are either encouraged as departure grounds by the Sentencing Commission or not forbidden or discouraged by the Sentencing Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.264" offset="525191">It is important to state at the outset that Congress explicitly authorized sentencing judges to depart from the prescribed sentencing ranges if they find factors of a kind or to a degree not taken into consideration by the commission in formulating the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.237" offset="605126">This, according to the commission, requires determining whether a case is unusual, atypical, or outside the heartland of the guideline range prescribed for this particular offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.785" offset="655281">This is a highly fact bound inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.747" offset="667088">Congress stated that sentencing judges were to have the flexibility and were required to impose that... use that flexibility to impose individualized sentences when warranted by aggravating or mitigating factors not taken into account by the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.876" offset="727692">Sentencing judges are to be guided by numerous factors in deciding whether a case is outside the heartland of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.082" offset="760502">As explained for the Court in the Rivera case from the First Circuit, a district judge is going to use the facts of the case, as found by him, to which deference must be given unless they're clearly erroneous, his experience or her experience as a sentencing judge, the intuition developed over years of sentencing, other statutes, the guidelines themselves, the sentencing regime prescribed by the guidelines, and to bring all that institutional superior feel, as the Rivera court put it, together to the case to determine whether a case is unusual or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.853" offset="891532">Mr. Olson, let me ask about the first point that you make in your argument, and which I guess you're coming to now, whether in deciding this question we use the abuse of discretion standard or we decide de novo whether the particular factor is allowable under the guidelines.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="211.431" offset="993828">Because what is being contended by the Government is that certain of these factors are not lawful factors, that the guidelines do not permit them to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.176" offset="1032803">Now, if we reviewed it de novo, we would come to the conclusion, assuming the Government's right, you're right, the guidelines do not permit them to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.803" offset="1063314">If we did it under an abuse of discretion standard, we would say, well, of course it is always an abuse of discretion to violate the law, and therefore we have before us the same question Does the guidelines permit it to be used?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.679" offset="1114827">Whichever standard you use, the appellate court has the same question before it Is it lawful to use this particular factor?</text>

            <text syncTime="250.806" offset="1151399">--The answer to that question is... indeed, the answer, I can state directly that it does make a great deal of difference, because it is an experience that sentencing judges get.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.772" offset="1183268">What the Sentencing Commission intended to occur is that, and the Sentencing Commission specifically said that it is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a Sentencing Commission, so what the Sentencing... to a sentencing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.832" offset="1247425">So what the Sentencing Commission did is elaborate on what the experience of district judges had been and create a typical sentence for a heartland type case, but it--</text>

            <text syncTime="286.950" offset="1295908">The abuse of discretion standard simply says, within this broad range of the unlawful on this side and the unlawful on that side, the court can do whatever it wants in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.658" offset="1338749">Now, when it goes into the unlawful, it automatically abuses its discretion, and the contention here is that certain factors cannot lawfully be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.396" offset="4513776">He said that these things preceded only by seconds the offense conduct, which... and that therefore there was a relationship of substantially contributing to provoking the offense conduct, and I urge the Court to reject again, as a matter of law, the Government's claim that the lack of contemporaneous provocation and offense conduct means that this was an inappropriate guideline to use, that is, the encouraged departure downward for misconduct by the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.125" offset="4620669">However, there is a point here that I think is essential to the Court's resolution of this legal question, and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.266" offset="4641253">As I read the basic philosophy of the guidelines, there is a compartmentalizing of the various elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.621" offset="4674585">For example, in any police misconduct case, whether it's conspiracy to violate someone's right to vote, or whether it's assaulting someone and using unreasonable force, the guidelines gives a formula for addressing punishment to that element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.211" offset="4724950">But there's really a fact based analysis here which sort of prevents the Government from drastically changing the sentence by changing what charges it files, so that the offense conduct element in this case is 15 elements, 15 levels of sentencing for the aggravated assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.662" offset="4786808">I take it that the Government's argument should be rejected that in a police misconduct case you can never give... you can never find victim misconduct mitigating because all the judge did was find that the departure downward for victim misconduct applied to that 15 levels of aggravated assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.584" offset="4854517">In other words, I think there is a limit on that discretion, Your Honor, that if Judge Davies had gone 16 or more levels, and cut into the punishment for the violation of civil rights rather than simply reduced by a third the element of the punishment in this case that addressed the aggravated assault, then I think there would be a fairly strong argument that there was an abuse of discretion in finding the degree of departure to exceed that which was the predicate for the departure, that is, the assault itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.678" offset="5186899">--Justice Breyer, if you're referring to the 3-level combination departure and not including the discussion of the 5 levels for victimless conduct, then yes, I think Your Honor is right that the analysis of that would require the Court to have due regard for the facts and to defer to those aspects, or those factors under the added punishment departure that were experiential and related to what a district judge could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.464" offset="5274043">But where there's a pure question of law, then I think that a circuit court might be able to determine it was an inappropriate factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.726" offset="5295046">However, I would urge caution in the two that the Government have made their strongest points on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.589" offset="5310510">One is this lack of recidivism being prohibited, and the other is the one about the Government making a charging decision to prosecute these defendants again after they'd been prosecuted in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.016" offset="5352202">As I've indicated in, I believe the reply, petitioner's reply brief, the guidelines do address the question of when the court thinks its unfair that the Government has made a particular charging decision and suggests that that might be addressed by a departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.295" offset="5401312">So even though it's legal, completely legal for the Government to choose one charge offense over another, if the Government... if the court in its experience detects a specter of unfairness, the guidelines encourages a district judge to depart downward based on that sense of unfairness, and I would urge the Court not to reach too quickly the conclusion that, because double jeopardy is not violated here, there is no specter of unfairness which a district judge is uniquely qualified to detect, and which the guidelines would prohibit, as a matter of law, the district judge considering in the mix with all the other combined factors in determining that that unfairness should be addressed by a departure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.726" offset="6067016">Each of these combined factors went into some... into a combination or mix factor, and this Court has never determined that once one valid factor is considered, that it is inappropriate for the district judge to be straitjacketed into not considering the whole of the remainder of the case in determining to what degree departure is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.789" offset="6151340">In other words, where the judge says, as in Williams, or for example there's... this is not a combination departure, but there's a departure, and here are the three separate reasons, then I think the remand might be required, or obviously will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.308" offset="6197420">But where the judge says, I think an additional 3-level departure is appropriate, and these are the factors that I'm identifying in combination, that it isn't clear that it would be illegal or, as a matter of law, invalid for a judge to consider the whole of the case, even though some of those factors, if articulated separately, would be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.809" offset="6267428">So I think that there is still some more work to do in drawing the inference that this case fits under Williams, because it's different in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.323" offset="6301387">And I think it's also correct to say that when we look at the other factor, take the question of recidivism, it seems right that at least in the Ninth Circuit at the time this case was decided it was the law that if a person is in category 1 with criminal history, you can't depart downward because you find that he won't reoffend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.285" offset="6373276">It also... and therefore the Government argues that's a prohibited factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.508" offset="6386128">On the other hand, it's not clear that that is all that Judge Davies was doing in discussing the fact that as part of the mix, these defendants were not likely to be a danger to anyone, and that's because in reviewing the reasonableness of a departure the statute says, 37... well, 3742(e)(3) says that it's only in determining whether the departure is unreasonable that the reviewing court should look at those purposes of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.297" offset="6505351">And one of the purposes of sentencing is protection of society, so it's a fair thing for the district judge to talk about whether or not these defendants or this defendant would be a danger in discussing the justification for a particular departure and the level of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.257" offset="6557178">I think it's a question of how this district judge's findings are read, but it is not clear that he used an improper factor, rather, that he included in the mix something which the guidelines require to be given regard to, and that is, whether the person is a danger, because obviously it would be unreasonable to set a dangerous person loose, whereas it might be more reasonable to give a person who is totally not dangerous a lower sentence, so I think it is relevant to whether it's reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.113" offset="7340643">This Court held in Williams v. United States that the reasonableness determination and the component of the statute that you read that refers to that goes only to the second step of whether a resulting sentence is an unreasonably high or low departure from the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.154" offset="7404799">It only goes to magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.654" offset="7410755">The question of whether a departure is permissible in the first place raises two antecedent issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.777" offset="7431235">The first is whether it is a violation of law, which it would be if, for example, a district court departed based on an explicitly socioeconomic factor, or a factor that is so close to a socioeconomic factor as to be a proxy for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.618" offset="7486615">The second issue of law that is antecedent to the reasonableness determination is whether there is a misapplication of the guidelines which could occur, for example, as the Court made clear again in the Williams opinion, if the district court relied on a factor that the Sentencing Commission has explicitly taken into consideration and has given adequate consideration to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.397" offset="7849717">Where the court of appeals have a distinct advantage in that respect is the ability to harmonize the results that are obtained in different district courts throughout the circuit, which may have very different circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.374" offset="7889632">A family circumstance that a district judge in Manhattan may think is a ground for departure may be entirely different from one that a judge sitting in Hartford, Connecticut would think.</text>

            <text syncTime="2602.099" offset="10556525">But it is not the case that simply because a factor was not given adequate consideration by the Sentencing Commission that the courts have found that it thereby licenses district courts to depart.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.633" offset="10634683">Certainly, the commission did not consider that, but that does not mean that it justifies a departure, and the question of whether it does or does not justify a departure, namely whether we are right or wrong, is clearly a question of law that should not be within the bounds of district courts to resolve differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.121" offset="11844675">To take an example in this case, the defendants contended that they can defend, on appeal, the district court's determination to depart under the victim misconduct guideline, 5K2.10, because Rodney King's misconduct substantially contributed to provoking their offense conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.474" offset="11918027">That's their contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.556" offset="11922416">Our reading of the district court's opinion and the court of appeal's reading of the district court's opinion is that the district court didn't really find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.279" offset="11953240">What the district court found is that but for Rodney King's misconduct in sending the police on a chase through the streets of Los Angeles and eventually stopping and acting in a way that led them to believe he was not submitting to arrest and engaging in an attempt to escape, but for those events, the defendants never would have been put in the position where they engaged in the constitutional violation of wilfully using excessive force, which they ultimately did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.918" offset="12055849">Our point of view on that is that but for causation is not the kind of provocation that that guideline contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.373" offset="12089599">We could be right about that, we could be wrong about it, but we believe it's a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.435" offset="12105900">If ultimately, however, a court were to correctly construe the guideline and to understand that it did not mean that but for causation was alone enough, and it then went through and applied the factors to the specific facts of the case, that is the kind of determination that should get some sort of deference on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.596" offset="12178520">So we are not seeking wholly to remove sentencing discretion from district courts either in the decision whether to depart from the guidelines when there's a permissible factor or in the way that they sentence within the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.435" offset="12225854">But we do think that the guidelines contemplate a regime under which two things will happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.758" offset="12243199">One is, the law will be clarified in the court of appeals, and then the Sentencing Commission can react to it if it so chooses, and can amend the guidelines to clarify what the proper principles are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.682" offset="12282905">And that is a process that Congress clearly and specifically contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.635" offset="12294713">And second, to provide a common law development of how the recognized departure factors should be applied in a particular case, so that a district court sitting in New York doesn't think that it's unusual family circumstances if you have one small child under the age of 3 and you've been sentenced to a 10-year drug offense and it was your first time offense, while a different district judge says no, as a matter of law that can't possibly be unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.262" offset="12393142">In our view what the courts of appeals should do is review the decided cases that come to them, which is a very small fraction of the departures to begin with, and then attempt to harmonize the cases and make the facts of the decided cases reconcilable with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.532" offset="12454269">It may be that in carrying out that task the courts of appeals will apply limited deference at first until they gain enough experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.287" offset="12481332">It may also be that after they chart the particular area by deciding enough cases, there will be little law left to develop, and in that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.132" offset="13240659">This case is far closer to the kind of example that the Court considered in Rivera itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.656" offset="13258736">Are typical needs to make restitution, part of the heartland of embezzlement cases, such that the fact that the defendant will be put in prison and have more difficulty making restitution constitutes a ground for departure?</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.153" offset="13308786">The court of appeals in that case correctly, in our view, said obviously not, because in the typical embezzlement case it's fairly clear that you're going to have the need for some restitution, and it's obvious that it would be far more difficult to make restitution if you're in prison, so the question of whether typical restitution needs are within the heartland was resolved as one of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.390" offset="13409723">Let me address that point, because in the ad damnum portion of the Rivera case the court indeed sent that back to the district court and said, if you find the need for restitution in that case particularly unusual, please explain your reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.289" offset="13461341">Then the court of appeals would examine that and give that whatever deference was appropriate because of the superior feel of the district court with respect to the facts of that case that made it unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.415" offset="13497808">The Government is presenting here a sharply discrete and different view of how the Sentencing Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission, the district courts and the appellate courts ought to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.022" offset="13536261">The Sentencing Commission believes that unless it has... because it is the delegee of legislative authority from Congress, unless it has taken factors off the table, it intends the district courts to look at those factors, explain them, and then when they're abused, when there's an abuse of discretion, that can be corrected in a specific case by an appellate court or it can be corrected in gross by the Sentencing Commission, which examines and processes all of those departure decisions and decides whether it's necessary to amend the guidelines, and it does that on a yearly basis by sending changes and amendments to the guidelines to Congress and... if it's necessary to do that.</text>
