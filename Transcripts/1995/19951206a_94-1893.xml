            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="16.903" offset="215106">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.066" offset="231720">The provision of the 1984 cable act that the court of appeals invalidated in this case, section 533(b) of title 47, addresses the special capacity for anticompetitive conduct by local telephone companies in providing cable television programming services.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.998" offset="359406">That capacity stems from the telephone companies' established situation as regulated monopolies, and it is important to an understanding of the premises on which the commission and Congress have acted over the past 25 years not to elide too quickly over what it has meant for these companies to be regulated monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.430" offset="489183">They have in the first place been given exclusive franchises.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.507" offset="513529">The Virginia statutory provision involved in this case is set forth in footnote 17 of the district court's opinion on page 77a of our appendix to the petition, which protected them against competition in providing the telephone services regulated on the basis of recovery of costs and return of capital type of rate regulation still the predominant and historically the only form of rate regulation to which they've been subject in providing telephone service.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.526" offset="685519">They've been granted rights of way sometimes with the exercise of the power of eminent domain to construct poles and conduits and their expenses in doing so have been included as part of their rate base, so at the advent of modern cable television, when it was replacing the old community antenna systems, they had not only the capacity to provide wire service throughout the communities they served, they had the wires in place to virtually every residence and a capacity through their Government-sponsored regulated monopolies to stifle the development of any other competition in the provision of cable television services.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.905" offset="923024">I don't mean to suggest that any of this was in any way improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.349" offset="940892">Obviously, this served an important public interest on the part of the local governments in assuring that telephone service would be available throughout their communities at a reasonable cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.340" offset="1008810">But the situation with which the commission and Congress have been concerned is that not just through their legitimate use of the advantage that they had were they in a position to stifle the development of others in providing these services, but they also would have the capacity incentive to use unfair competitive methods.</text>

            <text syncTime="4082.715" offset="16478316">The time, place, and manner cases in this Court, the model intermediate scrutiny cases often have involved direct restraints on speech, as such Heffron v. Krishna Consciousness, Ward v. Rock Against Racism, Taxpayers for Vincent are all examples of that, and as long as there were other opportunities, as we have shown here, content-neutral regulation for a nonspeech purpose, they met intermediate scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.779" offset="16622616">Now, we're not talking about the remote future when we're talking about video dial tone with the capacity to carry three, four, or five providers and not just the telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.609" offset="16681862">We have already had in place in DeKalb County, Georgia, in Fairfax and Arlington Counties, Virginia, model trial runs of it in which there have been about 200 channels and the phone company was restricted to 50 percent or less as the provider of programming, the others having to be leased out, and a more permanent one is to begin soon in Dover, New Jersey, a small community, where all of the programming will be provided by others than the telephone company because the regulations are not yet in place that will permit the telephone company to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.971" offset="16883318">What is really at stake in many of the contentions being made here is the contention that the phone company should have autonomy over all its lines to be the sole user or to control who can use it, a form of asking for what Solicitor General Fried used to call Lochnerizing the First Amendment--</text>
