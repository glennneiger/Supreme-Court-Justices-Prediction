            <text syncTime="33.225" offset="272811">From the inception of this case, the Colorado Republican Party has asked that this Federal law, section 441a(d)(3), be declared unconstitutional because it needlessly prevents our speech, speech that we are ready, willing, and able to engage in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.802" offset="6067188">I wanted to take a few minutes to just clarify the scheme that's at work here under the campaign act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.897" offset="6095504">Under the act, an expenditure is defined as something that's extended for purposes of influencing an election, and expenditures are considered coordinated expenditures where a political party is concerned, and if they are coordinated expenditures, then they are viewed as contributions, which would then be covered by the contribution limits and the doctrines that this Court has announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.714" offset="6198845">The petitioners have accepted this scheme, and accepted that their expenditures should be viewed as coordinated expenditures, so they've accepted this as a theoretical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.774" offset="6263002">But I would like to point out also that on this record there's evidence of actual coordinated expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.379" offset="6289437">The party chairman in this case admitted that even though there wasn't a Republican candidate at the time, that he was coordinating with all three Republican candidates, and certainly the Federal Election Commission has held for some years--</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.726" offset="6454845">That's correct, and the Federal Election Commission has pointed out that there's nothing in the act that requires that there have been a nominee selected before this principle applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.835" offset="6499253">The statute itself refers to candidates, it does not refer to nominees, and there are parts of the statute where the Congress has used nominee when it intended to make that point.</text>
