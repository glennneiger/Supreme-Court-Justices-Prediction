            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="8.464" offset="114621">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.997" offset="136668">Petitioner Cooper was convicted in that State of first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.878" offset="156208">His bizarre behavior and refusal or inability to communicate with counsel put petitioner’s competence to stand trial at issue both before and during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.408" offset="198317">It is well settled that due process prohibits the trial of an incompetent defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.601" offset="219110">In previous cases, we have defined competence to stand trial as the present ability to understand the charges against you and to assist your attorney in making defense to those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.433" offset="262474">Under Oklahoma law, a criminal defendant who claims to be incompetence to stand trial or whose attorney makes this claim on his behalf is required to demonstrate incompetence by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.043" offset="312838">Clear and convincing evidence is a heightened standard of proof which falls somewhere between preponderance of the evidence which is the normal civil standard and beyond the reasonable doubt the standard for criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.249" offset="357664">The question presented by this case is whether application of Oklahoma’s heightened evidence rule violated petitioner’s federal constitutional right to due process by infringing on his fundamental rights to be tried only while competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.671" offset="415447">The Okalahoma State Court rejected petitioner’s due process claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.513" offset="430807">The State Supreme Court ruled that the risk of criminal defendant’s feigning incompetence combined with the State’s interest in the efficient functioning of its judicial process justify the clear and convincing standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.617" offset="479186">In an opinion filed with Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.946" offset="492456">We conclude that Oklahoma’s clear and convincing evidence rule has no substantial roots in prior practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.770" offset="523803">At common law courts typically required a criminal defendant to prove his incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.119" offset="549194">Even today only three States in addition to Oklahoma plays a burden as high as clear and convincing evidence on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.962" offset="576570">The remaining 46 States as well as the Federal Government pose a lesser burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.750" offset="595692">Moreover we find that the rule is fundamentally unfair in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.715" offset="611574">Oklahoma’s clear and convincing evidence test allows the State to precede the trial, even when the defendant has demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he is incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.144" offset="653266">The consequences of preceding the trial while incompetent are serious for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.882" offset="672283">Other constitutional rights such as the right to a jury trial and the right to testify in one’s own defense can only be adequately exercised by a competent person.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.503" offset="710735">We find that Oklahoma’s interest in the efficient operation of his criminal justice system is insufficient to overcome the defendant’s fundamental right not to be tried while incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.219" offset="749605">The decision of the Court is unanimous.</text>
