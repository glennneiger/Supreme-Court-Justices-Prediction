            <text syncTime="10.022" offset="120387">This case involves the Hours of Service Act Congress first passed in 1907 is designed for railway safety by limiting the number of hours a train crew may remain on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.653" offset="170960">It requires the railroads to provide crew members with a certain number of off duty rest periods of adequate rest and before a new shift can begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.606" offset="206695">As a general rule, a train crew may not work more than 12 consecutive hours and when the limit is reached, the crew must ceased at once and a six number of hours of rest as I have indicated in the designated rest term must be afforded before the new shift can begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.026" offset="260403">If a crew works more than 12 consecutives hours, as specified in the Act the railroad places heavy fines for each member of the crew who works beyond the permitted period.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.327" offset="289660">This means that railroad try to schedule their operations so that a crew can change at a convenient terminal point but sometimes this cannot occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.823" offset="319649">If the 12-hour limit is about to be reached, the railroad must stop the train so that the second crew can replace the first crew then the crew that is to be relieved at the end of the shift is now called the outlawed crew, and transportation of the fresh crew to the train and with the outlawed crew back to the rest point is called deadhead transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.141" offset="392896">This case involves the question of how to classify the time of the outlawed crew spends waiting for the deadhead transportation to arrive.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.764" offset="419332">The petitioners of Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the United Transportation Union claim that the waiting, a time is on-duty time that counts against the 12-hour limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.353" offset="457680">The Railroad and the Federal Railroad Administration which is the agency that administers the Act says that the waiting time is not on-duty time.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.031" offset="488400">They claim it so called limbo time.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.027" offset="496445">This is a third category of time that the Act does recognize although it does not call it by this name.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.094" offset="520687">Limbo time does not count for on-duty time or the crewâ€™s rest time and limbo time is paid time.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.549" offset="546496">We agree with the Railroads and Federal Railroad Administration at the time spent waiting for the deadhead transportation is not on-duty time, it is, in our view, limbo time.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.871" offset="579828">The deadhead transportation for the outlawed crew has that character and we conclude that the time waiting for the deadhead transportation should be characterized the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.954" offset="616086">The time the employees spent in waiting for the deadhead transportation will not contribute to employee fatigue during the work assignment because of the interval rest period that will take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.550" offset="654538">As our reading of the Act is in full accord with that given by the Seventh Circuit in the en banc decision, which we now review, the judgment is affirmed and the opinion for the Court is unanimous.</text>
