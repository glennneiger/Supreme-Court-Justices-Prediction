            <text syncTime="364.010" offset="1592332">We believe that what Congress intended at the time it adopted 794a(a)(2) was to provide a remedy for the new duty it had just imposed on the Federal Government in what is now 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.052" offset="1660564">In 504(a) in 1978, Congress extended the application of 504 to Federal agencies, or in this case executive agencies, and at the same time it amended 505(a)(2), as Justice O'Connor said, to provide remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.461" offset="1722213">We think the explanation of the difference in wording that the Ninth Circuit provided in Doe is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.977" offset="1752201">The amendment to 504 came from the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.160" offset="1764949">The amendment to 505(a)(2) came from the Senate, and the conference report didn't make the two exactly coterminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.195" offset="1801102">But to read this as intending a difference in treatment between the two would mean that Congress imposed a new duty on the Federal Government but then in the remedy section provided no remedy, and at the same time, that Federal provider means somethiNg different--</text>

            <text syncTime="2867.320" offset="11605589">I'd think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.101" offset="11608724">Another thing I think that the Court should focus on about the development of law that was the backdrop behind these statutes, the remedies for damages was not clear until the Franklin Court, the Franklin opinion from this Court in 1992, so even at the time that this 1986 amendment was passed, it was not at all clear that there were damages necessarily available against all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.394" offset="11693883">There were lower courts that had held that, but those cases did not involve Federal executive agencies, because they're not covered by title VI and title IX, so those cases did not address the issue that's before the Court here of Federal sovereign immunity, and that's really a critical distinction between the statutes that often is not addressed in opinions by courts because it just wasn't at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.441" offset="11786043">In fact, I think that that's a significant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.052" offset="11800567">When you look through the history of the different times that when these other provisions were enacted you can see the development of the law did not extend at that time to damages against entities other... in some lower courts have been involved in, but it did not extend to the waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.805" offset="11867545">In fact, one of the lower court's opinions, Miener, that the petitioners cite... recognize this was pre Atascadero... that although there would be implied cause of action for damages against private entities, it could not operate against the State because there hadn't been a waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.089" offset="12148727">And Congress was really trying to say, we're going to treat section 504 for the Federal fund recipients the same way we do title VI and title IX, but it did not, although they tried to adapt that provision to Federal executive agency programs which were never covered under title VI, or title IX, for that matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3026.705" offset="12243186">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.626" offset="12246843">First of all, Your Honor, I think it's important for the Court to construe all of these provisions together and decide whether or not the reading the Government is offering is a plausible one, and whether the structure as a whole that the Government is asking you to adopt is a logical one, because if it is not, the Court should not attribute an illogical, nonplausible intent to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.023" offset="12344436">And the reading that the Government is offering you here is that Congress intended that all recipients of Federal financial assistance be subject to damages, that States be subject to damages... Congress expressly abrogated the States' sovereign immunity for that purpose... that the Federal Government be liable for damages when it comes to employment discrimination on the basis of disability, that the Federal Government be liable in some way when it's a Federal provider, although the Government wants to narrowly contain that, and it has no explanation for why damages wouldn't be available under the plain meaning of a(a)(2) in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.625" offset="12490827">But yet, it urges the Court to conclude that in this one area, direct discrimination by executive agencies, that Congress set out to withhold one kind of relief only, money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.324" offset="12541609">It provided for injunctive relief, it provided for back pay, it provided for attorney's fees, but the Congress set out to withhold one kind of relief, money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.179" offset="12581001">I submit to you that's an implausible reading of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.331" offset="12593644">Well, it... except that it seems to me that it simply poses two opposing canons of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.386" offset="12617886">One is to find the most systematic way of construing the whole statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.080" offset="12636590">Another is to preserve the Government's immunity absent the satisfaction of a very high standard of waiver, and I think what your argument does say, says to us is, all right, which are you going to prefer, systematic logic, or the importance of sovereign immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.543" offset="12726451">I think this Court's cases make clear that, while the waiver of sovereign immunity has to be clear, the Court will not deny damage relief in a case like this, where the reading is an implausible one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.591" offset="12774725">What about Ms. Brinkmann's argument that when Congress did waive immunity in 501, it pregated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.215" offset="12797191">It was not just that we waive immunity, but they--</text>

            <text syncTime="3168.678" offset="12810983">I think that... I think the 501 provision actually supports us, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.540" offset="12830523">That was an entirely different section that was not construed to provide a private cause of action until 1978, unlike 504, and in 1978 Congress set out two different kinds of remedies, title VII for the 501 section, and title VI for the 504 section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.783" offset="12899486">Damages are available under title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.272" offset="12909413">They are not available under title VII, and as a consequence, Congress has to amend the statute in 1991, to make damages available for the first time and thereby equalize the remedies against the Federal Government when it discriminates on the basis of disability, so I think the 501 circumstance helps our view that Congress surely did not intend to carve out this one area and withhold relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.199" offset="13009096">Let me speak to the public entity point for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.000" offset="13020276">I understand the Government's argument to be that the Federal Government is not a public entity within the meaning of 2000d-7(2) because the only statutes being--</text>
