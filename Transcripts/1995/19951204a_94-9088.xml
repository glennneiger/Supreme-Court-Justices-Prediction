            <text syncTime="23.447" offset="233178">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.558" offset="241642">In 1984, after 10 years of careful study, Congress responded to growing criticism of Federal criminal justice systems by creating the United States Sentencing Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.175" offset="280094">The task of the commission was to eliminate unpredictable, unequal, and unfair sentences which had marred Federal criminal law for decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.629" offset="309874">To achieve this goal, the commission was vested with broad factfinding resources, staffed with jurists and leading experts in the sentencing field, and structured to interact symbiotically with the courts and other branches of Government so as to evolve predictable and proportionate sentencing practices throughout the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.720" offset="378315">This case offers this Court an opportunity to define the role of the commission in such a way as to fulfill the express intentions of the Congress which created it.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.314" offset="412692">Meirl Neal was convicted of trafficking in LSD in 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.570" offset="433694">Section 841(b) of title 21 requires a mandatory 10-year penalty for trafficking in 10 or more grams of a mixture of LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.214" offset="464205">At the time Mr. Neal was sentenced, neither the sentencing guideline nor the code contained a definition of the term, mixture.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.080" offset="491686">In this case, and under the rule later announced by this Court in Chapman v. United States, the relevant mixture was held to consist of the blotter paper onto which the LSD was placed for purposes of sale and distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.636" offset="533900">Under this definition, Mr. Neal received a sentence of 16 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.889" offset="550932">Four years after Mr. Neal was sentenced, the Sentencing Commission conducted hearings on whether the sentencing practice used in his case could be reconciled with section 841.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.784" offset="590533">The hearing was required under the commission's 1984 enabling legislation which chartered it and made numerous reference to its absolute and abiding duty to eliminate unwarranted sentencing disparities in Federal criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.904" offset="642987">Congress equipped the commission with numerous tools to achieve this result.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.412" offset="3757097">What they do is, they go to experts, particularly DEA, and they say to DEA, what should we do here to get our intent, so there was at some point some representation from DEA to Congress that would have told them how technically to write a statute that's going to achieve a particular objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.563" offset="3829613">But the particular objective was to put big guys and big deal gangs in jail for 5 years or 10 years, 5 years medium, and less than 5 years, itty-bitty, all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.961" offset="3883216">Now, what is the definition of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="938.575" offset="3893665">Did Congress have in mind that a fairly big-sized expert, or drug guy, or LSD guy was a person with 125 doses, or a person that was trying to sell 2,500?</text>
            <text syncTime="950.741" offset="3942357">Now, that's a huge difference, and somebody on the staff there would have found out from DEA and there would have been pamphlets, and there would have been writings about whether the dangerous people were 125-dose people, or 2,500-dose people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.822" offset="7198677">Now, within the confines of its authority, we believe that the guideline is valid, but the commission does not have the authority to determine or to redetermine, because it would require a reexamination of this Court's decision in Chapman, when those statutes are triggered, and Congress did not delegate to the commission the authority to determine when the mandatory minimum sentencing statute applies.</text>
