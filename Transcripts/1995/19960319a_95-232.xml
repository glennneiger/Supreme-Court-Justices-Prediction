            <text syncTime="15.664" offset="206990">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, good morning, members of the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.896" offset="219947">The Court has granted review in this case on two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.389" offset="233949">First, does the 120-day service requirement of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure supersede the forthwith service requirement of the Suits in Admiralty Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="31.806" offset="271565">Number 2, if not, does the district court have authority to extend the time for service provided under the Suits in Admiralty Act under appropriate circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="41.161" offset="308972">Petitioner Henderson submits to the Court that the answers to both questions are in the affirmative, and would request this Court to reverse the judgments of the lower courts and remand this case for trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.019" offset="356411">First, the 120-day requirement in Rule 4 supersedes the forthwith service requirement of the Suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.515" offset="386399">There are three basic reasons for this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.037" offset="396535">Number 1, the forthwith service requirement is procedural, so it was invalidated by the Rules Enabling Act when Rule 4 was amended in 1966 and 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.925" offset="444078">Second, a holding that the forthwith requirement prevails would violate and frustrate congressional intent and the policies underlying the act and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.000" offset="488381">Finally, even if the forthwith service requirement is not procedural, the 1982 amendments to the Federal rules were done by direct legislative action, so they would invalidate the forthwith requirement.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="97.539" offset="534461">Well, the Rule 4(j) as I read it, Mr. Sheehy, simply says that if a complaint is not... if service is not made on a defendant within 120 days it shall be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.458" offset="586184">It doesn't say you invariably have 120 days in which to serve a complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.666" offset="815017">There was a suggestion by this Court about service by mail, which eventually was changed, and there was also no submission by this Court of a good cause extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.011" offset="856394">What happened is, Congress, upon suggestions by lawyers, particularly in California, concerned about the certified mail provision and also about the fact that there was an absolute 120-day shall-be-dismissed provision, and the... there were suggestions made that were discussed by Professor Siegel--</text>

            <text syncTime="199.567" offset="942599">--Well, my point exactly is that the rule itself says, and I think the Government has conceded in its brief on page 20 that there's a clear implication that a party has 120 days to serve under Rule 4, that there are no exceptions for it, it's not a guideline, it's not a suggestion, but a party has 120 days, and I think--</text>

            <text syncTime="218.961" offset="1020234">Well, but there certainly is room for another statute, which we have here in the Suits in Admiralty Act, to have a different requirement, and you can read both statutes and give effect to both, that for a suit in admiralty it has to be served forthwith, and if it's not a suit under that act, then you might have a longer time.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.646" offset="1106961">I mean, that is the argument the Government makes, and it certainly is one that is plausible, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="257.291" offset="1173521">So in effect, we have one statute that says the Government can be sued in 50 days in admiralty, the Government in all cases can be sued in 120 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.932" offset="1680088">And my point in the enactment of Rule 4 and the history of Rule 4, especially in the 1982 amendments, is that because the marshalls were being taken out of the process and prior to 1982 it was more or less a due diligence standard under Rule 4, governed, of course, by the parameters of the statute of limitations and also motions to dismiss for want of prosecution, this issue really did not arise very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.488" offset="1778308">In 1982, when the marshalls were taken out of the process to a large extent, there was then a suggestion that we have a time limit in order to make sure that there was not undue delay, and I think that it is clear in the discussions in the various committees that there was a search for a bright line test and also a search for a time that would take the discretion out of the hands of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.176" offset="1877051">And, in fact, there was a discussion and a comment by a Member of Congress, and it's cited in the brief, having to do with the fact that we want to avoid extended and protracted litigation over the ambiguity of the time frames of Rule 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.905" offset="2431996">First, Galveston is the port city for Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.258" offset="2445371">The Galveston court generally handles, and are very experienced in admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.644" offset="2466896">The particular Federal judge there, Judge Kent, was a lawyer who practiced admiralty in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.638" offset="2486853">I don't think there is any prohibition between filing it in Galveston versus filing it in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.022" offset="2504408">They are both part of the Southern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.524" offset="2510468">But certainly, with all respect to the judges in the Houston Division, Judge Kent is extremely familiar with admiralty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.989" offset="2536277">Secondly... I hesitate to raise this in light of the issue that we're here on, but also the docket is much quicker in Galveston than it is in Houston, in large part because of the criminal docket in Houston, in the Federal courts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.985" offset="2580267">Thirdly, the operator of the vessel was Lykes Brothers, and they are located or have an office in Galveston.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.339" offset="2605658">And again, I did not make the decision, but those are explanations as to why, and I think rational reasons why, the case was filed in the Galveston Division rather than the Houston Division, although I think as a matter of law it really doesn't matter much, because they are both part of the Southern District of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.252" offset="2905335">And in that case this Court held that, in fact, the procedures and policies underlying Rule 23 were such that the Court did have the authority to toll the statute under Rule 23, the class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.301" offset="2949534">That is, that class, people who would be members of the putative class, would have the right to sue dating back to the filing of the original class certification action.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.098" offset="2988718">So in that particular case, the Court held that Rule 23 allowed that tolling even though the petitioner had argued in that case that it should not because the remedy and the statute of limitations were contained within the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.539" offset="3046501">In addition, not exactly directly on point to Your Honor's question, but in the Sibbach case there was a question about Rule 35 having to do with physical examinations, and there was an argument in that case that the rule dealing with physical examinations was not permissible because, in fact, it was such a fundamental matter... that is, the examination of the body... and the Court held that in fact it was a proper rule under the Rule Enabling Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.461" offset="3566233">The reasons, I suspect, this has not come up is because the Rule Enabling Act is clear in this area, that if there is a conflict between a prior procedural statute and a rule, the rule is going to prevail and, in this particular case, it is our position that the forthwith requirement is clearly procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.434" offset="3642092">It has to do with the way that a party is brought into litigation, and I am not aware of any situation where a method or timing of service could be considered anything other than procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.302" offset="3681590">Once we get to that conclusion, that is, that the rule is procedural, and we get to the conclusion that there is a conflict, which I believe is clearly supported by the legislative history and the committee reports underlying the 1982 amendments to the Federal rules, then it is our position that the Rule Enabling Act in effect gives the priority to Rule 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.338" offset="13217746">Two quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.489" offset="13222344">Number 1, the concession by the Government that the certified versus registered mail analysis that in effect it does not matter in this procedure is also important to another argument that the Government made both in its brief and at the beginning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.048" offset="13272499">One of the arguments by the courts that have discussed this issue is the location of the forthwith requirement being in section 2 of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.463" offset="13302174">The argument is, is that procedure is in section 3, substance is in section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.027" offset="13320460">The concession that the certified mail and registered mail is, in fact, procedural, falls into section 2 and therefore casts great doubt on the argument that there should be a distinction based on the location of the forthwith requirement in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.996" offset="13376362">Number 2, the point that Justice Souter was talking about, namely, a reason why the Government should be treated differently in admiralty, something about locating sailors, et cetera, three quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.714" offset="13415232">Number 1, no reason to treat the Government differently than private parties in that context, because all parties have that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.979" offset="13440310">Number 2, there is no reason to treat the Government differently in admiralty cases versus any other cases that the Government may be involved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.993" offset="13468313">And Number 3, recall that there's a statute of limitations of 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.426" offset="13482105">If there's going to be problems with somehow locating witnesses, and that's the reason why we have a forthwith requirement, the statute of limitations of 2 years is going to cause a problem far beyond any service requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.613" offset="13526827">For the reasons we have stated in the brief and in the argument, we would request that the Court reverse the judgments of the courts below.</text>
