            <label>Mr. Henry P. Monaghan</label>
            <text syncTime="10.556" offset="183564">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.474" offset="195162">On April 24 the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act became legally operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.728" offset="220240">This act made several modifications in the habeas corpus practice of the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.531" offset="243437">The provisions of pertinence here are contained in section 106(b), which governs second and successive petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.571" offset="275619">These provisions are set out at pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.541" offset="299443">Section 106(b) has three subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.843" offset="316684">The first two, (b)(1) and (b)(2), provide substantive standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.147" offset="333925">(b)(1) applies to claims previously adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="346672">(b)(2) applies to new claims both of law and of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.218" offset="362137">The last section, (b)(3), governs the procedures on second and successive petitions, and it clearly alters the prior practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.590" offset="399649">Essentially it requires that, before the district court can entertain a petition, a second petition, the petitioner must obtain an authorization order from an appropriate panel of judges in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.916" offset="452939">Subsection (C), to which we will have more reference, provides... and that is set out on page 3... the court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the applicant satisfies the relevant substantive criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.478" offset="535172">Subsection... finally, we turn to section 103(E), which is at the bottom of page 3, and that provides the grant or denial of any authorization by the court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.593" offset="623675">On May 1, a petition was filed in this Court styled a writ of habeas... on May 2, a petition was filed in this Court styled as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus for appellate or certiorari review, and among other things the petition invoked this Court's jurisdiction under 2241(a), the so-called original habeas jurisdiction of this Court, which from time out of mind has existed as an appellate remedy.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="151.612" offset="747704">Has what, Mr. Monaghan?</text>

          <turn speaker="henry_p_monaghan" startTime="153.480" stopTime="352.424">
            <label>Mr. Henry P. Monaghan</label>
            <text syncTime="153.480" offset="755228">From time out of mind has existed as an appellate remedy, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.766" offset="768393">It couldn't exist as an original writ because of Marbury v. Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.568" offset="787619">It would be an attempt to expand the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.038" offset="801412">On May 3, this court granted a stay of execution, granted a petition for certiorari, and ordered briefing limited to three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.109" offset="833699">I will, of course, address the questions that the Court posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.096" offset="849686">To the extent that time permits and the Court feels it helpful, I would be prepared to offer our preliminary views as to the standards that should be applied if the Court concludes, as we hope it will and believe that it should, that section 106 of the new legislation does not impair this Court's jurisdiction under 2241(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="197.491" offset="931293">The three questions framed by this Court ask whether, when Mr. Felker's attorneys presented their petition to the Clerk of the Court, he was obliged, by virtue of the new legislation, particularly section 106(3)(E), to reject it for want of jurisdiction, and second, if he was, whether section 106 is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.423" offset="1023035">Until we receive Georgia's reply brief, we believed that both parties and the Solicitor General, who represents the views of the United States, agreed upon the appropriate response.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.564" offset="1067548">While the petition for a writ of certiorari must be dismissed, section 106(3)(E) did not restrict this Court's jurisdiction under 2241(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="241.419" offset="1106940">With the sole exception of Senator Hatch, the amici took the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.340" offset="1130659">Perhaps I am mistaken, but in its reply brief, Georgia now seems to have moved from a position that sparing review under section 2241(a) is permitted, and to a position in which it now seems to argue no review at all is possible under 2241(a), that this was the congressional intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.254" offset="1210281">To the extent that Georgia does so in its reply brief, it does so without addressing any of the arguments that we advanced in our initial brief based upon plain meaning, nor does it discuss the relevance of this Court's citations going back at least to Martin v. Hunter's Lessee and Cohens v. Virginia, which postulate the need for uniformity in the administration of Federal law, and in Cohens a reluctance to interpret congressional statutes to foreclose appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.821" offset="1324592">Nor does it even refer to McCardle and Yerger, despite our heavy reliance upon those cases for the proposition that the rule laid down in Cohens v. Virginia, which is that you do not construe congressional legislation to impair your jurisdiction unless it's clear it has a special stringent effect when claims involving constitutional right involving the deprivation of liberty are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.091" offset="1437650">The Georgia reply brief does make one substantive argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.344" offset="1466699">It asserts that it would be unfair if habeas were available, since the warden would have no opportunity to get review of a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.950" offset="1497105">On its face, this is a very curious argument, because habeas corpus has always been asymmetrical in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.687" offset="1524063">No one has ever thought it was unfair to the State that the writ might be available to the prisoner on appropriate circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.424" offset="1551022">Well, but if it is, indeed, an appellate... if the original writ of habeas corpus, as you say, is appellate in this case, then it does seem that the prisoner could obtain relief, but certainly it does not seem, under cases like Yerger, that the warden could.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.536" offset="1615492">That's exactly right, Your Honor, but I think that that... I think first of all, two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.254" offset="1630330">I think that asymmetry is built into the nature of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.789" offset="1644436">The prisoner always can sue for the writ, but the warden can't bring a declaratory judgment suit against the prisoner.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.860" offset="1668782">Well, but in an appellate situation, supposing the district court grants a writ of habeas corpus, the State or the Government can appeal from the grant.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.835" offset="1708592">Well, the... let me put it... maybe a different response.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.274" offset="1750388">The warden will always get review.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.072" offset="1733566">What they're trying to introduce is a new asymmetry into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.309" offset="1758539">If the writ is granted by the court, it will go down to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.611" offset="1779750">However it rules, the case will come back up to the court of appeals and go on cert to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.967" offset="1809216">The court of appeals is supposed to engage in a gatekeeping function here, but one of the points we want to make is that the court of appeals decided the merits of this case, and that's a point which I'm going to address, which is the... and it decided it in an egregious manner, if you actually study what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.244" offset="1878284">But it did not perform a gatekeeping function here, but that's a... that goes to a somewhat different point.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.332" offset="1906601">Certainly, if you're correct in your position and the Solicitor General that certiorari doesn't lie here, there's no way of directly reviewing that, is there?</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="453.590" offset="1955606">But I take it your theory of... that sort of neutralizes the warden's complaint is not merely that there is an asymmetry in the very structure of habeas practice, but that the result of the probable cause determination when it goes against the warden ultimately is merged in what happens in the district court, and it's like many preliminary orders that are merged before any ultimate review takes place.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.457" offset="2063126">That's... yes, Your Honor, and if there is an asymmetry, if there were, it would hardly strike me as a point of great substance, given the tradition of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.033" offset="2113386">Now, Senator Hatch's brief devotes a scant two pages, pages that are tacked on at the very end of his brief, to the argument that section 106 bars original habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.889" offset="2156854">Like Georgia's reply brief, he addresses none of the arguments we make or the authorities we invoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.209" offset="2178170">Senator Hatch's brief is, however, very interesting for what it does not state.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.780" offset="2196455">Despite the brief's copious references to the number and comprehensive character of the Senate and House debates, Senator Hatch cites not a single sentence of legislative history that indicates that Congress gave the slightest thought to this Court's original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.556" offset="2259567">Senator Hatch's brief constitutes a form of postenactment legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.360" offset="2282764">It suggests, though, does it not, that it was... Mr. Monaghan, that it was omitted inadvertently, because what does come across from that brief was the intention to foreclose any review if the appellate panel refused to certify.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.142" offset="2373879">Well, if the argument is that it was inadvertently omitted, I might say that this Court is not authorized to write legislation that Congress might have written but didn't write.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.902" offset="2436886">If it was inadvertently omitted, then Congress will presumably get a chance to do it, but it's not the function of this Court to rewrite the statute, and I think adherence to that principle is especially important, because it would curtail the historic jurisdiction of this Court, a curtailment that, as we have suggested, would raise some constitutional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.546" offset="2511492">Finally, we have no idea whether Congress would or would not have enacted legislation that in terms directly sought to impair the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, so--</text>

Mayo, in which effectively habeas corpus relief was given under section 1651, but there is a body of case law in your Court, last invoked in an opinion by Justice Scalia last year, or early this year, which says that section 106 is inoperative if there's a specific provision that deals with the proposed remedy, and so that brings you back to 2241(a), and for that reason I was unwilling to brief that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.569" offset="7071531">In various decisions of this Court in the area of Federal habeas corpus for State prisoners, concern has been expressed on the previous statutory parameters governing the well recognized problem of successive habeas corpus litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.627" offset="7123776">Now, Congress has acted, we submit, within its authority to regulate the consideration of successive petitions while we contend not impermissibly interfering with this Court's jurisdiction or having the effect of suspending the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.137" offset="7181872">While it might appear at first, from a review of the briefs, that the parties are not very far apart on their views as to the statute, there's one thing that the respondent in this case wishes to make adamantly clear, and that is that we are very far apart on the essential issue underlying the resolution by this court of the three issues that it has posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.216" offset="7266196">First, the respondent opposes any interpretation of the act and its impact on 2241 which would engender further delay, whereas the petitioner--</text>

            <text syncTime="1965.235" offset="8002222">We're asking that the Court use the backdrop of its rules and its jurisprudence to find it has no applicability in the context of successive habeas corpus petitions, and the reason that we're saying that is because, if this Court has the right to guarantee a direct access of the petitioner to this Court, then essentially this Court becomes a lower court who is doing nothing but relitigating what Congress has delegated to the lower court as being their task.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.720" offset="8212142">So under Yerger, the basic writ was preserved, and it was described and explained as an exercise of appellate jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.751" offset="8312348">It's... they're saying that it's exercising appellate jurisdiction, but what the lower court... you would be actually acting as a factfinder determining the prima facie case, because our position is that this Court would be bound by the substantive provisions of the act, so in that sense this Court would become a factfinder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.332" offset="8702617">Congress has tried to delegate that factfinding screening process, as the petitioner said, to the lower courts, so we're asking the Court to reserve the direct writ, as we choose to call it, for those rare and extraordinary circumstances where there is not another avenue of relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.831" offset="13464635">That's at point 4 and 5a of the appendix to our brief, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.569" offset="13491593">What Congress did there is amend the jurisdiction of Federal circuit judges to grant original habeas, and basically said that that was no longer possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.792" offset="13540494">It seems to us that Congress knows how to address original habeas jurisdiction when it wants to, and it concluded that it did not wish to do so insofar as the Supreme Court was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.950" offset="13585112">And to us, this makes great sense, because after all Congress was legislating against a backdrop of this Court's decisions and its policies, and there are two things to note about those particular decisions and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.444" offset="13639028">One is that for over 70 years this Court has attempted to impose reasonable restrictions over the abuse of the writ, particularly second or successive petitions, and secondly, in dealing with original habeas petitions this Court has, as several of you on the bench, Mr. Chief Justice and others, have pointed out, this Court has imposed very stringent requirements before granting original habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.992" offset="13741219">There hasn't been one granted since Ex parte Grossman in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.063" offset="13757520">Not only that, the statute 2241(b) that Mr. Justice Stevens just mentioned, 2242, which requires that there be some showing of why the applicant hadn't gone to another court, and 2254(b), the old 2254(b), essentially indicated that no petition would be granted unless it could be shown that relief was not available any place else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.202" offset="13906104">That is, the applicant can go to the Court, having met those requirements, if that applicant has gone through the gatekeeper process, but that does not dictate that the Court should actually entertain and grant an original writ under those circumstances.</text>
