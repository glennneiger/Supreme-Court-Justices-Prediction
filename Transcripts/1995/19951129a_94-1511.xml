            <text syncTime="13.974" offset="196731">This is an inmate access to the court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.176" offset="209583">The State of Arizona meets and exceeds the requirements of Bounds v. Smith by providing at the time of trial 26 law libraries at nine separate prison complexes across the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.131" offset="249393">As the prison population has grown from more than 15,000 to 22,000 prisoners, we have added seven more libraries, for a total of 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.303" offset="282099">In addition to providing adequate legal resources to the inmates through these law libraries, Arizona goes above and beyond the requirements of Bounds by facilitating the use of legal clerks and legal assistants to obtain books and to help in the preparation of lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.247" offset="341867">Also, we encourage inmates to take our classes to teach them to read English, and we find interpreters for non-English-speaking inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.753" offset="375931">We facilitate also assistance from family, from friends, outside lawyers and paralegals and other prisoner rights groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.572" offset="403202">Although deference to State officials in the area of prison administration is required by this Court, the district court in this case has imposed an order which micromanages virtually every aspect of prison life in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.666" offset="463597">Additionally, the district court has entered its order despite a record that has not established an injury warranting systemic relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.736" offset="495780">The result is that the order is overbroad, overreaching, and far beyond the requirements of Bounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.469" offset="606749">The record in this case is difficult, and it's difficult for a variety of reasons, but one reason is because it's difficult to separate pure findings of fact from the judge's order, from how he has extrapolated that based upon, we believe, his misinterpretation of what Bounds requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.098" offset="6141260">The other one you've touched upon a couple of times by reference to Turner, and that is, how do we measure sort of what, kind of the reasonable level of required service may be, or required opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.607" offset="6199356">I think I'm correct that you argued on the basis of Turner in at least your reply brief in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.563" offset="6235091">Did you go to the district court at any time and say, look, we not only have to apply Bounds here, we have to apply Bounds in the light of Turner, which sort of looks, as it were, to both sides of the equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.073" offset="6297158">Did you make that argument to the district court that it wasn't applying Turner and should have?</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.296" offset="6546053">First, I think the basic finding here was that the vast majority of adult prisoners have no adequate means to research and present their papers in court, and that was made up specific findings and a number of elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.056" offset="6601119">How the lockdown system... the system as to how the great majority of prisoners actually got the books from the library, inability to use them, how the staffing worked in the system, how the law clerks, who, by the way, have no role in research, worked, how the supposed one source of legal assistance worked, that is the prisoner legal assistance, and what the sources for illiterate and Spanish-speaking prisoners were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.457" offset="6706758">I want to point out also that in the defendants' reply brief they said that they were not challenging any of the findings of the district court as clearly erroneous, and I want to further point out that a number of the findings, and these actually from the district court, if one goes back, both parties submitted findings, a number of the findings actually came from defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.169" offset="6781573">I want to further say that I do not believe that the order... that the record supports a claim that the State asked for some different form of developing the remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.730" offset="13535793">That, I think, is crystal clear, that first Turner wasn't applied, and if it is applied, that there is a legitimate penalogical interest in saying that you can't have an unlimited amount of books in a cell, that you can't have them for an unlimited amount of time, and that our system, where... which was place at this time, and Exhibit 85 shows that legal assistance would go and help these people if they were illiterate or if they just wanted any book, that that is a reasonable system, and Turner has to be applied to lockdown, and that lockdown situation isn't just in Arizona, it's in every prison, and in fact ours is better than the Bureau of Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.737" offset="13679780">I think the whole point here... I'd like to conclude and ask the Court to consider what Arizona has done and what most States has done is, we've met your precedent.</text>
