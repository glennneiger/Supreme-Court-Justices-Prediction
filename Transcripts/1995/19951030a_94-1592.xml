            <text syncTime="35.916" offset="284253">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.761" offset="319675">The obvious question for you to ask me this morning is, if Congress intended for waiting time for deadhead transportation to be time on duty, why didn't it say so specifically?</text>
            <text syncTime="59.682" offset="379339">Well, the answer to that, at least in my mind, is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.235" offset="393549">We're dealing with a statute that first of all encompasses many train operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.431" offset="426359">Even the petitioners acknowledge that there are thousands of train operations daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.806" offset="451855">At the time of the '69 statute, there were 36,000 train operations each day, so--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="84.571" offset="478917">What do you mean when you say train operations?</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_m_mann" startTime="87.363" stopTime="193.206">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="87.363" offset="490098">--Meaning, a crew goes on duty and performs service for the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.488" offset="518624">That would be one train operation, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.440" offset="530431">And the other answer to that is, and I think it's the real guts of the case is, there was no need to specifically state that waiting time was time on duty because Congress treated that issue in several sections of the statute, and I refer the Court to section 21103(b), and I will talk about (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.085" offset="676926">And in each one of those subsections it's very clear that Congress was attempting... and I submit to you they did close the loopholes, and one basic problem is that railroad workers at that period of time were sitting on trains for hours on end waiting for a pickup crew or another train to come along and take them to their final release period, and it's... throughout the entire amendments the sole purpose was to close those loopholes, and they did it in several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.543" offset="846826">First of all, you don't have to be working at all to be covered as time on duty under the act, because it's very clear... you know, I'm just a country boy, Your Honors, but English is English.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.331" offset="7714000">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.825" offset="7743884">In the view of the Federal respondents, time spent waiting for the arrival of a deadhead vehicle at the conclusion of an employee's duty assignment is neither on nor off-duty time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.900" offset="7780246">That construction is consistent with the text of the pertinent statutory provision, and with the policies underlying the Hours of Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.495" offset="7806578">As Justice Breyer was saying in one of his questions, if a person is asked, how much time did it take you to travel from Washington and Boston, the question is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.333" offset="7845971">If the import of the question is, how big a chunk out of your day did the process of travel take, a person would normally answer it in a way that included associated waiting time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.472" offset="7890483">If the person were known to find air travel particularly uncomfortable or unpleasant, the person might naturally infer that the point of the question was, how much time were you placed in this uncomfortable position, and might answer it in a way that included only the time actually in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.294" offset="7957775">So to see whether waiting time should be counted as part of time spent in deadhead transportation, I think the inquiry should focus on, why did Congress define this as limbo time in the first place, and do the same concerns that caused Congress to define a category of limbo time apply with equal force to the waiting time at issue here, and for all purposes relevant to the Hours of Service Act, the time spent waiting for the deadhead vehicle is functionally indistinguishable from time actually riding in that vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.757" offset="8351701">The reason that time spent in deadhead transportation is limbo time is that it shares some of the characteristics of both on and off-duty time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.300" offset="8525781">The original bill, the bill as originally introduced provided that time deadheading either to or from a duty assignment would be considered on-duty time, and this appears to reflect a... to define the deadheading from a duty assignment as limbo time appears to reflect a compromise that allayed the concerns of the railroads while ensuring that this would not be treated as off-duty time, thereby depriving the employee of an adequate opportunity for rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.838" offset="8636018">So because the employee is not free to come and go as he pleases, and is unlikely to have a meaningful opportunity for rest, it would be inappropriate to consider this off-duty time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.806" offset="8683874">On the other hand, so long as the employee has no duties to perform, his fatigue can pose no danger to himself and others, or others, and therefore it would be inappropriate to treat this as on-duty time, and I think it's instructive to contrast this with the interim periods available for rest that Mr. Mann referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.280" offset="8761719">That is, the reason that the interim periods are defined as on-duty time is not that the employee poses a danger during those periods himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.516" offset="8798708">That clearly wouldn't be the case if the employee is performing no services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.239" offset="8813546">Rather, the reason is that if these periods are not provided at a place where an employee actually has an adequate opportunity for rest, the employee is likely to be tireder at the end of that period than at the beginning, and therefore they need to be counted as on-duty time in order to ensure that he's not performing safety-sensitive tasks more than 12 hours after he initially reported for duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.606" offset="8951055">This is generally a subject of collective bargaining, and Mr. Johnson may have a more precise answer than I do, so that what is a designated terminal insofar as a particular employee is concerned is defined not by the act, but by the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2675.261" offset="10841693">The possibility would always exist that a supervisor would give an instruction to the employee to do a particular thing, so whenever the employee is in this waiting period, there always exists the possibility of being recalled to duty whatever the instructions he was given at the outset of that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.145" offset="10913164">The only other point I'd like to make is that I think our reading of the statute is buttressed by the other point at which time spent in deadhead transportation is used in the same section of the Hours of Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.774" offset="10975753">That is, the act provides that time spent in deadhead transportation to a duty assignment is considered time on duty, and I feel quite certain that the union would state that time spent in deadhead transportation to a duty assignment includes any waiting period between the time that the employee reports and the time that the deadhead vehicle is actually ready to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.988" offset="11060599">That's buttressed by the structure of the statute and by the legislative history, which the Senate report states that time spent in deadhead transportation to a duty assignment is to be calculated from the time an employee reports for duty, so this gives further confirmation of the fact that the waiting period is properly included within the phrase, time spent in deadhead transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.832" offset="11195913">Before the Ninth Circuit ruling, there was... the statutory scheme was administered in a very straightforward, simple manner, predictable and certainty for the railroad in how to schedule crews and operate their trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.950" offset="11252442">The very simple rule that the Hours of Service Act provided was that you could operate the crew up to 12 hours, but if you realized, if you saw that the train was not going to make its intended terminal, all you had to do to avoid a violation of the act was notify the crew to identify a place where they could pull over, park the train, and then they were relieved from all other duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.446" offset="11338437">At that point, all they had to do was wait for transportation to arrive, which typically also brought the relief crew as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.851" offset="11368008">The relief crew got on the train, took the train on to its terminal, then the expired or outlawed crew would be transported to its place of final release.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.254" offset="11489634">Now, one thing I'd like to point out here is a difference between us and the unions, one among many differences, is that they try and argue that under the statute the crew is on duty until it reaches its place of final release, which is the terminal that it didn't make, but that's not the way the statute works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.038" offset="11576779">The language is quite clear that on duty runs from the time you report for duty until you're finally released from duty, and you're finally released from duty under the statute when the railroad dispatcher advises the crew you're relieved from duty, don't do anything else.</text>

I mean, typically there's a train... they try and schedule it so the train is there ready for them to get on board and go on, but if the train hasn't come in yet, that time period they're waiting to assume duty and that's counted as on-duty time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.090" offset="11880948">But to come back to the point I was going to make about the pay, all that happens at the place of final release, they don't have any more duties because they've been relieved from duty on the train, they have no duties while they're waiting for deadhead transportation, they have no duties while they're in the taxicab or the van, or another train, perhaps, but they're being paid, and when they get to the place of final release, all that is, is they clock out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.848" offset="11972064">That's all final release means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.240" offset="11977602">When they get to their terminal, they clock out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.614" offset="11987110">That stops the pay, and it starts their rest period, because the railroad has to know when the rest period begins so they can be called again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.868" offset="12080106">But even if there were abuses here, the abuses were whatever they were related to deadhead transportation, and they've all been addressed by the fact that waiting for deadhead transportation and the deadhead transportation itself is not counted towards the rest period, and therefore, when they get to the end, when they get to the place of final release, they get their full rest period.</text>
