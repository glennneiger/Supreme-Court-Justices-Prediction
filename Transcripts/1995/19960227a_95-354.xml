            <text syncTime="30.601" offset="262222">Two weeks before the termination decision was announced to him, and arguably on the day that it was made, his boss came to his office and he said, O'Connor, you are too damn old for this kind of work.</text>

            <text syncTime="64.382" offset="397327">He had a better record than his replacement, who had a slightly below average performance evaluation for the preceding year, and who throughout their career had ranked lower in the company salary class classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.039" offset="4791959">The lower courts ruled in this case that any older employee who is replaced by someone who is 40 years old cannot rely on the McDonnell Douglas framework to make out a case of age discrimination, even if the inference of discrimination in the case might be strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.727" offset="4846711">That rule makes McDonnell Douglas useless in a large number of age discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.961" offset="4863639">And it particularly hobbles experienced employees who are at the upper end of the age group who are the most likely to be the targets of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.936" offset="4899583">And it has that effect, ironically, because Congress gave the act a broad remedial reach and it extended the protections of the act to include those who were 40 years old.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.252" offset="5068857">But the rationale for the McDonnell Douglas framework was that direct evidence of discrimination is going to be very rare, and the purpose of the framework was to allow an employee, or the EEOC, I may add, to use McDonnell Douglas to prove the ultimate issue in the case, which is: Was there discrimination or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.957" offset="5147642">And what McDonnell Douglas recognized is that in most disparate treatment cases the evidence on the issue of the ultimate question of discrimination is going to be pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.022" offset="5187871">That's the... the burden of proof on pretext merges with the burden of proof on the ultimate issue of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.108" offset="5216292">Now, the age of the replacement employee is relevant to the ultimate issue of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.411" offset="7061477">The respondent respectfully urges the Court to affirm the decision of the Fourth Circuit, which was based on a proper evaluation of the particular facts and circumstances in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.750" offset="7110796">The Fourth Circuit's test for a termination replacement fact scenario is particularly important for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.166" offset="7144442">Number 1, it's an objective test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.317" offset="7157085">It measures whether or not a mere difference in age implicates the act's prohibitions, the age act prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.832" offset="7191149">Number 2, the protected nonprotected distinction incorporates title VII principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.387" offset="7221346">It is not a new concept to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.091" offset="7232213">Number 3, it accommodates the reality of life that in most situations a younger person is almost always going to be replacing someone older.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.969" offset="7279652">That age difference might be a year, it might be half a year, it might be 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.361" offset="7297206">That's a reality of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.813" offset="7303057">That doesn't come out of a court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.304" offset="7312984">That's just life, and it doesn't go away because Congress passed an age statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.866" offset="7331270">It comes into focus in this case because we can't change that fact, and courts should deal with that fact where the issue of discrimination is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.594" offset="7374215">What you end up with in any other test is merely an age difference, where they're simply pointing to the plaintiff's age, whatever that might be, and the replacement's age, whatever that might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.842" offset="7435133">That's only a difference of numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.065" offset="7444119">A difference in numbers is never sufficient standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.848" offset="7463240">There has to be more.</text>
