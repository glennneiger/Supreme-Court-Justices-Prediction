            <text syncTime="1719.198" offset="7021302">This case is about the obligation of Federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on them by Congress, both courts of appeals and district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.110" offset="7056933">I'd like to address the holdings of the court of appeals in turn, first that the district court's remanding of this case on both the grounds was an appealable order under section 1291, and second that the Burford doctrine afforded the district court no discretion to enter that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.241" offset="7113462">With respect to appealability, the issue is whether there is an exception under section 1291 for reviewable remand orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.436" offset="7146167">That is, remand orders that do not fall within the bar of section 1447(d) and therefore are reviewable either by a mandamus or appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.202" offset="7181276">The Court held in the Cohill case that district courts have authority to remand cases even when Congress has not expressly authorized remand on a particular ground if the court would otherwise have authority to dismiss that case in order to allow proceedings to go forward in the State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2294.642" offset="9323003">The two principal areas in which I'm aware from reviewing the courts of appeals decisions are forum selection clauses and Burford grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.467" offset="9354350">Those are decisions that, by definition, would otherwise be substantive decisions, and if incorporated, as the district court could have here, in a dismissal rather than a remand, would be generally appealable without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.514" offset="9398549">So again, back to Thermtron and Wiswall with respect to the function of mandamus and appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.180" offset="9421224">Those cases stood for the proposition that a refusal to hear and decide, quote unquote, at the outset of the case, was reviewable only by mandamus, and that was the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.433" offset="9458213">That was the basis on which they held an appeal did not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.156" offset="9473051">There's no question today that in fact a refusal to hear and decide on the grounds of subject matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction or Burford grounds themselves is, of course, a final order, and a quote-unquote final decision within section 1291, and clearly reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.677" offset="9535222">Mandamus, on the other hand, today, is generally regarded as an unusual means of interlocutory intervention in very unusual circumstances and, in fact, the kinds of standards that the Court mentioned earlier during the course of Mr. Rubinstein's arguments are specifically formulated in order to avoid allowing mandamus to become a means of evading the finality requirement of section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.502" offset="9622471">In light of Wiswall and Comstock, in general finality principles there's simply no need to apply that function of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.777" offset="9651519">There's simply no need to put those kinds of straitjacket on mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.882" offset="9671999">In fact, if you look at the Thermtron decision itself, Thermtron did not refer to any of those formulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.285" offset="9693628">Thermtron said, of course mandamus is available here because the district court has improperly refused to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="2438.580" offset="9898742">It simply quoted Wiswall and Comstock, and I think it would be fair to look at that case in light of, for example, Moses Cone and the whole arena of finality decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.197" offset="9937299">In fact, I think it is important to do so, because without looking at that sentence and examining it in light of other cases, what you would do is simply confuse the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.513" offset="9966556">You would have a mandamus standard that would essentially, would have to recognize that mandamus readily issued, as Wiswall and Comstock would have recognized, when a court improperly goes to go... improperly refuses to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.401" offset="10226108">If you look at this Court's cases in Burford and Alabama Public Service Commission, and NOPSI, and also the brief treatment of the Burford doctrine in Lumbermen's Mutual, it becomes very clear what the purpose, the justification, and the scope of the Burford doctrine is, for the Court explained very clearly in NOPSI a Federal district court simply does not have discretion to abstain.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.330" offset="12361775">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.830" offset="12363761">There's also a line about postponing the exercise of that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.383" offset="12374001">On the merits, as well, it's an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.445" offset="12386226">The court pointed out it was a peculiar and special circumstance of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.080" offset="12404825">But to go back to the question, in fact, if you look at the relief here, what do you have?</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.224" offset="12421335">You have a straightforward commercial action, and you have a commercial action in which the defendant has moved to compel arbitration on virtually all of these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.961" offset="12460309">Where does the discretion lie?</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.293" offset="12465638">Either we're right on the contract defenses or the liquidator is right, but the court doesn't have any exercise of discretion in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.836" offset="12487790">Furthermore, with respect to the motion to compel, which the liquidator in his reply has now suggested affords some element of discretion... the liquidator's argument is a stay is equitable and therefore there's an equitable element in the case... that's wrong for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.514" offset="12542543">First of all, the Federal Arbitration Act cases of this Court have made it crystal clear that a district court has no discretion to stay in the face of a valid arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.469" offset="12570337">Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act says shall, and that's what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.473" offset="12586324">Secondly, even if the district court had had some element of discretion in refusing to go forward on the motion to compel arbitration, that would not, in turn, confer discretion not to go forward with the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.207" offset="12625299">What the district court should have done here was decide the motion to compel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.771" offset="12635539">With respect to the Burford motion itself, the first thing the district court should have looked at is, do I have any discretion to withhold the relief sought in the motion to compel arbitration?</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.666" offset="12671170">Clearly, the district court did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.778" offset="12679529">There is also no other case that could possibly have supported the exercise of discretion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.891" offset="12708055">Mr. Chief Justice pointed out the Fair Assessment case, but that case, even if it is viewed as an abstention case, is reliant on a long line of comity cases in a very particular area, the tax administration area, and it specifically relied on a holding that in fact a declaration under section 1983 would effectively shut down the tax administration system, and there's nothing remotely comparable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.375" offset="12793945">What the district court's opinion really relies on is some notion that the--</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.099" offset="12812858">That goes to your other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.459" offset="12818291">I mean, it goes not to your appealability... not to your point of whether it's absolutely precluded if nondiscretionary relief is sought, it goes to the point of whether, assuming it isn't absolutely precluded, should it have been granted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.651" offset="12883075">But you acknowledge that Fair Assessment is contrary to your position?</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.988" offset="12916407">--No, we don't acknowledge that Fair Assessment is contrary to our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.782" offset="12927588">What the court in Fair Assessment did was looked at a series of cases in which the court... that arose out of the injunction and declaration area and hold that a particularized comity principle applicable when plaintiffs, Federal plaintiffs sought to in effect shut down State tax systems would justify a similar application with respect to a section 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.495" offset="13014419">That has nothing to do with this case here, nor has the liquidator really ever suggested--</text>

            <text syncTime="3241.992" offset="13112430">--I think the respondent was completely misunderstood, both that case and its exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.454" offset="13126327">The court made clear in Commonwealth Trust Company v. Bradford that it has no application to in personam actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.066" offset="13144717">The problem with the liquidator's argument here is that this is a classic in personam action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.092" offset="13164779">This is an action by an individual on a contract for money damages against a legal person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.638" offset="13187036">That is, the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.591" offset="13194873">That is classic in personam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.351" offset="13201873">The rule of Pennsylvania v. Williams, Penn General and Pennsylvania v. Williams, is an exception to the general rule that in rem jurisdiction must be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.928" offset="13240221">That rule arises from practical necessity only when the court can actually control assets, and therefore, that's a rule that by itself applies only to in rem actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.395" offset="13278046">The exception acknowledges that in some circumstances with respect to in rem actions a Federal court can cede control even though it acquired jurisdiction first to the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.412" offset="13314095">That has... neither the exception nor the rule has anything to do with this case, which the Court has repeatedly said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.135" offset="13333008">To the contrary, there is a long line of decisions in this Court which have repeatedly said that in liquidation contexts, business, insurance companies, trust administration, an in personam claim against a liquidator, or receiver, or whatever outside the liquidation or receivership court does not interfere with that court's control of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.569" offset="13402703">The liquidator argues here that this is in effect in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.753" offset="13411480">He relies on Morgan Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.553" offset="13418690">That was a case to recover possession and control of mortgage notes that were specifically in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.836" offset="13435826">It was a full faith and credit case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.747" offset="13443454">But this clearly is not an in rem case and pulling a couple of phrases out of context about marshalling assets cannot turn it into one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.922" offset="13480130">This is a classic in personam action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.584" offset="13486817">It's a contract action against a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.167" offset="13493086">Clearly, this falls within the scope of the court's cases, but it said that that does not interfere with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.748" offset="13511477">What this case amounts to is a simple, commercial contract action in which the defendant has asked to compel arbitration on virtually all of the contracts at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.355" offset="13549929">The liquidator's argument amounts to an argument that because there are some State law issues here, or potentially State law issues, and because it's inconvenient for the liquidator to defend this, he is entitled to remove it... to defeat Allstate's removal to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.734" offset="13603428">There is no authority that would support that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.306" offset="13613668">There is no exception in the diversity statute for State law issues, clearly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.400" offset="13630073">The very premise of diversity is that Federal courts are fully competent to decide State law issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.552" offset="13650657">Likewise there's no convenience exception in the removal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.625" offset="13662987">Clearly, if Allstate has a right to remove, the liquidator's convenience cannot defeat that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.118" offset="13684930">The case comes down to a simple contract action for money damages.</text>
