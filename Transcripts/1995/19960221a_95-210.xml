            <text syncTime="24.896" offset="244107">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="27.518" offset="254556">During the 200-plus years of our country's history, agriculture has undoubtedly changed dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.963" offset="280365">Over the years, it has become more mechanized, more specialized, and a much larger business.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.977" offset="304397">Yet, as I stand here today in 1996 before this Court, the process of catching chickens remains one of the most rudimentary agricultural processes that one can visualize.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.635" offset="351000">Workers using nothing but their two hands manually catch chickens and place them into cages in order that these chickens can be delivered to market.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.041" offset="388616">One would not think that it would take much analysis to conclude that these workers are agricultural laborers, yet the parties, including us, spend pages and pages of our briefs discussing whether Holly Farms is a farmer when it sends its chicken... sends its live haul crews to the farms of the independent growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.822" offset="463744">We spend pages discussing whether catching chickens is... or whether chickens can be harvested.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.986" offset="488404">We spend pages discussing whether the live haul crews are acting in some way in a relationship with the processing plant, perhaps proving that lawyers and sometimes judges can make issues that are quite simple seem complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.616" offset="546918">Fortunately, I don't have to rely on common sense here today, because we have a statute that Congress carefully considered that specifically defines with some precision what is agriculture.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.688" offset="619225">I think in this case we see that common sense does equate with what Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.653" offset="639078">I just wouldn't want to be making only a common sense argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.424" offset="654125">However, what we have is a statute... and if nothing else from my argument becomes clear today, I hope it will be clear that the chicken catchers and the forklift operators are at a minimum engaged in secondary agriculture within the meaning of section 3(f).</text>

            <text syncTime="152.191" offset="753286">I think that the issue there turns on whether Holly is a farmer, because their activities do not take place on a farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.594" offset="782856">I think logically it makes more sense to address the chicken catchers and the forklift operators first, because the issue in our opinion is much clearer on those, and if we prevail on the chicken catchers and the forklift operators then, even if we lose on the live haul drivers, that undermines the board's bargaining unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.444" offset="902288">Now, suppose Holly Farms didn't ever hatch any chickens.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.318" offset="921723">It was only in the slaughtering and processing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.812" offset="943770">So it goes to the farms, it sends its trucks and teams to the farms, they pick up the chickens, they haul them to the slaughterhouse or the processing plant, and they don't... they're not even in the farming business at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.020" offset="996538">They just pick up the chicks for slaughter and processing.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.692" offset="1315232">We believe that that's the correct analysis, Your Honor, but if we take the chicken catchers and the forklift operators and we look at the statute, which is on page 3 of the blue brief, it says agriculture includes, among other things, the raising of poultry, and any practices performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.129" offset="1420975">Now, we know that the chicken catchers and forklift operators work on a farm, because that is conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.673" offset="1447202">We also know that catching, caging, and loading live chickens constitutes preparation for market because the board really does not dispute that, and the Secretary of Labor has specifically defined those tasks as being preparation for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.005" offset="1512508">We also know that the activities of the chicken catchers and the forklift operators are incidental to farming because section 3(f) specifically states that preparation for market is an activity that is, per se, incidental to farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.203" offset="1573321">The only remaining question is, is it related, incidental to or in conjunction with such farming, and we know that the answer to that question is yes, because the chickens that are caught, caged, and loaded onto the trucks are the same chickens that are raised on the farms on which the truck drivers work, so under the plain language of section 3(f), it is clear that the chicken catchers and forklift operators at a minimum meet the secondary definition of agriculture.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.544" offset="1814693">We also contend that the board's interpretation of phrases such as incidental to farming operations is contrary to this Court's prior decisions in Maneja and Farmers Reservoir, so we think that there's a principle of stare decisis that applies here, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.885" offset="1888045">We also take the position that their interpretation is contrary to the Secretary of Labor's, so for a variety of reasons we think that the board's interpretation in this case is contrary to the plain language of the statute and not reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3487.149" offset="14093080">In particular, section 780.150(k)... excuse me, 151(k), the Secretary of Labor defines the poultry, hauling, grading, cooping and loading poultry are operations that are incidental or that constitute preparation for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.310" offset="14169671">Also, 780.126, which is cited by this Court in Bayside, specifically says that the activities of a processor when performed on the farm, it envisions this very situation we have here, where the processor has title and is dealing with an independent grower, because this is a very common arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.766" offset="14271548">It says that the processor's employees can be engaged in secondary agriculture to the extent that they are working on a farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.311" offset="14305717">So if that statute, if that regulation has any meaning, then the board's position that it's incidental, I mean, the processing argument could be made there, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.130" offset="14348975">it's always incidental to processing in some way if it's a processor, yet this regulation clearly envisions that a processor's employees who work on a farm can be engaged in secondary agriculture.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.972" offset="14412401">--Excuse me?</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.379" offset="14413968">It's 780.126, plus the case that's cited in there by the Secretary of Labor is Johnston v. Cotton Producers, which is a Fifth Circuit case, but it's cited with approval, and in that case, it dealt with a retail store, which... the reg speaks of retail stores and processors in the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.193" offset="14497246">At one time retail stores would hold title to the chickens and then basically perform services for the farmer, and they say in that case that, specifically that chicken, a guy who caught chickens and loaded them on the trucks was engaged in secondary agriculture to the extent that his activities occurred on the farm, so the board's position boils down to the fact that it simply... that it's going to Holly's processing operation, which is inconsistent with this regulation, it's inconsistent with Johnston, it's inconsistent with Maneja, in which the destination of the sugar cane was the processing plant, but that didn't deter the Court from saying that the activities were incidental to farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.091" offset="14664848">So the board has just gone way beyond interpret... you know, reasonable interpretation of a statute in saying that it can only be incidental to processing in light of all these prior decisions and interpretations.</text>
