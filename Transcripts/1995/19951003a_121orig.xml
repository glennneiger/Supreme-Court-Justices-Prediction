            <text syncTime="24.448" offset="237260">Since that time, we have had an opportunity to supplement the trial record from the Federal district court in Vicksburg with more than 200 additional exhibits and more than a dozen new witnesses who have augmented the trial testimony and we believe clarified it perfectly well.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.975" offset="303402">Unfortunately, the reason we're here is because we filed exceptions to the report of the special master which has essentially tracked the district court, which was reversed by the Fifth Circuit in favor of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.230" offset="536414">Mr. Brien Winkley, the chief hydrologist for the Corps of Engineers, said it was never there, and he produced all hydrographic surveys for all known periods of time to show where the thalweg was every year, and those hydrographic surveys were introduced into evidence, carefully explained by Mr. Brien Winkley, by Mr. Mike Mayeux, a professional land surveyor, and by Dr. Ernie Easterly, who is a forensic geographic and fluvial geomorphologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.164" offset="644143">All of them tracked the deepest geologic thalweg of the river, the downstream track of navigation for all periods of time, and none of them could find that the river was ever on the Mississippi levee, on the railroad tracks, across the property of Mr. Surles and Mr. House, or even across the Lake Providence Port Commission property, where Mr. Smith drew his boundary line.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.907" offset="807147">He's asked the question, so the logical conclusion, then, is that the boundary thalweg was west of Stack Island at its formation, and the answer is, that is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.436" offset="1213299">Mr. Surles' father bought the property in 1925, and he testified that the accretion which attached to his property he had leased out to another Louisiana witness, Lonnie Styron, and Lonnie Styron was then at that moment, when he was testifying, forming that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.029" offset="1275575">Now, that accretion was not, I don't believe, formed by Mr. Surles' dad, but rather by Mr. Surles himself, and Mr. Styron.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.965" offset="1391350">Mr. Jarvis' testimony was from an aerial photograph in which he drew a blue ink pen line across the same property and said that was the property of the Houstons.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.606" offset="1433982">Well, that's the Surles, House, Delony, Shorter property.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.660" offset="1454148">Actually, the line that Robert Jarvis drew is more westerly than the line that Austin Smith drew.</text>
