            <text syncTime="138.039" offset="688105">In the second suit before the court, the district court, after trial on the merits, held the petitioner liable for the Tru-Tech judgment on the basis that there was a Federal law cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.218" offset="8084833">I mean, the standard incidences are the compulsory counterclaim, bringing in another party on the compulsory counterclaim, a claim over, under Rule 14... it's for somebody who's brought into court in a defending posture who then wants to litigate another claim which ordinarily wouldn't qualify for Federal court jurisdiction, and so the court says, we recognize that it's unfair to require a party to pay out something that that party claims he can recoup from a third party and make that into two lawsuits instead of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.010" offset="8235925">That's the standard incidences of ancillary jurisdiction, is it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.795" offset="8251077">Justice Ginsburg, that is part of it, and that's the part that comes under 28 U.S.C. 1367, which is called supplemental jurisdiction, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.417" offset="8297574">But as the Court points out in the prevailing opinion in Kokkonen, and I'm referring to... well, I'm not real good at finding page numbers, but it's at page 8... page 4 of the court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.766" offset="8390988">I'll find that in just a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.051" offset="8396108">Generally speaking, we have asserted ancillary jurisdiction in the very broad sense of that term is sometimes used for two separate though sometimes related purposes: 1) to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are in varying respects and degrees factually interdependent, and cases are cited there, and then 2) to enable the court to function successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.534" offset="8502061">That is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its judgment, and cases are cited there, as well as Wright and Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.141" offset="8540513">And we have cited in support of that proposition in addition to Kokkonen the Barnett v. United States case which also went back and quoted the famous case from Mississippi, and I think that was because historically that came up as a Mississippi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.507" offset="8629957">That is, Watson v. Williams, where the supreme court of Mississippi in 1858 said that a court without the power effectually to protect itself against the assaults of the lawless, or to enforce its orders, judgments, or decrees against the recusant parties before it would be a disgrace to the legislation and a stigma upon the age which invented it.</text>
