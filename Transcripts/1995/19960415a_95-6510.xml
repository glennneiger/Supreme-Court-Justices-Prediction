            <text syncTime="9.297" offset="180299">Mr. Olive, the Respondents contend that the points you're raising here were never really raised in the supreme court of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.034" offset="219274">Sometime during your argument, would you address that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark E. Olive</label>
            <text syncTime="21.464" offset="228991">Certainly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.497" offset="237141">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.239" offset="248113">Truth is discovered through fair process.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.740" offset="266085">Truth is forever lost when an attorney in a case through capital sentencing proceedings, for example, utilizes tactics which violate moral standards of fair play.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.009" offset="307149">In Coleman Gray's capital sentencing proceeding, the process was not fair, and the truth will be forever lost unless this Court reinstates the district court's judgment that the State may not mislead defense counsel regarding the determinative issues at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.698" offset="365977">The Commonwealth's position in this case before this Court is that you can mislead.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.533" offset="389278">It's not disputed that there was misleading, and the answer to the misleading is, so what?</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="414774">That doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.286" offset="420312">The State can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.106" offset="427626">The Commonwealth did it, but you're no worse off as a result of it.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="74.790" offset="442359">Well, I don't think the answer is that, so what?</text>
            <text syncTime="78.051" offset="455316">I think the answer is, is that it's not clear that you asked for a continuance, or that that was the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.867" offset="482588">As I read the colloquy in the trial court, both on the morning and the afternoon of the first day of the sentencing hearing, the discussion was on the Watkins case and whether or not this type of evidence is proper at all, and it's certainly open to interpretation that the attorney made a strategic choice not to ask for a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.331" offset="580495">That way he could preserve the objection all the way through, and a continuance might have actually hurt him because the prosecution would have had even more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.529" offset="621246">So that's my concern.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Mark E. Olive</label>
            <text syncTime="120.861" offset="626575">Let me address that, Your Honor, first with the comment that I've searched the respondent's brief and can't find in there the proposition that this did not happen, that the prosecutor did not mislead on day 1 and then progress in the misleading on the subsequent days.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.480" offset="681118">But the part of the record which I'll be referring the Court to, of course, is December 2nd and December 6th, and there were three separate requests, Your Honor, at that... at those points in time for the State to identify what would be introduced under the preferred practice under Peterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.820" offset="742454">When they got to the day where the Commonwealth came in and said, we've changed our mind, there was a discussion about Watkins, and the discussion about Watkins, from the point of view of defense counsel, Your Honor, was the comparison between Watkins and what was going on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.268" offset="800237">And the specific point was made that in Watkins, where murders were introduced at capital sentencing, defense counsel in those cases, in that case was also defense counsel in the case that was being introduced, and there was a charge, and defense counsel knew, had notice of what the facts were involved in that case, and so the Watkins argument really was twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.580" offset="877455">1.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.161" offset="879754">Yes, this evidence is admissible, but in Watkins, it was admissible against an attorney and a defendant that were prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.866" offset="906607">The argument in this case, and making the contrast with Watkins, was specifically that... and I'll give the quote from the record, page 777, it was another... this is defense counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.634" offset="961674">There was another murder that the defense counsel were actively participating in representing the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.398" offset="976720">But contrast this case, page 780.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.530" offset="989259">The defense in this case, Your Honor, was taken by surprise.</text>
