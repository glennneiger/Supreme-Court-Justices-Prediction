I don't see what difference it makes, frankly, whether conceptually you say State law has its cause of action and applies, or whether you say, this is a maritime tort, exclusive jurisdiction of which is given to an admiralty court, saving to suitors, but that's a remedial and not a positive question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.314" offset="4159490">But so... for we have an admiralty tort under Federal law, but by the way, we'll borrow State law, which, of course, is what we should do, unless it's hostile to statutes.</text>
