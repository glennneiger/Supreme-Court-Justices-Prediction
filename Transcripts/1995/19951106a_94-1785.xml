            <text syncTime="687.516" offset="2891144">Since 1957, in Revenue Ruling 57-354, which is quoted at page 48 of the petition appendix, the Commissioner has stated that the status of a claim for refund must be determined as of the time it is filed and that if, as the time it is filed, no return has then been filed, you only get a 2-year look back period.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.640" offset="2971706">The tax court has consistently reached the same conclusion under its own jurisdiction since the early 1970's.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.505" offset="3003158">The suggestion that our position in this case is newly minted simply ignores this historical record, and moreover, factually, the suggestion of respondent that we would routinely pay refund claims in this context is demonstrably incorrect, as the tax court found, because 6512(a) of the Internal Revenue Code says that if a notice of deficiency is issued, and the taxpayer files a claim in tax court, then no refund or credit shall be allowed except as the tax court determines, so in tax court cases the Commissioner has no administrative authority to award a refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.921" offset="3164803">Now, the question that you're really, I think, focusing on is, have we been the same about district court cases and tax court cases, and I think... there's a short answer to that and a long explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.560" offset="3215376">The short answer is, it is not perfectly clear whether in each and every situation the refund periods are supposed to be the same in district court and tax court cases, and there is no basis for assuming that Congress intended them to always be the same, and I'd like to explain the latter part first.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.732" offset="3288101">There's no reason to think Congress necessarily intended the same periods always to apply in district court and tax court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2289.346" offset="9298563">The... there are two or three reasons why that second 2-year rule where no return has been filed does not apply to Mr. Lundy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.513" offset="9335135">The first is, if... the first 3-year rule, 3 years from the date the return is filed, or 2 years from the date the tax is paid, whichever is later, covers all possible situations, because if you assume that an original claim could be filed that was not a return, it would be covered by that first 2-year rule, making the second 2-year rule surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.970" offset="9424996">The second reason is, if the... if it was possible to file a claim for refund that... where no original return has been filed, it would be limited by the first 2-year rule, because the first 2-year rule would provide a longer period of time than the 3-year rule, so that the second 2-year rule would be surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.885" offset="9512663">The second reason is, if, as the IRS contends, that the first sentence of 6511(a) applies to return required taxes, including the second 2-year rule, or if no return was required, and the second sentence of 6511(a) applies to stamps, then there's no rule to recover nonreturn required taxes, so that second 2-year rule, which is surplusage for a return required tax, must apply to nonreturn required tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.367" offset="9642648">Third, as originally enacted in 1954, the statute provided for a limitation period of 3 years from the due date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.563" offset="9687370">It was an absolute minimum 3-year period, so that that second 2-year rule, or if no... 2 years from the date the tax was paid if no return was filed, could not possibly apply to a return required tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.442" offset="9738883">In fact, the tax court in this very case stated that under the '54 code as originally enacted, the taxpayer would have been entitled to a refund even under the deemed claim theory because it was filed within 3 years from the due date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.625" offset="9811608">Now, Congress in 1958 extended that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.007" offset="9833133">The amendment in 1958 was to improve the taxpayer's position to provide that he would be able... because the Commissioner could assess a deficiency within 3 years from the date the return was filed, but the taxpayer was limited to 3 years from the date the return was due, so as the tax court acknowledged that he could have recovered under the language as originally enacted, the tax court judge acknowledged that the purpose of the '58 amendment was to extend the time for filing, and yet what the tax court said was, somehow Congress did not perhaps analyze all the effects of this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.904" offset="10004705">And Your Honor, I submit that this legislative history is convincing evidence that a taxpayer is entitled to a minimum of 3 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.918" offset="13272833">There are two other reasons that claim in this context must be considered to be return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.432" offset="13294880">Treasury Reg 6502-2(b) requires that a claim contain the detailed statement of the grounds upon which the claim is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.467" offset="13331033">That, again, is the same information that if on a document submitted to the IRS under case law and under a '74 revenue ruling would constitute a return and finally, and most important, Regulation 6402-3(a)(1) requires, whereas here no original return has been filed, that the taxpayer must file his claim on a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.204" offset="13429985">So the IRS is asking you to ignore its own regulations and treat the claim referred to in 6512(b)(3)(B) as a defective claim, and I think that's an impermissible construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.084" offset="13481499">I think you have to attribute to Congress an intent that that claim is a valid claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.842" offset="13636457">The principal contention that Respondent raises here was not addressed by the court of appeals and has not been accepted by any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.114" offset="13665610">That contention is that a claim for refund and a return are synonymous concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.830" offset="13684418">Congress plainly didn't intend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.300" offset="13694344">They use the terms quite distinctly and separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.852" offset="13704584">They make the periods of limitation and the refund periods depend upon which came first and how long apart they were, so to reach the conclusion that respondent seeks would literally make nonsense out of 6511(a), 6511(b), and 6512(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.123" offset="13773652">No court has supported that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.515" offset="13787236">The suggestion that somehow this problem would be cured if the respondent could have filed a timely claim is simply off the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.572" offset="13823389">A taxpayer can always file a claim for refund at any time, but that doesn't alter the limitations that apply when the refund claim is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.866" offset="13856617">For example, in this case, if they had filed... if respondent had filed a refund claim on the date the notice of deficiency was issued, he would have been limited to the 2-year refund period, because as of that date he had filed no return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.405" offset="13910743">Respondent simply ignores what's the principal dilemma that he faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.218" offset="13925998">That is, that he was delinquent in filing his return, and Congress made that delinquency relevant in determining the refund jurisdiction of the tax court.</text>
