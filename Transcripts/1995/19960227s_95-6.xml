            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80770">The second case I have to announce is a bit more obvious, it is a Norfolk and Western Railway Co. versus Hiles, No. 95-6.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.653" offset="139284">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.393" offset="166243">Railroad cars are connected by couplers located in both ends of each car.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.464" offset="194559">The couplers attached to a housing mechanism on the car by drawbar that is designed to have some lateral plate to prevent moving cars from the derailing on a curved track.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.674" offset="239386">As a result of this lateral movement, drawbars may remain off-center when cars are uncoupled and must be realigned manually to ensure proper coupling.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.769" offset="287764">Respondent William Hiles injured his back while attempting to realign an off-center drawbar and sued petitioner Norfolk and Western Railroad Company in Illinois State Court arguing that the misaligned drawbar was a violation of Section 2 of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.620" offset="367177">This law prohibits railroads from using cars that are not equipped with couplers that will automatically couple on impact and uncoupled without the necessity of employees going between the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.343" offset="422138">The Trial Court ruled in favor of Hiles and the Appellate Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.897" offset="440319">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.703" offset="447529">Hiles argues that the statute was violated because the car would not couple until he realigned the drawbar and he could not do that without going between the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.699" offset="491519">We disagree primarily because the language of Section 2 requires only that railroads equip their cars with standardized automatic couplers.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.395" offset="530285">Section 2 does not independently prevent railroad employees from going between railcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.354" offset="558184">We have previously recognized that employees must take certain preliminary steps to ensure proper performance of automatic couplers before a court can find a violation of Section 2 and today we hold that realigning a misaligned drawbar is one of those preliminary steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.611" offset="631118">We decline to adapt an interpretation of Section 2 that suggest a misaligned drawbar is by definition a malfunctioning drawbar nor can we accept Hiles suggestion that Section 2 required the railroads to develop new technology for automatic realignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.376" offset="702171">The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.770" offset="715754">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
