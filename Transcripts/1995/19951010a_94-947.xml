            <text syncTime="18.766" offset="209408">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.721" offset="229261">For almost 30 years, the National Labor Relations Board consistently and repeatedly has held that a person who applies for or holds a job with an employer that he intends to try to organize, and who will be compensated by a union for his organizational activity, is an employee within the meaning of section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.372" offset="367814">That section is set forth on page 2 of our brief, and was last interpreted and applied by this Court in its 1984 decision in Sure-Tan Incorporated against the NLRB, and we are content to use the words of this Court in Sure-Tan in describing this provision, and I'm quoting now from page 891 of Volume 467 U.S., the breadth of section 2(3)'s definition is striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.900" offset="541894">the act squarely implies to "any employee".</text>
            <text syncTime="107.864" offset="565822">The only limitations are specific exemptions for agricultural laborers, domestic workers, individuals employed by their spouses or parents, individuals employed as independent contractors or supervisors, and individuals employed by a person who is not an employer under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.063" offset="670626">The Court then concluded that undocumented aliens are not among the few groups of workers expressly exempted by Congress, and they therefore plainly come within the broad statutory definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.690" offset="813045">--Our position is that he is therefore an employee unless there are reasons, in interpreting the National Labor Relations Act, why an implied exemption should be found, a question for the board to address initially, and the only example in which this Court found an implied exemption was the case of NLRB v. Bell Aerospace which involved managerial employees, and the Court in reliance upon the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act and its overruling of this Court's decision in the Packard case by adding to this list of exemptions supervisors has... that Congress had relied on the notion that managerial employees would be excluded sort of a fortiori from supervisors, and that the board had always, while not holding them not to be employees, had always placed them in separate bargaining units from other employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.957" offset="11658146">That's correct, and I believe... one of the reasons that I think it is is that when Congress went on to explain in the definition of employee, they said that it included individuals who were out of work, or whose work ceased because of a current labor dispute, or an unfair labor practice, and who had not obtained regular and substantially equivalent employment, which implies that there are other situations which would not be included, and it seems to me that what it does is, it shows that they were trying to take... retain the core.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.217" offset="11839226">I believe that the act says that the purpose... its purpose is to protect the right to organize, and the board at page 8 of its brief says that they interpret it as, that it's to promote organization, and I would submit that what the board is doing in that situation is it is saying that there is a preferred choice, and that they are going to go out and support that, and to give the status of employee to a person who's contractually prohibited from exercising the rights of an employee under section 7 of the act, and I think that that's inconsistent with the 1947 amendments to the act that said that employees had the right to refrain from any of those activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.438" offset="12036085">I think that that set up two equally acceptable choices, and the board was supposed to be an impartial referee, and I believe in this case, they have moved from that position, and for that reason I don't think that they have due deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3117.620" offset="12604823">I believe that the board is assuming that the union agents are entitled to the protection of the act, and that their analysis begins with the premise that these people are employees and entitled to the protection of the act, and then the question becomes, have they done something to lose that protection?</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.059" offset="12714537">I would submit to you that it is inappropriate to assume that they are employees and to make this status determination as we make it in other instances of supervisors, independent contractors, make that independent of the presumptions of protected activity, independent of the motive of the employer for engaging in activity that raises the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.583" offset="12976702">I think that the control that the union exercised over the union agent in this case is illustrated by the supernatural persistence he displayed in soliciting Town &amp; Country employees in the face of repeated rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.454" offset="13048173">These employees were so upset by the pressure that the union agent was putting on them that they were on the verge of quitting, and this is another way that the union can be effective without going the high road, because they can focus on those employees who are opposed to unionization and in effect force them off the work force, which means either that they will be replaced by someone who might be more favorable, or that they may make it impossible for the employer to perform, and that nonunion employer is off the job.</text>
