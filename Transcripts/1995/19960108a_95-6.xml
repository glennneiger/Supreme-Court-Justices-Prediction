            <text syncTime="21.485" offset="218838">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.755" offset="227928">This case involves the proper interpretation of section 2 of the Safety Appliance Act, which is quoted on page 2 of the petitioner's brief, and which states that it shall be unlawful for a railroad to use on its line... excuse me... any car not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.610" offset="307340">In this case the respondent, a switchman at the rail yard in St. Louis, Missouri, injured his back while attempting to pull a drawbar into alignment that had become misaligned almost certainly as a consequence of having been disconnected from a prior car on a curve.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.149" offset="425518">And so at the time that the statute we're reviewing was adopted, it was necessary for the drawbar to be physically adjusted at times between the cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.805" offset="468150">Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.656" offset="475569">As the D.C. Circuit said in the Lewis case, that if you accept the notion that any misaligned drawbar violates the Safety Appliance Act, then every railroad has been in noncompliance with that act since 1898 when it went into effect, which means that every railroad has been subject since 1898 to $100 fines for every such violation, which might have actually saved the Federal Government its budget problems today, but clearly would have done so on the back of the railroads in ways I don't think Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.403" offset="582462">What we have here is an injury that falls far afield from what Congress had in mind in 1893 when it acted to protect railroad workers from the possibility of being crushed between railroad cars as a consequence of the old-fashioned link and coupling devices used.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.457" offset="1030723">That seems to say the... there can be no fine against the railroad but there is a guarantee to the worker.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="235.105" offset="1073355">I guess I would have two responses to that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.576" offset="1083177">First, I think to the extent that that suggests that there might be some potential claim as a matter of negligence or even a claim under the Safety Appliance Act where the only evidence is a malfunction and no evidence put forward by the railroad as to why the malfunction occurred, that is, to show that... simply a case of a misaligned drawbar or an unopened knuckle... sure, there could be recovery under those circumstances, although I wouldn't expect that to happen very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.012" offset="1176905">The alternative, though, is it's difficult to square the broader understanding of that language with the statutory scheme because it's reasonably clear to me that in order to recover under... through FELA for a Safety Appliance Act violation, it has to be a Safety Appliance Act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.133" offset="1241479">You cannot stretch the Safety Appliance Act to cover situations that it wasn't designed to cover simply because you end up ultimately obtaining your recompense through FELA as a technical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.100" offset="1285260">It seems to me you'd have to conclude that a misaligned drawbar is a violation of section 2.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="292.932" offset="1304591">Are you saying politely that Judge MacKinnon was incorrect to the extent that he said that the... that there is a guarantee of the performance?</text>

            <text syncTime="302.058" offset="1341163">I think you can justify that statement in the very limited sense in which this Court has in the past recognized that if all the proof you have is a malfunction and nothing else comes in, there could be liability under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.897" offset="1392467">To the extent that that's what his statement means, I don't have any quarrel with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.111" offset="1421306">Well, you say that if there's just a malfunction and no evidence produced on the part of the railroad, there could be liability.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="335.151" offset="1473551">Well, this Court's decisions suggest that there are essentially two ways to demonstrate a violation of the Safety Appliance Act: either there has been a malfunction of the coupler or there has been a defect in the coupler.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.687" offset="1511690">In the malfunctioning situation, what the Court says is, we will presume, if it malfunctioned, that it had something to do with an equipment failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.110" offset="1541365">But what the Court said quite plainly in Affolder was that that presumes in the first instance that the couplers were set to operate normally, and if the couplers were not set, in that case by the way, opening of the knuckle... in our case I submit by way of aligning the drawbar so that the knuckles would in fact connect... then it seems to me, as the Court said in Affolder, we would have a good defense under that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.366" offset="1634361">So, really the way the particular problem arises simply is a technical kind of pleading problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.671" offset="1655572">If there had been in this case a failed coupling, I think it might have been the case that we would have been required to come forward to show that it was merely still a misaligned drawbar problem, but in this case there was no malfunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.358" offset="1702279">There was no effort in coupling these particular cars and, therefore, we were never even put to the necessity of making that particular proof, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="400.262" offset="1733940">So, you say your case differs from the hypothetical in that there was no malfunction here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="404.176" stopTime="519.299">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="404.176" offset="1749613">That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.656" offset="1755569">We have no malfunction and we have no defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.666" offset="1763510">And when you don't have either of those things, I would have said that the Safety Appliance Act issue comes to a close.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.661" offset="1783572">Respondents, however, because they can't satisfy the traditional standards that this Court has adopted has posed two much broader tests to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.697" offset="1819726">One is, is that anytime you have a coupling problem which requires an employee to go between the ends of two cars, tracking the end language of section 2 of the Safety Appliance Act, that then any injuries that arise under those circumstances ought to be compensable under section 2 through FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.018" offset="1889003">And our answer to that is that that simply defies the language of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.090" offset="1905303">That... this is not a statute that imposes operational restrictions on how railroads go about their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.883" offset="1928395">What the language about going between two cars does is fairly describe the type of coupler that Congress meant to require in 1893.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.821" offset="1960160">And a little bit of history here goes a long way to giving content to that particular phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.312" offset="1978132">What we knew at the time was that in 1893 automatic couplers were fairly new to the scene, and Congress did not want to mandate any particular type of coupling and uncoupling mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.160" offset="2021496">It simply wanted to describe the type of a device that it wanted implemented by 1898, and therefore what the... as the Court again in the D.C. Circuit said in the Lewis case, what we know is that that independent requirement about going between cars is not itself an independent prohibition under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.451" offset="2094743">Part of the reason we know that it can't be really a significant independent requirement under the act is it doesn't even modify, by its own terms, the fact of coupling.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.998" offset="2132882">Now, this Court has applied that language to the coupling as a reasonable, I think, interpretation of probably Congress' intent, but it seems quite unlikely that Congress would have meant to make going between cars the ultimate sort of sine qua non of a violation of the Safety Appliance Act and not had that language actually modify, by its own terms, that coupling process.</text>
