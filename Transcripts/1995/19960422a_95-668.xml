            <text syncTime="20.175" offset="209846">Some 8 years ago we started what I thought was a run-of-the-mill, garden-variety type labor dispute which has grown and grown, and here we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.290" offset="246313">In the course of a collective bargaining dispute, the... a strike arose; picketing took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.575" offset="275466">Immediately during the course of this garden-variety dispute, 40 percent of the employees, the bargaining unit, crossed the line, the same 40 percent which, it's a small unit, that 40 percent is only 9 employees, were badmouthing the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.016" offset="345160">The employer, during the course of this 5 or 6-week strike, obtained the belief that because of the 40 percent the union did not have the tremendously strong percentage of support, and it shot across the bow of the union bargaining position a rather extreme shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.940" offset="436902">It beefed up its contract proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.444" offset="446933">However, the significant point, when it beefed it up, it did not have, then, reason to believe that the union was not a majority representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.189" offset="477862">It had every reason... in fact, the... it would... to believe that the union still maintained its majority status, but it shot this across the bow of the union, this beefed-up union proposal, and at that time the negotiations are broken off.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.798" offset="536272">The very next day, the union abandoned the picket line, the pickets went down, and a number of extraordinary events took place over the next 3 business days.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.825" offset="584442">Everyone... almost everyone came back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.959" offset="600951">Of those who came back to work, a number of them did the same as their predecessors, the 40 percent who had come back earlier, had crossed the picket line, were knocking the union, being very critical of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.937" offset="652883">In fact, four additional employees resigned from the union after they came back, spoke to company representatives and said, we don't need the union, I don't know why we wanted a union in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.603" offset="699590">Three of these individuals who were thus bad-mouthing the union had been picketing that Friday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.710" offset="728011">Friday afternoon they were in saying to the company, ah, we never needed a union here in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.537" offset="10311293">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.329" offset="10318398">I do want to emphasize the manner in which the First Circuit dealt with this case, and it dealt with it on the basis of being a loss of majority case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.156" offset="10357791">If I may just briefly, in addition to the reference at page 3a, the Court makes identical references on pages 80a, 82a, and in the specific order of remand to the board at page 83a it continuously refers to the issue as being a loss of majority, and it is easy to somehow distinguish, or sometimes confuse the distinguishing factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.952" offset="10460922">In fact, in this case there is a reference to the Chicago Tribune, the Seventh Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.186" offset="10477849">That was a clear loss of majority case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.357" offset="10486522">In the board's brief before this Court it says that has nothing to do with that, that was a loss of majority case, and this is a good faith doubt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.023" offset="10517242">Yet if... I direct the Court's attention to the board's own decision in this Auciello case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.456" offset="10538976">How does it refer to... on seven different pages of the board's decision in this case, it refers to the Chicago Tribune case as being a good faith doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.271" offset="10574189">It continuously says the employer raised its good faith doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.044" offset="10589340">So sometimes the distinction between the two is not as clear as we would like it to be, so I think we have adequately raised the actual loss of majority in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.411" offset="10630822">Notwithstanding the fact it was not expressly raised in the answer to the board, it was raised a number of times in the briefs, and that's how the court of appeals addressed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.725" offset="10664050">It remanded it to the board to deal with an actual loss of majority scenario, and the board can't pick and choose, I would submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.131" offset="10693621">While... even though the First Circuit told us to do it, number 1, quickly, we are not going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.892" offset="10708667">It had told us to deal with the actual loss of majority case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.616" offset="10719639">It can't dictate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.567" offset="10727371">That's up to the court of appeals, and I think the issue is a live one before this Court.</text>
