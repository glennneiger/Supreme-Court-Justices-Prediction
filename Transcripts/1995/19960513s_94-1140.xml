            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="81485">The opinion of the Court in No. 94-1140, 44 Liquormart Inc. versus Rhode Island will be 1announced by Justice Stevens.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="9.366" stopTime="361.012">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="9.366" offset="118892">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.661" offset="144074">In 1956, the Rhode Island legislature enacted two separate prohibitions against advertising the retail price of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.842" offset="180750">The first applies to vendors licensed in Rhode Island and prohibits them from advertising “in any manner whatsoever” the price of any alcoholic beverage offered for sale in the State with the exception of price tags and signs located on the licensed establishment’s premises but not visible from the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.899" offset="260998">The Second Statute applies to the Rhode Island’s news media and categorically bans the publication or broadcast of advertisement that make reference to the price of any alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.571" offset="307705">In 1991, in response to complaints from competitors that a license Rhode Island liquor retailer 44 Liquormart was advertising the prices of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.273" offset="346576">The State brought enforcement proceedings and assess the $400.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.688" offset="364234">44 Liquormart paid the fine and then joined by Peoples Super Liquor Stores, a Massachusetts liquor retailer patronize by Rhode Island residents, initiated this action in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.014" offset="409478">They sought a declaratory judgment that the two state laws in the implementing regulations violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.037" offset="437586">Rhode Island defended the price advertising prohibition as a reasonable means of serving its legitimate interest in promoting temper.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.201" offset="466216">The state argued that the advertising prohibition would reduce alcoholic consumption by raising the retail price and increasing the search time for the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.444" offset="503206">It also argued that its determination on this was entitled to a particular deference under the Twenty-first Amendment which repeal the Eighteenth Amendment and delegated to the several state the power to prohibit commerce in or the use of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.556" offset="563705">After hearing the extensive expert testimony on the question, the District Court concluded that the State’s pricing price advertising prohibition would have no significant impact on alcohol consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.242" offset="606442">It also concluded that the Twenty-first Amendment did not diminish the burden that the First Amendment ordinarily imposes on the State when it seeks to regulate the dissemination of commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.624" offset="647924">Accordingly, the District Court held that the price advertising regulation violated the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.025" offset="681570">An appeal the First Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.417" offset="691078">It found the inherent merit in the State's contention that the regulation of price advertising would reduce consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.646" offset="716052">Relying on our decision in California against LaRue, the First Circuit also concluded that Twenty-first Amendment gave the State’s advertising ban an added presumption of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.253" offset="758474">The First Circuit then held that under this Court’s decision in Central Hudson, Posadas, and Edge Broadcasting the State prohibition should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.504" offset="799434">Alternatively, the First Circuit concluded that our summary action in an earlier case involving a regulation of price advertising in Ohio, Queensgate Investment Co. compelled the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.891" offset="848963">We granted certiorari to give more thorough analysis to the importance of First and Twenty-first Amendment question is presented by the regulation of liquor price advertising then we provided when we decline to accept jurisdiction of the Queensgate appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.216" offset="902252">For the reasons stated in four separate opinions filed with the Clerk, we now unanimously reverse the judgment of Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.961" offset="933286">In some parts of my opinion, I speak for the majority of the Court in another parts for only a plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.159" offset="958050">In a portion of the opinion that does command the majority, we hold that the Twenty-first Amendment does not qualify the protections afforded by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.299" offset="990651">To the extent, our decision in California v. LaRue to the contrary we disavow its reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.824" offset="1016773">In another portion of my opinion that also commands the majority we hold that Rhode Island has failed to meet the “heavy burden” of justifying a complete ban on alcohol price advertising that the First Amendment has made applicable to the several states by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on attempts to restrict commercial speech that is the one at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.022" offset="1105485">In a part of my opinion that has joined only by Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Ginsburg, we respond that the State's so-called greater includes the lesser argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.501" offset="1143415">The State argues that because it has the broad power to prohibit any sales of alcoholic beverages, it must also possess the lesser power to restrict advertisement offering such beverages for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.195" offset="1190226">Although we do not dispute, the proposition that greater powers include lesser one, we disagree we the suggestion that the State's power to regulate commercial activity is greater than its power to ban truthful nonmisleading commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.888" offset="1248949">Contrary to the major premise of the State’s argument, we think that it quite clear that banning speech may sometimes prove far more intrusive than banning conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.597" offset="1283849">We reject the assumption that words are necessary less vital to freedom than actions or that logic somehow proves that the power to prohibit an activity is necessary greater than the power to suppress speech about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.552" offset="1335676">As a matter of First Amendment doctrine, the State's syllogism is untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.593" offset="1351767">The text of the First Amendment makes clear that the Constitution presume those attempts to regulate speech are more dangerous than attempts to regulate conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.857" offset="1384891">That presumption accords that the essential role that the free flow of information plays in a democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.963" offset="1413312">As a result, the First Amendment directs the government may not suppress speech as easily as it may suppress conduct and the speech restrictions can not be treated as simply another means that the government may use to achieve its ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.588" offset="1467751">Justice O’Connor has filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment in which the Chief Justice, Justice Souter and Justice Breyer has joined; Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have each also filed separate opinions concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
