            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 66, Case-Swayne Company Incorporated versus Sunkist Growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.663" offset="178030">Mr. Henderson, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Henderson</label>
            <text syncTime="25.342" offset="204779">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.289" offset="212511">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.108" offset="239783">This is the treble damage action for violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.124" offset="259845">Case-Swayne Company, a small factory of food products, including orange, juice brought the action against Sunkist Growers Inc., the dominant citrus fruit combination of California and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.830" offset="318673">The District Court directed a verdict against Case-Swayne.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.466" offset="337272">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Case-Swayne had made a prime facie case for the jury on violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.394" offset="380949">But the courtroom, one Judge dissenting that Sunkist had complied with Section 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.675" offset="426088">This is the only issue, the writ of certiorari is concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.745" offset="450330">We invite the Court's attention to Judge Walter Ely dissenting opinion on this issue at page 185 of the record because this opinion states Case-Swayne's position on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.351" offset="528802">Your Honors, the single question before this Court on the writ of certiorari is the interpretation of a single sentence from Section 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.186" offset="584077">This is the first sentence of the Section and it contains only 50 words.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.434" offset="605080">Now, in substance it provides members of Capper-Volstead Association must be engaged in the production of agricultural products as farmers or as specifically pertaining to this case as fruit growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.694" offset="690134">Nothing could appear clear than this language and we submit at least in this case the language means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.241" offset="732348">For the intent of Congress was that only actual farmers, actual growers, the people who till the soil could organize a Capper-Volstead Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.964" offset="783235">In our opening brief, we quote from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.296" offset="800580">This history explicitly shows Congress intended that only actual farmers, the people who grow the crop could form a Capper-Volstead Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.444" offset="865155">I call Your Honor's attention particularly to the colloquy between Senator's Cummins, Kellogg, and Townsend quoted on pages 9 and 10 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.285" offset="920534">These Senators wanted to make certain that the specific language of Section 1 which is under consideration in this writ would not permit the middle man such as flour mills and packers who in a broad sentence are engaged in the production of agricultural products to organize co-operations and fix the prices of their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.287" offset="1020531">Indeed the history shows further, it shows that the purpose of the act was to permit farmers to organize and market their products through an association so that they would not be at the mercy of the middleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.414" offset="1089076">The acts legislated history is crowded with preferences showing this intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.475" offset="1113318">We have found no legislative history indicated any intent to the Congress contrary and some case has referred this to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.870" offset="1170892">Now here, let's look at the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.023" offset="1187506">The stipulation is very specific, it clearly shows the inclusion of the middleman in Sunkist membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.555" offset="1225644">Approximately 15% of Sunkist members are not farmers, they are not growers, they are not Capper-Volstead Associations but normally private corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.634" offset="1281860">Now, in the Capper-Volstead stipulation these members are denominated agencies, associations and that is not a correct denomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.440" offset="1337135">They are not associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.052" offset="1347584">They are commercial packing houses and if Your Honors with bear with me, I'm going to try to use that term because that's what they are, commercial packing houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.089" offset="1395754">They perform a traditional middleman function in the citrus fruit industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.899" offset="1426996">They pick, they wash, pack and market the citrus fruit of growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.048" offset="1459597">Now the packing house is not an invention of Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.778" offset="1478510">They didn't invent the packing house and they're assisting before that Sunkist system was established packing houses were commercial ventures and during the period of this action some 16 to 18 of these commercial packing houses marketed their byproduct fruit through the Morgan Ward Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.650" offset="1581955">So Your Honors when Sunkist admitted these commercial packing houses to the extent of 15% of its total membership, Sunkist greatly increased its control of oranges in the relevant market.</text>
