            <text syncTime="13.563" offset="157654">We are remanding the case and now everyone has notice”.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.886" offset="174895">Therefore, if this Court should reverse the Tenth Circuit, it must decide this serious procedural due process question.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.076" offset="207705">We submit a considerations of fundamental fairness required that the Commission hold supplemental proceedings in which all parties will have notice of the quality standard and price reduction issue and be afforded an opportunity to present full and complete evidence on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.832" offset="278653">In conclusion, let me say that it is our primary position in this case as expressed in our application for certiorari that the Tenth Circuit decision should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.248" offset="324315">We believed that the limited remand required by that Court will give the Commission the opportunity to fill obvious procedure and evidentiary gaps in this -- its first area ratings firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.668" offset="374053">Certainly such a remand would remove the procedural due process question we have raised and as indicated by the Tenth Circuit on such remands perhaps the Commission will allow producers are gathering costs since such costs allowed in pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.823" offset="434657">However, if this Court should reverse the Tenth Circuit decision, we submit that the orders of the Commission must still be remanded for the limited purpose of having the Commission determine what increment to its area well head prices should be allowed producers such as Machlup to perform extensive gathering and trading services after the gas is produced but before it is delivered to the pipeline purchasers.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.953" offset="2131153">My name is Justin Wolf.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.655" offset="2137945">I appear here today in behalf of Standard Oil Company of Texas, to argue the single point that we have raised in our very short brief, the point that we have persistently raised before the Commission on rehearing and before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.062" offset="2215581">Assuming the propriety of familiar rate base, cost of service, methods for prescribing the rate for new gas-well gas on an industry basis in the Permian Basin area.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.158" offset="2287992">It is our contention if the Commission has committed a grievous, serious error in it's computation of that cost of service and error that goes to the very heart of utility regulation and cost of service specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.822" offset="2358627">They have allowed an earning of their allowed 12% return -- rate of return on a rate base that is equal to a little more than half of what the Commission has found is the industry's prudent investment in the production of new gas-well gas specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.569" offset="2457684">They have allowed a 12% return on a rate base of 43.45 cents where they had found that the prudent investment rate base of the industry is 79 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.497" offset="2529364">The error of the Commission really amounts to saying that it would be proper for any regulated industry to charge rate certificate to be permitted to be char -- to charge rates which would not yield the required reasonable rate of return during the first period of a capital recovery period in this instance a hypothetical 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.447" offset="2645138">In anticipation of the regulated industry at the same rates will recover or earn an excessive rate of return during the last half of that capital recovery period, in this instance, the last 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.134" offset="2707937">We submit that this is fundamentally in conflict with the utility law that has been developed by this Court at least beginning in Bluefield in 262, in Los Angeles Gas Electric in 289 U.S., and the West Ohio case in 294 and indeed is a hypothesis rejected by the Commission itself in its South Carolina generating case and decision in 16, Federal Power Commission reports, page 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.558" offset="2849625">Moreover, the cost of the natural gas producing industry is -- it has been an aggressive, dynamic one which regulates year-in, year-out, invest large new sums to find and develop new reserves to meet a constantly increasing market demands to which reference has made -- inlaid before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.336" offset="2964668">That natural gas producing industry will never, in the foreseeable future, reach a state of 50% equation of its new gas-well gas reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.277" offset="3020466">Yet, under the Commission's formula, the gas producing industry must reach a stage of 50% depletion before it can begin to recruit its earned -- it's under earnings through alleged accessories.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.619" offset="3093817">The Commission treats each 79 cent capital investment to which it refers in its opinion as if it were a single asset and as if it were the only asset of the gas producing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.739" offset="3158288">The fact is that each year the industry has a constantly changing and a constantly expanding package of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.182" offset="3200084">As of the test year in 1960, there were some depleted properties, some brand new ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.658" offset="3229968">Others come all.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.280" offset="3236446">In the foreseeable future, the totality of the package that is what the industry has, is a package of gas, new gas-well gas producing assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.030" offset="3287542">In the foreseeable future the package will never reach a stage of 50% depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.058" offset="3311574">Both the Commission and the Courts, particularly the Fifth Circuit, have recognized that in a growing, expanding industry, you cannot, do not in the foreseeable future, reach a stage of 50% efficient or 50% depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.540" offset="3389524">When I say that the Commission has recognized this, I refer to the relatively recent opinion in the Alabama, Tennessee Case at 31, Federal Power Commission reports, and the Fifth Circuit's decision affirming the Commission's decision reporting in 359 F.2d.--</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.365" offset="4476844">In the 20 minutes allotted to Mobil, an attempt will be -- had been made to discuss various points, the moratorium, the ban on flexible pricing clauses, the last clean rate argument, the automatic application of Section 7, in the Section 7 the inline argument, the minimum rate argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.561" offset="4541628">The first argument, I'd like to conserve, would be that of the moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.714" offset="4558242">As was stated yesterday, the Commission by its order placed an absolute ban on all contractually allowable rate increases above the area maximum from the date -- from the effective date of its decision which is September 1, 1965 until January 1, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.785" offset="4634520">That is true that this moratorium will expire (Inaudible) before the Court renders its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.826" offset="4654686">But it has a great deal of importance not only for Permian but for the other area rate proceedings that are now in progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.405" offset="4681017">And I don't think it needs to be emphasized to the Court that the rules, the holding in the Permian decision will set the basis for the other area rate proceedings which encompass as the Solicitor told you yesterday some 93% of the gas flowing in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.388" offset="4796897">And so it could expire, but the issue is far from moot and the overall approach of the area of concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.208" offset="4828244">The Commission attempts to justify the moratorium in two basic ways, statutory and by “reasonableness test.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.325" offset="4856665">Now first, it's statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.302" offset="4864606">The Commission tends to use that to be thereafter observed language in Section 5 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.926" offset="4887071">Now, it is Mobil's contention that to allow -- that to be thereafter observed the language to be so used completely ignores the entire rate changing structure of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.393" offset="4924897">Section 5 can be used only by the Commission by certain state agencies or by certain distribution companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.040" offset="4955512">A natural gas company cannot institute a Section 5 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.251" offset="4972335">On the other hand, Section 4 (e) and Section 4 (d) which are the rate changing Section of the Act which are available to a natural gas company to change its existing rates cannot be invoked by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.851" offset="5022804">We think there's a complete disregard by the Commission in using that to be thereafter language of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.496" offset="5053315">Now previously this Court in the Mobil case, in the Memphis case, and in the Sunray DX case held emphatically that under the Natural Gas Act contrary to other methods of regulation employed by federal agencies, the regulation and the imposition of regulation by the Commission is superimposed on private contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.193" offset="5140146">And this Court in Mobil specifically held that when a contract allows the producer to file -- not a producer but the seller of natural gas, the natural gas company, the producer wasn't involved but it's the same principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.217" offset="5196257">When he's -- when his contract allows a filing for an increased rate, he may file under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.791" offset="5222588">Now the mere filing under Section 4 (d) does not mean that the filed rate becomes the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.553" offset="5249546">Congress foresaw this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.441" offset="5261145">And before the file rate can become the just and reasonable rate, the Commission must find itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.575" offset="5285700">That is true that after five months, the rate can be placed into effect but subject to refund if the Commission so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.116" offset="5315793">There are number of refunds being ordered in this case before the Court today which were put into effect under this very same power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.837" offset="5342751">So in effect, we can only have a balancing of consumer and investor interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.711" offset="5358216">The producers are allowed to place their rates into effect if they are suspended after five months but subject to refunding and under bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.678" offset="5390085">Now, the Commission also attempts to use as a justification for the moratorium certain decisions by this Court which have been developed in the interim period pending development of the area method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.269" offset="5436479">This started in the now famous case of CATCO where this Court said that it was up to the Commission to hold the line pending determination of just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.636" offset="5477961">Now, the hold of the line theory has been applied by the Commission in numerous ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.982" offset="5495306">One of the ways is by the imposition of a moratorium on either a temporary or permanent certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.540" offset="5517563">In the Hunt case, decided with this case in nine -- presided by this Court in 1964, it was held that the Commission could impose a moratorium on a temporary certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.073" offset="5559672">Now, the moratorium is on filing under Section 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.356" offset="5572838">At -- in the Hunt Case, it was told until the permanent certificate was issued but now in Callery, in 1965, this Court then said that the Commission has the authority under Section 7 not under Section 4, under Section 7 of the Act imposed a moratorium pending determination of just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.750" offset="5650369">The whole concept that hold the line, all the doctrines developed and the hold the line theory have been approved by this Court pending determination of just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.896" offset="5694986">The Permian decision, the decision now before this Court is a determination of what the Commission hopes is just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.282" offset="5728528">This is not an interim measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.916" offset="5739081">In the Permian decision, the period of pendency has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.630" offset="5753919">Now, the Commission also attempts to use the power given to it under Section 16 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.344" offset="5776697">And very briefly I like to say that Section 16, in and out of itself, is not an independent grant of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.013" offset="5799476">It very specifically states to be used to carry out the provisions of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.251" offset="6372394">As I've stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.695" offset="6382111">Turning now to the flexible pricing clause ban, this issue has been before the Court before in the Texaco case decided in 1964 also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.444" offset="6421191">This Court said that the Commission by the use of the rule making authority could ban certain flexible pricing clauses in contracts to be filed with the Commission in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.393" offset="6464972">Now that is not the issue presently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.804" offset="6478555">The issue presently before the Court is the order of the Commission in Permian banning flexible pricing clauses in contracts which will formally file with the Commission which were formally approved and with -- on which formal approval of various producers committed their gas interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.392" offset="6552952">Now it is true that under Section 5 of the Act as this Court made clear in Texaco, the Commission can change existing contracts but in a matter which is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.584" offset="6597674">And as this Court said in Hope, the just and reasonable standard is a balancing of consumer and investor interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.561" offset="6621602">And Mobil submits it's not a balance of consumer investor interest to completely eliminate these clauses and thereby trap the producers in a situation from which they cannot extricate themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.796" offset="6674578">Turning now if I may with the permission of the Court, the last clean rate argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.622" offset="6693909">This is a very difficult argument to state and in the interest of conserving time, I refer the Court to the brief which Mobil has filed, pages 66 to 72 in which we have set forth a very detailed example of what we're contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.061" offset="6755662">Basically, the contention is, that once the Commission has permanently certified a rate then while it may reduce that rate perspectively under Section 5 (a), it cannot because a Section 4 (e) increase has been filed, go behind its permanent rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.968" offset="6831208">Now this Court in the Hunt case stated that once a permanent certificate is granted, the Commission can correct that importer rate only under Section 5 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.140" offset="6875930">And as long ago again as the Hope case, in CATCO and again in Callery, this Court has been very straight in saying that the Commission has no power to fix rates retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.853" offset="6934758">And once the rate is fixed, this maybe reduced prospectively but not retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.156" offset="6955969">Now, the Commission and in particular the various California producers, seem to contend that because a Section 4 (e) increase has been filed on top of a permanently certified rate, that a reduction maybe made down to the area rate in complete disregard of this permanent certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.483" offset="7037262">Again, I refer the Court to pages 66 and 72 of Mobil brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.511" offset="7057429">Another point with the permission of the Court which I would like to bring your attention is discussed in pages 72 to 77 of Mobil's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.264" offset="7092433">And this involves the automatic application by the Commission of the just and reasonable rate which they purport to have found -- to Section 7 proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.616" offset="7137886">The rate is based on a 1960 test year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.979" offset="7151261">And under the Commission's order as the Mobil interprets it, if a certificate were filed today and an attempt were made under Section 7 to have that rate certified, the Commission would use the rate which it has decided on the 1960 test year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.599" offset="7217716">Section 7 (e) of the Act states the certificates are to be based on the present public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.199" offset="7248123">And we think that that means a present showing and not a 1960 test year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.553" offset="7273618">Now, the Tenth Circuit did not decide this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.681" offset="7286053">And so Mobil's position on this must be that if this Court affirms the Commission, then this one issue should be remanded back down to the Tenth Circuit for their initial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.335" offset="7332760">It has never been decided by the Tenth Circuit and they reserved their decision on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.709" offset="7350209">Of course, if the Commission is reversed, then the issue would go back to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.248" offset="7372361">Turning now if I may to the minimum rate, I have dwelled at length upon the integrity of contracts and the superimposition of rate regulation on private contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.196" offset="7428159">Now, I would like to turn to the Commission's minimum rate are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.724" offset="7442265">In its decision, the Commission set a minimum rate of 9 cents subject of course to quality deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.361" offset="7476851">And they based this minimum rate upon this Court's decision in the Sierra Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.677" offset="7498062">Now the Sierra Case and the Case of Mobil which I have just discussed in moratorium are both decided the same day by this Court, February the 27th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.737" offset="7546337">Now, it is Mobil's contention that the Commission was correct in including a minimum rate in the rate designed to the area method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.978" offset="7575280">And it's such a decision is just and reasonable, but Mobil contends that the 9 cent level is too low and cannot be supported by the Commission rather the minimum should be placed at a level which would allow recovery of the revenue requirements which the Commission has established for the Permian area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.294" offset="7652498">Now, there can be no doubt about it that the Commission in following the mandate of this Court in Phillips 2, has set 16.5 for new gas and 14.5 for old gas as the revenue requirements for the industry collectively in the Permian area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.996" offset="7731388">Now, having gone this far, it is Mobil's contention that rate should be designed which will allow the recovery of these revenue requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.014" offset="8403466">If I might now turn to quick -- a quick word as to the rate of return and I only wish to say very briefly that the Commission purported to allow a 12% rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.059" offset="8451636">However, in their brief to this Court, page 141, we now find that the Commission says that the rate of return was only to be allowed on gas of pipeline quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.228" offset="8504299">And that in actuality, the rate is something like 10 and three-fourths on new gas, and 9% on flowing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.945" offset="8547140">Now this comes as a better shock to those people who have studied the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.818" offset="8574621">In the record, page 606 (d), the Commission's decision, it stated that the rate of return is to be allowed on the production activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.545" offset="8613595">And there's no mention there of gas of pipeline quality or anything of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.029" offset="8631463">So, most of the position is that if the impact of the quality deductions are going to reduce the rate of return down to 10 and three-fourths than 9, then perhaps the Commission should again raise the stated rate of return to 14 or 13 and a half to allow the actual recovery of a 12% rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2245.132" offset="9083904">And that this consideration is to be in the form of rate that permit the individual to recover as a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.656" offset="9117968">It cost the service made up of its operating expenses and capital charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.437" offset="9141164">This however does not mean that separate findings need be made as to each individual in a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.835" offset="9178676">Instead, individual rights maybe reconciled with those of the group in a cost method of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.166" offset="9220054">By use of evidence that is typical and representative of the individuals in the group and by providing for an effective and viable savings cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.473" offset="9281285">The Federal Power Commission in its Permian opinion however, has neither recognized nor applied these principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.398" offset="9312946">And for this reason we say that its action should be reversed in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.438" offset="9337083">In the time I have available, I want to make four points in support of this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.535" offset="9361533">I shall try to avoid repetition but sometimes in order to make a complete presentation might be necessary to what appears would be repetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.568" offset="9401657">First, it is fundamental that the Federal Power Commission must consider the effect the rates fixed on the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.163" offset="9436035">The individual producers have very extensive investments and constitutionally, these investments will be confiscated by inadequate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.379" offset="9480861">This was the holding of this Court in the Tag Brothers in the market agency cases in which they distinguished the need for confiscation in a utility type case as opposed to this market agency type case where there was no investment, it was just simply the operating expenses we're involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.324" offset="9564662">Also the individual has a continuing obligation to sell and it is not free to terminate by reason of the aban -- by reason of the abandonment section of the Act as interpreted by this Court and as applied by this -- by the Federal Power Commission on a number of cases as cited in our brief contrary to the statements of Mr. Solomon to which I would say would've given the impression that the Commission just simply let's people out of their contracts and out of their obligation to sell at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.590" offset="9705723">Now in addition, the Natural Gas Act is predicated on the commerce power and not the war power as was the case of group ratemaking under war pri -- war time price control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.701" offset="9754206">From a statutory standpoint the underlying rights of the individual are indicated by the plain words of the statute, by a contrast with this statute, with statutes that were advisably designed for group ratemaking such as the Interstate Commerce Act and the transport -- and the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 which was virtually contemporaneously the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.081" offset="9871653">In addition as has been mentioned, this Court in Bowles v. Willingham recognized that under the Act, the rates that fixed must be just and reasonable as to particular person's incompetence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.863" offset="9918777">We now come to my second point which is the consideration that must be given to the individual is that as a minimum, it must be provided rates which will afford the opportunity to recover its operating expenses and capital charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.260" offset="9992443">This assumes of course that those cost are prudent and that the resulting rates are within competitive limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.795" offset="10026506">In the instant case however, there is no evidence of imprudency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.053" offset="10039568">In fact the question was put to any number of staff witnesses, the Commission staff witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.808" offset="10650624">This Commission in Opinion 468 said, it is but -- beyond disputed that continuing exploration and development of new gas reserves is necessary in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.547" offset="10697540">We cite that on page 70 of our brief further, the Fifth Circuit in Forest Oil Company said that dry hole expenses are unavoidable elements of exploration and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.161" offset="10760025">Now we say that therein lies the rule as for the allowance of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.875" offset="10778833">Now let's take this situation that Mr. Furbush brought out where you find a 138% of your reserves in one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.653" offset="10809971">Now what happen sometimes is the company might drill for three or four years before it finds something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.908" offset="10835048">Then it finds a good find, it dedicates it to the public interest in that one year by signing a 20 year pipe -- contract with a pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.769" offset="10886457">Now we say that you shouldn't limit your company to just replacing its reserves.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.630" offset="11237857">What that would show is that on Sun's views of it's operating expenses and capital charges the rates provided will not permit it to recover those operating expenses and capital charges hence it would be confiscatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.362" offset="11292818">Now, let me say this as long as you brought the subject up, that we believed that in the first instance there are two criteria for this group ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.416" offset="11340988">In the first instance, the Commission had to find that the evidence it used was typical and representative of the individuals in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.132" offset="11379858">Now this is just a straight regulatory law of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.844" offset="11394800">This Court has applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.959" offset="11399189">It approved it last term in the Chicago and Northwestern case for the fixing of group divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.138" offset="11427924">There have been other cases where the Court has recognized the identity of the individual and the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.450" offset="11453210">Now we say that's the proper test that was kept along and represented as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.479" offset="11473272">The Commission didn't do that and on that basis alone, we say it should be reversed as this Court reversed the ICC in the Orient Case, the U.S. v. Abilene, Southern at 265 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.987" offset="11535339">However, there is the second element that if the Commission had found properly that it had typical and representative evidence, the second element to our presentation or to the fundamentals to group ratemaking under this statute is providing a viable and effective savings cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.810" offset="11630634">And we say one of the elements of the savings cost is permitting an individual company to show that it would be confiscated by the rates that are being fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.128" offset="11675878">And when I say confiscated, I mean confiscation on an overall basis because this Court has found that confiscation is an overall company concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.574" offset="11737631">Now from what I have stated, we say that there is no evidence that any cost were imprudent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.274" offset="11772426">There is no basis for Mr. Solomon to seek to equate a producer whose cost exceed the average as being some way imprudent hence the Commission takes the view that you can just simply ignore their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.575" offset="11841703">And Mr. Furbush yesterday said it doesn't make any difference if they go bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.630" offset="11861870">We say that the producers are not strangers to bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.002" offset="11879424">And that many producers have gone bankrupt by the normal forces of competition, their ability to find gas, their ability to sell the gas, and that's one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.070" offset="11923623">But when they go bankrupt because the Federal Power Commission fixed a rate which refuse to consider their individual costs and reduce their revenues and for that reason they go bankrupt, we say this is confiscation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.211" offset="11996244">We say that this minimum of operating expenses from capital charges has been held by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.565" offset="12025605">The Commission says however it needs only balance in consumer and investor interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.818" offset="12054653">However, if you re -- and may cite for that Justice Black's concurrence in Natural Gas Pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.273" offset="12076492">But if you read that concurrence in full context and if you read the Hope Case, the Colorado Interstate Case, the statement is that imbalancing that interest, the minimum investor interest is its operating expenses in capital charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.436" offset="12149112">My third point is the need for identity between group and individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.334" offset="12180668">In U.S. v. Borden, a 1962 decision of this Court there was involved cost justification for price differentials under the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.162" offset="12224031">And the concurrence urged that the cost justification should be on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.313" offset="12244616">The majority however held that -- bound that it could be on a group basis if there was a “self saneness” of the individuals in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.466" offset="12289233">Now we say this principle is the same thing the ICC has applied in its division's cases and in its group ratemaking cases where it used typical and representative evidence and provided the savings cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.894" offset="12370944">My fourth point was that the Commission had not give in effect or considered the typicality or representative a -- ness of the evidence or had prov -- had not provided any-- an adequate savings cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.635" offset="12433951">I have to skip over the details including some good answers I had to Mr. Solomon for some of his statements yesterday because I want to get to the question of the savings cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.024" offset="12483480">As I said, in the first place we say that the Commission, the typicality of the representativeness is the first criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.443" offset="12513155">The Commission has not found it and therefore it should be reversed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.907" offset="12531022">However, as to the savings cost, the Commission's view of a savings cost is apparently -- in the one instance it says that's unnecessary to its method of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.096" offset="12599777">On the other hand it refers to the savings cost throughout its brief as apparently a catchall to foster the impression that no matter the inequities of its method, sooner or later justice will be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.405" offset="12652962">The fact is however although the operation of savings cost is not to any extent explained, enough is said to show that the savings cost that the Commission proposes is nothing like the savings cost that this Court recognized as recently in its last term in the Chicago and Northwestern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.630" offset="12733942">In the first place, the Commission views the savings cost only as a matter to be heard at a distant future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.859" offset="12758810">And it even resists a stay pending that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.763" offset="12782425">On the other hand, the ICC makes the savings cost an intrical part of its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.054" offset="12811577">In fact, the argument was made in the Chicago and Northwestern case that a company had not made their savings cost presentation during the course of the hearing and therefore they were stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.794" offset="12870510">In further contrast, our Opinion 468 clearly states that the savings cost will not permit the individual to show that he is atypical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.747" offset="12914395">Also it will not permit the individual to show that he is being confiscated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.649" offset="12938010">Now Mr. Solomon referred to out of pocket expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.076" offset="12955669">Now out of pocket expenses are not the measure of confiscation because there wouldn't be included return, there wouldn't be included depreciation, there wouldn't be included overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.668" offset="12994017">It's just simply a question if you're ready to go out of business, you can't even make your out of pocket expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.748" offset="13022333">The distinction between out of pocket expenses and confiscation has also been defined by this Court in the B &amp; O Railroad case, 298 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.159" offset="13080012">So we say that the Commission has advisably said -- as it stated as we pointed out that it will not use confiscation as a measure of a savings cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.880" offset="13118882">Further, it has indicated by its moratorium that it won't consider changed facts and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.343" offset="13148766">And this is one of the other elements of its savings cost to permit the individual if he has changed facts and conditions to show them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carroll L. Gilliam</label>
            <text syncTime="3283.401" offset="13236955">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.817" offset="13258689">I and Mr. Stone who will follow me appear for 30 producer respondents in this case who are unique thus far before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.780" offset="13306441">We are the -- apparently the only parties here who asked the Court to do one simple thing and that is to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.469" offset="13349282">We are the parties within the producing industry who are not petitioners in this case and we are here as I said as respondents only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.016" offset="13391391">Mr. Stone who will follow me will discuss our view as to the refund issues and issues involving Section 4 (e) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.609" offset="13429844">I will cover the issues of rate design and the reasons why the Court of Appeals limited remand ordered in this case is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.570" offset="13469654">We believed that the limited remand is essential to have a lawful area rate method and to have valid rates in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.697" offset="13522108">I believe the Court will see that implicit in that statement is the fact that our group supports the Commission insofar as it has adopted the area rate method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.898" offset="13574980">We are not before the Court raising special circumstance type questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.794" offset="13602565">We are therefore somewhat unique and that we cannot endorse any of the arguments that had been made before the Court so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.043" offset="13635584">We find ourselves agreeing with the Commission on some things, agreeing with even the California distributors on the adequacy of supply questions, agreeing with our fellow producers in part and not in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.286" offset="13684485">So the safest thing I can say is that I must start my argument on a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.798" offset="13706533">I do have to return the attention of the Court however to the items and issues that were discussed yesterday and not today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.680" offset="13750105">Very briefly I would like to remind the Court as to what the Court of Appeals did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.171" offset="13776018">It did not reverse the Commission as to the legality of the use of group or area procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.317" offset="13804648">We agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.259" offset="13812381">It did not reverse the Commission as to the dual pricing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.056" offset="13835577">It did not reverse the Commission as to methods of data collection, means of determining group clause that were determined in the case for producers and apparently the means for determining revenue requirements for the producing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.132" offset="13907884">What the Court of Appeals has done is to accept the Commission's cost yardstick but to tell the Commission that having selected that yardstick the Commission should use it when it designs the rates that are applicable to the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.448" offset="13981132">Now this brings us to what are the patent errors in the Commission opinion that compelled this result in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.955" offset="14015195">First of all, the Court of Appeals referred to this question as to possibly the most important in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.848" offset="14042781">It is the question that if area rates are valid under this statute what is the substantive standard as to what is a lawful and valid area rate on a group basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.706" offset="14102235">That of course is important in the Permian Basin in this case in the second round of any future Permian Basin case and it is the most critical issue here in relation to the four of the area rate cases that Mr. Solomon referred to yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.161" offset="14172035">If the standard being used to determine the rates on the group basis is a hodgepodge and complete confusion then those cases like all others will be endless in the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.615" offset="14237863">They will be endless in judicial review because no Court of Appeals will know what it is they're supposed to be reviewing when the case arrives there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.778" offset="14278510">The Court of Appeals solved this question by turning to this Court's prior construction of the standard in the Natural Gas Act principally in the Hope Case, the end result test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.053" offset="14343607">It was the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that even though the Commission had shifted to a group method using group data, the objectives still was to come out with just and reasonable rates to be applied to the group under that statutory standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.106" offset="14415809">Now, some questions have come up about the scope of review and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.192" offset="14436185">We believe the Court of Appeals correctly turned to Hope to find out what is the measure of judicial review in a rate case which this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.807" offset="14486549">Using that standard, the Court turned to look at what is the end result in this case in relation to what is said in Hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.333" offset="14528658">And here is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.985" offset="14539316">The end result in relation to the test in Hope is an unknown today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.018" offset="14567424">No one who has argued before this Court including the distinguished general counsel of the Commission can tell the Court that in what in the prescribed group rates is the return actually allowed or what clause have been covered, cushions or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.218" offset="14648195">The reason is that the rates on the record before this Court are unknowns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.008" offset="14671391">Now I had to go back to some of the tedious facts as to what the Commission did in order to demonstrate to the Court that that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.935" offset="14723114">A number of counsel have covered the steps the Commission used to collect data to composite cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.829" offset="14758640">We are not questioning in our argument those steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.613" offset="14781837">What they did though was give the Commission the ingredients to measure cost and currents and the financial requirements for the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.315" offset="14820603">Now, Mr. Solomon referred to the two types of cost determinations that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.160" offset="14847979">And I would make one blanket general statement about those that I don't think could be contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.176" offset="14872116">Every single step involved was a process of averaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.913" offset="14895000">They had questionnaires which we all answered and in fact we cooperated in this endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.697" offset="14922167">So let us just take as an example the overhead cost of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.540" offset="14945573">Each producer who filled out the questionnaire supplied the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.226" offset="14964276">On the other hand, the Commission also acquired unsifted volume data that is unsifted as to quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.907" offset="14998967">All of these things were totaled up, volumes are divided into cost and you thereby come out with an average cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.916" offset="15038986">This is part and parcel of the normal ingredients of a group type of rate regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.955" offset="15067199">The examiner in the case, I would point this out specifically because I will get back to the new gas cost, expressly labeled his new gas cost as the average unit cost at 1960 which was the test year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.443" offset="15145148">I would refer for those statements to the record, page 186 that is the joint appendix page 221 and 257.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.500" offset="15193422">But the product of this process of averaging was this Commission yardstick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.060" offset="15219649">Now, Mr. Atwell did cover it earlier and I won't go into that the fact that the yardstick was the cost to the wellhead only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.973" offset="15251310">It did not include producer incurred cost beyond that point which are cost incurred to bring gas up to a higher quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.113" offset="15291852">But accepting the wellhead cost figures, there are two of significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.620" offset="15317870">On the new gas cost 16.5 cents and the old gas cost 14.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.205" offset="15360188">The Commission then had these as the yardsticks to turn to measure against that yardstick the average revenues that the industry was then deriving at the contracts in effect under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.796" offset="15426539">The record showed that the test year average revenues and this is all gas regardless of age or quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.856" offset="15462797">The test year average revenue was 12.72 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.916" offset="15491009">This was an approximate collection of about a $110 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.314" offset="15512639">The rate structure that created that revenue consisted of prices that were originally contract that are now filed rate schedules under the Act ranging from as low as 3 cents per Mcf up to 18 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.760" offset="15590379">But this structure of contracts produced this average revenue figure of 12.72.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.072" offset="15619636">It is our view that at that point following the steps for testing and prescribing rates that this Court referred to in 1942 in the Natural Gas Pipeline case, the Commission should have then turned to test against its cost figure, the average cost figure, the revenues at existing rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.444" offset="15717125">The Commission however skipped these steps and went straight to the step of prescribing or designing a complete new structure of rates to replace these contracts in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.696" offset="15766131">And it is --</text>

            <text syncTime="4994.734" offset="20082291">In doing that and in reaching that conclusion, the Commission gave no consideration whatsoever to the revenues which were generated during this past period by virtue of the rates including the increases either to the industry as a group or as to any individual company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.757" offset="20190438">Nor did the Commission in reaching its conclusion on refunds on an individual contract by contract basis decide that anyone of those increases was unduly discriminatory or preferential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.782" offset="20258461">The Commission used as the sole basis for refunds the fact that the individual increase exceeded this ceiling price as further adjusted for quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.984" offset="20315303">So in essence, what the Commission did as we view it is to determine that each such increase above that ceiling rate was unlawful per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.374" offset="20380818">The Court of Appeals on rehearing differed with the Commission on that issue concluding that no refund obligation could be imposed for any portion of this past period in which there was a group revenue deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.400" offset="20484995">Before pointing out the principle reasons why we believe the Court of Appeals was right and the Federal Power Commission was in error, let me make as clear as I can what we are not claiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.406" offset="20560959">We are not claiming that the producers should be entitled to raise a single contract price we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.699" offset="20598157">We have never claimed that in this proceeding at any of its stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.067" offset="20619682">We do claim that during this past or refund period, when the refunds generated to the group are less than the revenue requirements of the cost found for that group by the Commission it is improper to order refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.978" offset="20711320">Now we do not say that some refunds might not be due in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.236" offset="20732322">We do say the Commission committed serious error in not giving any consideration to the revenue side of the ledger including the rates as increased but as I said made the refunds upon the mere premise that the individual increase happened to exceed its ceiling price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.201" offset="20836185">In the first place, we believe that when the Commission in an area proceeding adopts the group approach to determine the revenue requirements of the cost on a group basis consistency requires that that same group or unit be looked to on the revenue side of the ledger to see whether our rates including the increases produce too much or too little revenue.</text>

            <text syncTime="6519.770" offset="26182405">But if I may on the refund question we submit that this Court's decision in the second Philips case governs here on refunds because we think the situation here is as a legal matter in the same posture as was second Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.776" offset="26262444">Of course, here the regulated entity is not an individual company but a group of companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6546.665" offset="26290030">But in second Phillips they were dealing with a past period or a refund period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6552.187" offset="26312077">I think I understood the general counsel for the Commission yesterday to say that here we do not have a locked in period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6560.211" offset="26344260">Now, I don't want to get in to a discussion to this administrative terminology but the significant point here is, the Commission issued its order under Section 5 (a) of the law and it made that effective on September 1, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.180" offset="26408103">And it said this is the just and reasonable rate for all gas in the Permian Basin from and after this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="6584.842" offset="26442689">So these rate increase proceedings therefore and their rates was superseded as of that date by the Commission's order in the Section 5 (a) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.201" offset="26488142">So we are dealing here with a past or an impoundment period where the only question is that of refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6604.469" offset="26521266">And in second Phillips, we believe that the Commission held and this Court affirmed that rates well off the just and reasonable if you wish, though the Commission did not use those specific words, where during the past period, the revenues to Phillips were less than these revenue requirements even though some of the individual rates exceeded Phillips' revenue requirement of 12.16 cents in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6636.261" offset="26648430">That we submit is controlling here and the briefs they refer to the Tennessee Gas case, time will not commit my going into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6647.729" offset="26694301">I would refer, Your Honors, to our discussion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.599" offset="26705795">In our brief, Tennessee deals with zones, a rate that was concededly illegal whereas here that's a question and for the reasons I have stated and those in our brief we respectfully urged that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.</text>
