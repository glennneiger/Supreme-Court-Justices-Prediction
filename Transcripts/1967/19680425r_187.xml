            <text syncTime="43.052" offset="275623">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.480" offset="289311">Your Honors, this case involves the question whether the Menominee Indians still have the right to hunt and fish on their own land without regard to state bag limits, license fees and seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.793" offset="350542">We and the United States say that they are not subject to these regulations, contrary to the State of Wisconsin which says that they aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.214" offset="400280">I will first give you a little background about the Menominee Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.658" offset="422013">This tribe was discovered so to speak in 1634 by Father Nicolet.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.501" offset="453360">These Indians, who today number about 3200, live in Eastern Wisconsin where they always have lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.667" offset="490036">They originally occupy the very large section of Wisconsin about 12 million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.333" offset="516681">And through a series of sessions, they were reduced by 1854 to 230,000 acres which was remained the size of their reservation up to the present day, this country is forest and lake country.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.378" offset="584913">The Menominee Reservation is 95% forest land.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.127" offset="607901">Its good quality forest land aboriginally and up until the time of the treaties and today.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.242" offset="648338">They have hunted and fished.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.901" offset="655026">This is an excellent hunting and fishing country and also trapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.240" offset="672371">The reservation abounds with deer, with trout and with poultries such as muskrat and beaver.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Hobbs</label>
            <text syncTime="157.027" offset="731512">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.779" offset="738513">Generally speaking, this tribe has enjoyed peaceful relations with United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.247" offset="756381">They are not one of the hostile tribes with which United States have to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.315" offset="784593">As of 1954, which is the key or it was the beginning of the termination stage of this case, they have about 3200 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.928" offset="827120">The reservation as I said consisted of about 230,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.336" offset="848750">On this reservation was a mill which belonged to the Menominee Tribe on the basis that United States held it in trust for the Menominee Tribe just as it held the reservation in trust for the Menominee Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.608" offset="905801">This mill processed the products of the forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.354" offset="920743">It logged the timber and then cut it into lumber and marketed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.175" offset="940074">A number of Menominee's several hundred, worked at this mill and those who did their average income is about $2300.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.934" offset="979153">For those who did not, their average income was about $650.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.671" offset="1002036">The tribe owned a trust fund held by the United States in trust has about $9.5 million as of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.388" offset="1036936">This money, most of it arose from a judgment against United States for mismanagement of the tribe's timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.386" offset="1068910">The Court acclaims after a long trial held that there had been mismanagement and that the damages were $8.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.351" offset="1108825">And this tribe up until 1954 like most other Indian tribes was under federal supervision or federal guardianship as it is sometimes called.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.684" offset="1154069">Unlike most tribes, this tribe paid for that guardianship.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.397" offset="1169011">Most of the federal services that came to the tribe, the tribe paid for because it had the money to do so, thanks to its mill and later its judgment fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.596" offset="1213733">Now, I will now go back to the treaty under which we claim our hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.576" offset="1257723">In a two-step transaction in 1848 and 1854, the Menominees first seeded all of their land in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.394" offset="1296906">The idea was if they're going to move to the Red Wing reservation in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.553" offset="1317595">But it was understood at least by the Menominees and I think generally understood that they're going to take a look at the Red Wing reservation and see whether they liked it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.097" offset="1359809">Yes they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.837" offset="1362735">An exploration party went to the Minnesota reservation, inspected it and came back with stories that the hunting and fishing was no good there.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.542" offset="1397530">So the United States and the tribe refused to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.672" offset="1410069">So the United States suggested another location for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.479" offset="1425324">This time the Wolf River reservation which was just north of where they were then camping.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.300" offset="1452596">The Menominees inspected that and they notice that the hunting and fishing was excellent.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.886" offset="1470882">They so stated and agreed to take it and that's what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.191" offset="1484152">They moved to the Wolf River reservation which is a little north of where they were then camping.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.513" offset="1521455">Later, the State -- that was in 1852.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.417" offset="1537024">In 1853, the State of Wisconsin consented to the setting aside of the Wolf River reservation and in 1854, we come to the treaty which is the basis of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.125" offset="1583835">The 1854 Treaty confirmed these events that I've just finished describing.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.928" offset="1607032">The tribe retroceded its interest in the Red Wing reservation and acquired its interest in the Wolf River reservation and that reservation was given to them under the following language, to be held as a -- for a home to be held as Indian lands are held.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.284" offset="1680488">Now that is the language under which we say we have acquired hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.668" offset="1702013">This protected the Indian's aboriginal customs to hunt and fish in accordance with their way of life.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Hobbs</label>
            <text syncTime="442.672" offset="1874108">Now, until this case arose in 1954, no one question these rights to hunt and fish for the state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.616" offset="1909844">But in 1954, the Congress passed an Act which terminated the federal supervision to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.632" offset="1941922">And in general terms, it made the state laws applicable to this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.896" offset="1962924">The 1954 Act said nothing about exempting the hunting and fishing rights for the state regulation but during the course of the Bill in Congress, the joint committee was told by the drafter of the Bill, the Department of Interior, that this Bill would not abrogate or affect any treaty rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.539" offset="2041501">Further, when the Bill was signed by President Eisenhower, the father of the bill, Senator Watkins announced proudly that this Bill, "The Bill in no way violates any treaty obligation with this tribe."</text>
            <text syncTime="500.505" offset="2105344">In spite of these assurances as we will see, Wisconsin claims that the rights have been abrogated by this 1954 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.640" offset="2137945">The 1954 Act gave the Menominees a period of time in which to adjust to the new conditions to make arrangements with the State with the new services which would be required and generally to transition from being under federal supervision to being on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.315" offset="2208684">And it was not until 1961 that the Termination Act finally became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.835" offset="2234702">The termination plan which was finally made effective in 1961 was as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.895" offset="2258944">Prior to termination, the tribe governed itself, subject to general and federal supervision.The major tribal asset as I said was the Menominee forest and the mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.375" offset="2312861">And they also have this large cash trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.845" offset="2330728">The other assets -- other tribe were tangible personal property associated with milling operation such as their lumber inventory or milling equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.463" offset="2381197">And they had an additional asset which was their treaty hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.618" offset="2405857">Now all of these assets except the hunting and fishing rights were owned by the United States entrust for the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.719" offset="2434278">The United States had the legal title to all of this property and the tribe had the beneficial title.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.391" offset="2456952">And the United States kept careful accounts of all these trust property and this excluded as I say the hunting and fishing rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.270" offset="2504495">Number one, the essential nature of this right is freedom from outside restriction and interference for the United States to be -- to have a guardian's possession of it is inconsistent with the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.615" offset="2573876">It was a treaty protected conduct, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.217" offset="2596237">Number two, the United States kept track of all the property that it own for the tribe and this right did not appear on any of the ledgers or accounts that the United States kept.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.788" offset="2662484">For -- as we will see, all of the trust property was conveyed to the Menominee Corporation which I'll come to and I therefore will argue that this not being trust property was not conveyed and remained in the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.554" offset="2721625">Now with respect to the tribal property which was predominantly the forest and the mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.413" offset="2749001">The tribe decided that it would set up a private corporation, a business corporation under the laws of Wisconsin to own the land and the mill and to operate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.232" offset="2796335">It was felt that this would be the most efficient way to continue the business of logging and milling the lumber.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.280" offset="2820472">The profits would flow to the members of the tribe by making them stockholders of this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.329" offset="2852655">With respect to the tribal governmental powers, the plan was to make the reservation a county under the organic laws of Wisconsin and the county would govern itself subject to state supremacy just like any other county of Wisconsin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.400" offset="5584959">Our clients, the Indians, would very clearly prefer to have the hunting and fishing rights than any compensation likely to be awarded for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.245" offset="5620381">But as an alternative, if they are not entitled to the first prize, then they want the consolation prize, which is compensation for the loss, and they do make that as an alternative position here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.328" offset="5684642">I have four simple points to make on oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.002" offset="5703346">Number one, the tribe acquired a treaty protected right to hunt and fish free of state regulation as of the -- as of the 1854 Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.859" offset="5750784">Number two, the 1954 Termination Act did not cut off this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.992" offset="5779310">Number three, the 1954 Act did not terminate the existence of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.652" offset="5801984">And number four, ergo, the tribe still owns the right today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.867" offset="5826853">Point number one, the 1854 Treaty guaranteed the tribe's hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.653" offset="5849945">This of course is basic to our case and it is a point which has been accepted by every Court which has addressed it and by two Oregon Courts which have addressed a very similar question with respect to the Klamath Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.431" offset="5905115">It's fully briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.974" offset="5911280">I don't intend to dwell on it, but I'll briefly cover the bases of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.666" offset="5938030">The Court of Claims in an earlier Menominee case, in my brief, blue brief at page six, I quote the Court of Claims' findings in this earlier 1942 Menominee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.806" offset="6010546">The Court of Claims found as follows,"The bases, the background, the previous history, and the negotiations leading up to the 1854 Treaty show that the Indians were desirous of securing hunting lands and that the swamp lands were particularly suited for this purpose being filled with all kinds of game."</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.501" offset="6097377">Also, part of the inducement for the moving of the Indians from their former home to their new home, and one of the reasons for entering into the new treaty was the fact that the track in question contains swamp lands which were suitable for hunting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.385" offset="6152861">What I'm saying is there was an expressed understanding here between the Indians and the United States that they were to -- that hunting and fishing was important to these Indians and they were to have this right unrestricted when they moved on to their new reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.022" offset="6207509">This understanding did not appear in the treaty but it was the same as if it had because of the expressed understanding of the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.345" offset="6972792">But point number two, the 1954 Termination Act did not cut off the treaty rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.991" offset="7067355">Number two, the father of the Bill, Senator Watkins, announced on the signing of the Bill that this Bill did not violate any treaty rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.335" offset="7104763">Number three, the final termination plan incorporated as part of itself Public Law 280, which was a general Act of Congress extending state laws on to reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.885" offset="7166934">And Public Law 280 expressly preserves hunting and fishing rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.869" offset="7234853">And finally, the settled law of construction is that treaty rights, Indian treaty rights will not be deemed to be abrogated by implication unless absolutely required by an inconsistent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.281" offset="7296502">The -- as I say, the Wisconsin Trial Court held that the rights survived the Termination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.197" offset="7328162">The U.S. District Court and this local state court in Oregon held that the Klamath rights survived the Klamath Termination Act and the dissent in the Wisconsin Appeals Court, the Court of -- Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the rights survived the act and still exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.475" offset="8785272">And the legal position of the State of Wisconsin is fully set forth in the briefs, and I won't go into it in great detail, but so that the Court is absolutely clear, I would refer to it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.845" offset="8842742">First of all, Wisconsin contends that the hunting and fishing rights of the Menominee Tribe were acquired under the Treaty of 1854.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.294" offset="8892583">We contend that these rights were cut off by the 1954 Menominee Termination Act and the events which have taken place subsequent to and pursuant to that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.076" offset="8963636">And we further contend that the cutting off of these viable rights was an act for which compensation is due and owing the Menominee Indians by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.501" offset="9025390">First of all, the plain language of the Termination Act itself in our view events as an intent to end the tribal status of the Menominee Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.559" offset="9081605">By looking at the very words of the Act itself, the language is clear in Section 899.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.155" offset="9124028">It says that the Menominees will not be entitled to any of the services performed by the United States for Indians because of their status as Indians and further, that the laws of the several states shall apply in the same manner as to other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.655" offset="9205948">We can glean an indication of the intent of Congress in passing these Termination Acts by the House Concurrent Congressional Resolution 108 which says that the purpose of termination is to make Indians subject to the same laws as other citizens and assume full responsibility as citizens, and to turn over the Federal Government's trusteeship to a responsible Indian people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.403" offset="9324962">The Menominee Termination Act is silent as to the question of hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.239" offset="9364355">In our view, the legislative history, which is cited by the petitioner at the very best is inconclusive on this point and certainly does not support the contention of a peti -- of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.920" offset="9419003">First of all, as to the testimony that was presented to the committee which consider -- was considering, the Termina -- the Menominee Termination Act, the tribe's own attorney, Mr. Wilkinson on this very point testified that the passage of the Act in its --in the form then being considered by the Congress would have the effect of cutting off the Indians' hunting and fishing rights, and this is set forth fully in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.571" offset="9537703">Furthermore, this was not the only version of the Termination Act which was before the Congress at this particular time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.222" offset="9896312">And -- but -- but Congress, in view of this conflicting testimony and this specific testimony of the counsel for the tribe that the version that finally passed which was silent would have the effect of cutting off hunting and fishing rights, chose to pass the silent version.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.439" offset="9969142">And we contend that at best, the legislative history is inconclusive and all it shows is that Congress had two versions before it, one which specifically reserved the hunting and fishing rights, and the one which finally passed which was silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.187" offset="10044165">And therefore, the Congress passed the sil -- with -- with this testimony before the Congress passed the silent version.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.664" offset="10074049">And if anything, we contend that this supports our position that these rights were cut off because if they were to have any specific rights beyond ordinary citizenship, they should have been spelled out by the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.184" offset="11656129">I'd like to briefly conclude the State's discussion of the legal points that are in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.375" offset="11692910">The petitioners argue again based on legislative history in interpreting the Menominee Termination Act that Public Law 280, which conferred jurisdiction to the State of Wisconsin and over the Menominee Indians for purposes of civil and -- and criminal matters but contained a specific reservation of hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.551" offset="11841599">This law became law about a month after the Menominee Termination Act was passed and the petitioners contend that this was -- that the concurrent consideration by the same Congress of these two acts made it unnecessary to specifically reserve hunting and fishing rights when it passed the Menominee Termination Act because it was contained in Public Law 280, which was passed by the same Congress a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.519" offset="11969494">I would merely say in response to the argument, which -- which is in our position set forth more fully in the briefs, is that in the volumes and volumes of testimony that pertained to all the termination acts that were considered at the same time, there was not one single reference to Public Law 280, and the only reference to Public Law 280 in so far as the Menominee Indians are concerned comes about some seven years later in the language of the plan which was drafted by the -- and submitted by the Indians pursuant to the original act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.743" offset="12134379">And certainly, something which take place -- takes place seven years later cannot possibly be considered as part of the legislative history on the original termination act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.861" offset="12182862">And furthermore on this point, I would like to bring the Court's attention to the fact that the original State Supreme Court decision was handed down in 1963, the Sanapaw case which held at the Termination Act did cut off the hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.451" offset="12281187">That following the decision our State Supreme Court in the Sanapaw case, we had five years in which the Congress could have acted had it disagreed with the holding of the Court in the Sanapaw case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.151" offset="12343986">And in fact, the Menominee Termination Act was amended by the Congress in 1966 and there was no effort by the Congress made at that time to overrule the decision of the State Supreme Court in the Sanapaw Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.978" offset="12411277">This point is not covered in our brief and I bring it to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.028" offset="12427473">As an additional argument, which supports the position of the State of Wisconsin, that the Sanapaw decision was concurred in by silence, by Congress, and the only inference that can be gained if any from that silence is that they concurred in the decision of our Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.942" offset="12643140">We also contend, and it's set forth fully in our brief, that petitioners rely on Klamath cases is misplaced, and that in fact, the Klamath case supports the position of the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.081" offset="12707715">First of all, I think we have to distinguish the Klamath case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.697" offset="12726209">The case had an entirely different termination act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.390" offset="12740942">There, the Indians were given an option of either remaining on the tribe, on the reservation as a continuing member of a -- of the tribe, or to terminate and they had an actual election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.401" offset="12801024">Those who voted to terminate, the land was sold and actual moneys were paid to those who elected to terminate, some $40,000.00 a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.225" offset="12848253">Those who elected to remain on the reservation the proportionate amount of land was continued as a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.082" offset="12887751">The question before the Court in that case was whether or not the Klamath tribe, those members of the tribe who elected to remain on the reservation, whether their rights to hunt on the land that was formerly on the Klamath Reservation but had been sold and put in trust and became a national forest, whether their hunting rights acquired under their treaty survived this termination and this transfer on the old lands that were on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.600" offset="13037798">The Court held no, they didn't survive and that even though they were given under a treaty, they didn't survive the transfer in that particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.922" offset="13275094">And first of all, I think that considering this case, we have to -- and in considering the prior cases that dealt with this question and the legislative history, you have to realize that the Menominee Indian Treaty is different from any other treaty that is raised in the cases that are cited in any of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.196" offset="13376136">And first of all, it's different because it is a grant from the United States and not a ceding by the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.312" offset="13436635">In other words, this is new land that was given to the Menominee Tribe that they had not had any aboriginal claim of title to or of right to or of any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.952" offset="13479163">And therefore, when the Court -- when the treaty was entered into and which it declared that these are to be -- these lands are given to the Indians as a home to be held as Indian lands are held, this was a grant to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.091" offset="13555754">And in the other treaties wherein the land was their aboriginal land and the treaty was entered into, there was always the reasoning going through the decisions that the treaty rights were a session from the Indians of -- of rights that they already have and a reservation of those rights that were not mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.396" offset="13816978">Wherever there was silence in so far as the treaty itself was concerned on these points that it was understood by the Indians that they always had these rights and therefore, there was no need to mention them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.668" offset="13870059">And it was not a granting away of any rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.903" offset="13878941">It was a reservation of those rights which were not specifically mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.106" offset="14279764">Not on -- not only are the lands no longer held as Indian lands are held in this particular case, but the Indians no longer live as a tribe -- as a tribe of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.301" offset="14348622">For over a hundred years prior to termination, the Menominees lived under tribal government supplemented by the federal agency supervision.</text>

            <text syncTime="4780.065" offset="19223594">I say that the Court in one sense need not reach the question whether any rights were conveyed if it concludes that the Termination Act did not affect whatever rights, if any were conveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.396" offset="19272913">It is, however, our position in order to try to be helpful to the Court and in the peculiar situation of the conflict between the Court of Claims and the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and the dilemma that leaves the petitioners in, we have addressed ourselves to the other issues and I tend to speak to them now in -- in chronological order that is first as to our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.578" offset="19381687">The advisory, as it may be, is to -- what rights were originally conveyed were originally conveyed in 1854.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.445" offset="19409168">Many thought it appropriate distressed that the outset of this question in one sense is not necessary to reach.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="4840.754" offset="19466428">I suppose if the Court decided the other way, it wouldn't be necessary for us to reach either if we held that the Termination Act did destroy treaty rights if any and then -- and the Court of Claims decide whether there were any and if so, what they were and finally, what was their value.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="4861.323" offset="19548662">Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, the Court of Claims has decided that there were treaty rights and if this Court should decide now that whatever rights were granted have been destroyed, I suppose it would then have to reach the question whether that impose by the Colony of United States though for that last question, I should think there ought to be a remand since the Court of Claims did not address itself to that viewing the Termination Act as having taken nothing away from the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.187" offset="19688155">In our view, the Treaty of Wolf River, when it ceded these lands to the Indians to be held as Indian lands are held, in all the circumstances which have been fully recited by the petitioners may fairly be read to have intended to give to these Indians the same rights that they would have had in this land and once did have in this land if it had always been theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.838" offset="19798706">That is as though this provision had read to be held as Indian lands are held, that is to say with the right to take the wildlife thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.009" offset="19859414">In other words, we view the so-called hunting and fishing rights as an aspect of the right to own or possess these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.111" offset="19895777">We view it as tied to the right to own or posses these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.529" offset="19917511">We view it as ending when the ownership or possession of the land is no longer in the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.619" offset="19953873">On the other hand, we think that the right granted, however, pertinent to the land it may be, however, tied to the land it may be is very much more than a normal landowner's right with respect to fishing and hunting on its own land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.510" offset="20025448">In the first place, it is a right unlike the privilege susceptible of being wholly or partly destroyed which an ordinary landowner has with respect to hunting and fishing on his lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.242" offset="20092322">The State can forbid him from taking the wildlife of his own land and conservation laws do often do precisely that or they can limit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.487" offset="20149269">Also, we suppose that this right have been granted by the United States or it is guaranteed by the United States in a federal treaty cannot be taxed by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.949" offset="20191169">In that respect also, there is something more than a normal landowner's right with respect to game and fish on his land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.071" offset="20223666">And finally, to the extent that the normal landowner would not be able to exclude others from these lands at least those lands which border on navigable rivers or the rivers themselves, these Indians have a special right because they have an exclusive right to exclude all others and cannot be made to share their resource with the other citizens of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="5836.759" offset="23450415">As I say, the Federal Government as guardian of the Indians had certain rights of regulation with respect to tribal property including hunting and fishing rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="5869.272" offset="23580505">And likewise, the Federal Government had the duty and the power to protect others against destruction by Indians of the resource that was not wholly theirs and so as to migratory fish or fowl, the United States could and we think that the State can, make sure that the Indians do not take more than their fair share of this migratory resource but as to that resource which is native to the reservation, it seems to us that the only regulation that is proper is a regulation for the benefit of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.601" offset="23733791">They well be that the State of Wisconsin has no interest in regulating the game on -- in Menominee County for the benefit of Indians in which event, it is of course free to let the Indians regulate it themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="6911.113" offset="27747871">Let me say a word about what is most central to this case which is the effect of the Termination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.059" offset="27791653">I will simply summarize the reasons, most of which have already been spoken here, why in our view, it is perfectly clear that the Termination Act have no intent to abrogate whatever hunting and fishing rights had been granted by the Treaty of 1854.</text>
            <text syncTime="6941.782" offset="27870542">In the first place, of course, it is against the normal presumption that the Congress would repudiate the solemn treaty it had made with the Indians and especially that it would do so, we're in complete silence and without making any provision for adequate compensation for the taking of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6961.103" offset="27947760">We surely know the presumption that Congress was not about such unfortunate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6970.513" offset="27985377">Now the -- it is true that the treaty -- that the Termination Act says that federal law shall no longer apply and that state laws shall apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="6981.495" offset="28029367">I point out to the Court that that language is uniform in the ten Termination Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6988.845" offset="28058728">This was the first Termination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.040" offset="28067506">It was very badly written and there are more careful provisions when inserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6997.547" offset="28093524">The same language appears in the Klamath Termination Act where it has been held that first, the fishing rights which are expressly preserved were of course not taken but also the hunting rights which are nowhere mentioned is preserved will also survive termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="7018.619" offset="28177847">Now, relevant to the particular legislative history of this Act is the statement of two witnesses from the Interior Department, one of them is the Assistant Secretary who were the drafters of this law and who assured the committee that the Termination Act even though it did not expressly preserved hunting and fishing rights would not touch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7042.648" offset="28273977">It is reasonable to assume that the Congressional Committees and the Congress as a whole listen to that advise and felt that they were not by this Act interfering with whatever hunting and fishing to Menominees had previously enjoyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7059.343" offset="28340746">This is further indicated by the fact that at the same con -- at the same Congress, at the same session, the Congress when generally providing for the application of state laws within Indian country had said, "All criminal laws shall apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="7088.967" offset="28459238">The Congress will be doing that on one hand and here to be letting the Menominee hunting and fishing rights go by the board in silence seems they're all are extraordinary things to assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="7102.237" offset="28512319">I finally, as I think Mr. Justice White was pointing out a moment ago, the Termination Act itself says, that that the plan which is to be submitted by the Indians shall contain provision for the wildlife, safety and protection of the wildlife and fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="7122.400" offset="28592985">Now, that would seem wholly unnecessary if the state fishing game laws were going to be fully applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7127.521" offset="28613465">Why should the Indians be making provision to preserve this asset of theirs?</text>
            <text syncTime="7133.968" offset="28639274">And finally, the exposure of the Government to monetary damages, if treaty rights were being taken or would suggest that the Congress did not mean to produce that result at the very time when it was concerned about relieving the Government of its financial obligation to the Indians resulting from the various services which had been provided in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="7164.894" offset="28762990">There is nothing inherently inconsistent about termination of federal supervision and continuance of treaty rights on the one hand and survival of the tribe on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="7185.237" offset="28844283">What was terminated were both powers and the duties of the United States Government vis-à-vis the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="7192.882" offset="28874898">But the Indians' existence as a tribe does not -- it has depended on the United States as their guardian.</text>
            <text syncTime="7205.209" offset="28924217">And these treaty rights of course can exist, can be respected by the state and can be enforced by the Federal Government if necessary without there being any federal guardianship over these Indians just as the off reservation treaty rights which were discussed in the case last session, exists quite independently of any federal supervision over those Indians or for that matter any federal jurisdiction over the accustomed hunting and fishing places.</text>

            <text syncTime="8065.646" offset="32366007">I think there have been misunderstandings.</text>
            <text syncTime="8068.445" offset="32377187">To my knowledge, the Menominee Termination Act was not amended in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="8073.274" offset="32396518">I think that Mr. LaFollette may have in mind an appropriation by Congress of money for the benefit of this reservation which was suffering terribly but I do not believe this was considered an amendment of the Termination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8089.422" offset="32461093">There's a possibility that I'm wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="8090.715" offset="32466213">I don't think it was an amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8092.989" offset="32475303">To my knowledge, the last amendment was in 1960 which was four months before the final deadline for termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="8099.854" offset="32502784">And if anyone is interested in the attitude of Congress toward this termination, I commend them to the hearings in this final act, the final amendment to the Menominee Termination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8111.239" offset="32548342">The record is clear beyond any question that termination was going to come and a matter of months whether the Indians were ready or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="8120.540" offset="32585540">The Secretary of Interior was authorized to go ahead and finish up the termination if the Indian didn't provide their own Menominee Enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="8129.127" offset="32619917">The Acts is going to fall without any further regard to the desires of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="8134.097" offset="32639770">As it happened, the Indians did meet the final deadline.But if they hadn't, the termination would have occurred anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="8141.917" offset="32671013">In the Klamath Treaty, there it was mentioned that there they had a specific reservation of their hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="8148.085" offset="32695672">I think Mr. Claiborne made a point that I will repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8151.081" offset="32707688">The Klamath case involved only a specific preservation of fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="8156.113" offset="32727855">The hunting rights, which is what all the litigation was about was never mentioned on the treaty or in the Termination Act and thus making those cases quite comfortable to ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="8167.968" offset="32775293">The -- there -- it was said that there are 400 homesteads that had been conveyed by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8177.455" offset="32813223">While these homesteads are residential lots and the total is probably less than 400 acres and 1% of the reservation would be 2300 acres so it looks like we're dealing with less than a fourth of 1% of the reservation here that is now in the Indian's ownership as residential lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="8198.287" offset="32896502">The Mason v. Sams case which the government counsel couldn't understand why it had been adhered to all these years was decided in 1925 and not 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="8210.134" offset="32943940">The Bureau of Indian Affairs has honored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8212.907" offset="32955016">Their -- for example in the case of the Quinault Tribe, the Quinault Tribe sells fishing licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="8219.784" offset="32982497">Well, the United States Government permits the tribe or at least doesn't say anything about it to keep this money on a non-trust account.</text>
            <text syncTime="8227.806" offset="33014575">In other words, there's further evidence that hunting and fishing rights are a particularly close matter for the tribe to govern themselves and not part of the trust property.</text>
            <text syncTime="8240.406" offset="33065044">As for the just compensability, I would call your attention to the fact that the Congress paid the Yakima Indians, and (Inaudible) and others, $27 million for the loss of some fishing stations as a result of dam built on Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="8255.376" offset="33124916">Again, they paid the Shoshone $75,000.00 for the loss of their hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="8261.142" offset="33147904">All of these are covered in our brief under the subject of compensability of the rights.</text>
