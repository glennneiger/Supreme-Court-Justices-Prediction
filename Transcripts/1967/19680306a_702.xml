            <text syncTime="27.954" offset="215228">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.521" offset="229439">This case comes here on certiorari to review a judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.262" offset="264443">By that judgment, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which imposed the death penalty on Ronald Johnson, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.511" offset="317419">The trial court imposed the death penalty following Johnson's conviction by a jury of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.926" offset="363081">The issues which this case brings here arise out of the use at trial of a question and answer statement amounting to a confession which was used over objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.895" offset="438941">Those issues -- first, as to whether on the facts which are undisputed that confession could've been determined to be voluntary or conversely must be declared to be involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.541" offset="517517">And the other issues which arise with respect to that confession, I would respect to the procedures used by the Massachusetts Courts with respect to that confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.212" offset="588257">Addressing myself first to the first issue I mentioned, the facts which are undisputed are as follows: the petitioner Johnson was taken into custody at approximately 9:30 PM on the evening of August 1st, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.373" offset="708838">Immediately prior to his being taken into custody he had been the object of a pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.272" offset="740498">The shooting for which he was subsequently indicted had occurred at approximately 9:00 PM of that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.213" offset="776234">Johnson was pursued in the car which he was driving by several -- by succession indeed of police vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.106" offset="815835">And the car he was driving was then in a collision with a bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.937" offset="843107">Johnson emerged from that car on foot and after a relatively brief foot pursuit he was apprehended under a porch and brought by policemen to a police box and that's in a police car to the local station house in the District of Boston known as Roxbury.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.470" offset="953240">There, Johnson was booked and he was booked amid circumstances which the trial judge found were attended by confusion, turmoil and strain.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.245" offset="1012381">He was plainly injured at the time, there's no question that he was bleeding on the head and around the neck at the time he was booked.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.474" offset="1101302">He -- there was a collision with a bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.743" offset="1118333">He emerged from the car which was badly damaged, no question to that, but I don't know as to -- I make no contention either way on this, I -- but I don't know and I don't think it was clear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.333" offset="1192730">It merely was perfectly clear that he was bleeding and was injured at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.535" offset="1217494">He was placed in a cell and he was given some first aid, this at the local station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.056" offset="1247587">And at the local station house occurred the first of several confrontations.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.337" offset="1280711">Oh, the record is not entirely clear on this but it would've been inevitable between 9 -- he was booked at 9:35.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.911" offset="1323029">He was taken into custody at 9:30; he was booked at 9:35 on suspicion of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.107" offset="1351764">He was taken down to the police headquarters which is five miles away, sometime around midnight, so that, the first of these confrontations, there maybe a record time on it but I'm not going to take the time to search it out, it was in this interlude.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.661" offset="1446013">A doctor and a -- the cut was cleaned off and a -- some -- a bandage put on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.613" offset="1489795">And then this confrontation was conducted by a Lieutenant Donovan who was the officer in-charged of these proceedings throughout the rest of the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.111" offset="1539845">And it consisted of being a -- Johnson being identified by a witness and a little colloquy of an equivocal nature and it be -- that colloquy being recorded by a police stenographer who was there, who was not identified to Johnson as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.381" offset="1620929">I state at this point that it's perfectly clear and there's no dispute about this that at no time during the evening up until this question and answer confession which occurred at 6 o'clock, had at no time in the custody of the police was Johnson warned that he might be silent, that anything he would -- said would be used against him or that -- as a matter of fact, I'd better put it in the words of the trial court who was -- said it quite plainly on his -- on some findings which appear at page 2 -- 329 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.666" offset="1817997">No police officer told the defendant at any time from the time he was taken into custody at the rear of 20 Fernwood Road until he had completed his statement to Lieutenant Donovan that he had the right to remain silent or the right to refuse to answer any questions put to him by the police or that anything he said to the police might or could be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.959" offset="1915173">So, that is clear as throughout the evening.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.839" offset="2350686">Well, the trial judge found they were four.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.951" offset="2371166">I found two on the record but I can say that because Mr. Concannon, my brother has said to the trial judge found they were four.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.576" offset="2405648">They were -- of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.948" offset="2411186">And some might -- there might have been three.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.760" offset="2418395">There was a little confusion about that if they had -- there could've been four.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.439" offset="2433128">You could say they were two but in any event it was of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.762" offset="2450369">And the witnesses who identified Johnson or some of the witnesses who identified Johnson and there were several, testified that a -- as he appeared in the lineup, blood appeared on various parts of his body, some on his head, some on his legs, his clothing was tattered and torn.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.970" offset="2539290">So that -- it's perfectly clear that without dispute that through the evening there was still observation of bleeding and bruise, some injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.774" offset="2590490">With respect to the injury it's also clear that two weeks after the confession, Johnson was operated on for a condition called a Subdural Hematoma which is a collection of blood between the dura and the brain and that condition was relieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.269" offset="2672410">And the record goes as five but no further than -- that it was that condition was consistent with having been there two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.877" offset="2714833">Which goes takes it back to the time of this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.217" offset="2740224">Then at 6 o'clock in the morning, approximately, in a room in police headquarters, the statement was taken by a police stenographer, the only persons present were policemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.959" offset="2803231">And the statement was in question and answers form and as I believe will be apparent upon the slightest reading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.451" offset="2841161">It is a catalog of the prima facie elements of each of the crimes so which Johnson was indicted four days later to wit -- murder in the first degree, armed robbery while masked, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, carrying of a revolver without a license and carrying of a revolver in a vehicle without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.949" offset="2951189">And the Q &amp; A goes right down each of the elements goes through the license and all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.852" offset="2986820">It further appears that Johnson was an unemployed man of -- with an IQ that was taken by the state in the proceedings under the so-called Briggs Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.374" offset="3052857">With an IQ of 86 and education that pitted out somewhere when he was 16 years old, he certainly didn't get beyond the eight grade, he might have been still on the sixth grade in special classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.728" offset="3106252">The -- his answers to the examining people are not entirely clear but at 16 he quit school and he was either on a special eight grade or a sixth grade, one of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.339" offset="3164766">I think I urged Your Honors that on this recitation of the facts, the facts very largely speak for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.948" offset="3219205">Here, we plainly have a citizen who was injured, was disadvantaged in this intellect, in his education who was the subject of a process which to use the colloquial terms, box him in by the confrontations in the interrogations.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.940" offset="3307081">And then in our atmosphere it is unquestionably police dominated and without warning advice or counsel or friend or adviser, he gives a question and answer statement which is a catalog of the prima facie elements of these crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.763" offset="3410422">Quite plainly, this was in no sense an attempt to find out what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.581" offset="3441664">It was a procedure to wrap up the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.552" offset="3465592">The trial judge found that at the time of the confession, Johnson was the prime suspect in the felonious homicide of James B. O'Leary who was the victim of the shooting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.067" offset="4743607">A lot of mileage had been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.796" offset="4790523">It's perfectly obvious that the police were doing an efficient wrap up job here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.662" offset="4814033">They didn't have the stenographer their to treasure the pros, I mean they had a reason for it and what I suggest is that that police action not of itself but with all these other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.447" offset="4877145">For instance, in Spano this Court gave considerable weight to the undeviating purpose of the officers to produce the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.178" offset="4916120">The -- there and Spano was -- is the lead one but there are other cases where the -- where it's perfectly plain that the police were proceeding to a wrap up procedure was a factor which this Court gave weight in all the circumstances on the question of whether this Court would deem the confessions to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.992" offset="5019355">Now, I hope -- I'd like not to tell you on this point fundamental as it is to my position because I now want to come to the procedures which I -- which are quite a separate point and do not in any sense depend nor does the point I have just made depend on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.212" offset="5108172">My first point is that the courts in Massachusetts never in their procedure gave consideration to this issue with the range of criteria which this Court requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.328" offset="5184658">I don't need to argue that this Court has said that these items I have argued about of the mental and educational condition of the defendant, his injuries, his custodial isolation, his warnings or lack of warning, are the criteria which must be considered on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.003" offset="5287372">I don't think I need to argue either that the courts below must pay he to the criteria set down by this Court in making that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.679" offset="5342124">I scarcely need to argue that in this case, the Massachusetts Courts did not give consideration to that broad range of criteria, to that increasingly meticulous test which -- as was said in one of the recent cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.851" offset="5426761">I'll come to the reason why, which is my third point, but I thought that an orderly presentation would require establishing this point that they did not first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.976" offset="5467303">It is perfectly clear from the record that the trial court at the trial itself did not -- considered only one aspect and that appears and I can only do this -- I can do this best by reading it at page 189 where the trial justice said to the then defense counsel, the contention of the defendant as I understand it is that, and there's a typographical error, is that the statement was involuntarily given because of physical force applied to the defendant by the police so that the statement was coerced from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.413" offset="5641070">That is the position as I understand it that the defendant takes is that correct Mr. Colloquo (ph)?</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.304" offset="5664580">Mr. Colloquo (ph): "That is correct Your Honor".</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.118" offset="5675865">This was said at the conclusion of a voir dire out of the presence of the jury where there had been testimony by Mr. Johnson that he was beaten by the police and testimony by a succession of policemen who were present that they had not beaten Mr. Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.124" offset="5743888">On that point, there is the sharpest conflict of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.212" offset="5764263">At the con -- and after getting the defendant's contention with that position at the end of the voir dire and indeed it's been also about at the beginning of the voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.161" offset="5812015">The Court said, "I am not satisfied from the evidence that it was not freely and competently given and therefore I rule that it is admissible".</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.672" offset="5870111">So that obviously at the trial that on the sole focus of the question of voluntariness was whether or not there was a physical beating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.770" offset="5918490">Then, on the motion for new trial which was after the Escobedo case, the determination of that and it was in a sense a non-determination, the motion was denied where their remark by the trial judge at the questions raised were more -- were in any event more properly, those decided by the Supreme Court but the focus of the Court's attention, by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, I misspoke myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.094" offset="6043773">The focus of the Court's contention was plainly on the counsel question and not the voluntariness question as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.314" offset="6076583">I think this appears perfectly plainly and here again, I can do no better than read from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.634" offset="6097899">I really couldn't paraphrase as well and there's a sentence which appears in the record at page 329.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.413" offset="6136978">I find his willingness to talk to Lieutenant Donovan at this time, in 6:00, was not a waiver of any right in quotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.406" offset="6176998">He had to remain silent and to refuse to talk to the police at that time or to be cautioned by the police at that time of such "rights” if it should be determined that in the circumstances he had any one or all of such "rights".</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.998" offset="6263411">And the focus is quite plainly on the relationship of warning rights and counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.261" offset="6300400">In that posture of events the case was appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court which essentially said that the determination of the voluntariness of the confession was one of fact and the trial judge had so determined and that essentially was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.622" offset="6393814">They said also that the -- it was incumbent upon counsel below at the trial to have raised the other contentions with respect to involuntariness that were then raised before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.498" offset="6465390">And then he said that in any event when the trial judge and it was of course the trial judge who heard the motion for new trial in accordance with the Massachusetts unusual practice that in any event he must have had all these factors in mind when he denied the motion for the new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.581" offset="6553684">I suggest that in the light of the judge's meticulous findings, rulings and orders after the motion for a new trial which I've been reading from that that is really not quite wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.631" offset="6621915">Now, the -- this tunnel vision of the Massachusetts Courts with respect to the criteria to be considered on the voluntary issue in this case is I suggest accounted for by the rule which was plainly applied by the Massachusetts Court and fourth, rightly stated to be the role in the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.936" offset="6735078">And that rule which was applied and which was enunciated is that the burden of proof of showing involuntariness is upon the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.122" offset="6791816">That statement follows the assertion which has been variously phrased that the confession when introduced is prima facie voluntary or as presumptively voluntary, that of course explains the double negative in the judge's ruling which I explained and given that rule which this judge as a Massachusetts judge was bound to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.149" offset="6943953">It follows that it was entirely proper for him to query closely trial counsel as to the precise ground of involuntariness in this spectrum or in this criteria of (Voice Overlap) --</text>
