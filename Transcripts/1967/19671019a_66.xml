            <text syncTime="43.413" offset="276982">Mr. Justice Fortas, my associates have advised me that I did not precisely answer your last question to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.735" offset="314284">At times I do not hear as well as I did 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.709" offset="334242">So please bear with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.184" offset="344064">Your Honor asked me whether the commercial packing houses, which constitute approximately 15% of Sunkist membership, all handle oranges and canned and freeze them.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.249" offset="396413">Now they do all handle oranges and in the year 1957, 1958 for example this amounted to $15 million worth of oranges, but they do not freeze or can oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.041" offset="459525">This is done by the processing division of Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.814" offset="478647">Here is what the packing houses do.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.076" offset="491708">They purchase the oranges from the growers under a cost plus contract which I will go into; they pick, wash, grade and then market the fruit through Sunkist as a Sunkist member.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.946" offset="547192">Now I would like to, if I may, turn briefly to discuss some of the answers Sunkist does raise to our conventions.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.265" offset="700479">They have stipulated they are not associations organized under the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.744" offset="730363">Now Your Honors I have read and reread Sunkist brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.155" offset="751992">I haven't found a single sentence, not a single word that bases up to this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.936" offset="775084">The language in Section 1 of the Act before this Court explicitly provides only actual farmers; growers may form a Capper-Volstead Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.048" offset="823568">I have not found a single word, not a single sentence showing that Congress did not mean that when they enacted the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.730" offset="858258">Now I have found pages of argument as to what Congress intended when it passed the General Agricultural Marketing Act, the Sherman Act and the Farm Laborers Exemption and Appropriation Acts and I have read Sunkist story of the California Association Raisin Company problem with the Federal Trade Commission, but I don't think that as of any consequence, but I am going to refer one moment to the California Raisin Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.135" offset="983960">Sunkist contention to abbreviate seemed to be that a Capper-Volstead Association may have non-grower investors who may receive dividends not to exceed 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.908" offset="1039026">Well let us assume this is correct, the legislative history is entirely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.986" offset="1067342">Well that isn't the question we have to contend with and now you are not going to contend the questions not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.348" offset="1100779">Sunkist is not a capital stock corporation and there is no legislative history supporting the view that middlemen, packers, commercial packing houses could comprise the membership of a Capper-Volstead Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.555" offset="1169638">Now I do notice Sunkist cites one reference to the affect that this California Raisin Association may have been contemplated by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.360" offset="1224808">It may impact that a Capper-Volstead Association, well that was the capital stock association could have commercial investors, but it was clear that the membership had to be packers as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.605" offset="1341837">For example I am going to read one quote from the legislative history of HR 13931, which is a history they quote -- they re-quote one referenced to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.464" offset="1405262">Now it's the 65th Congress predecessor Bill of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.399" offset="1428982">Senator Lenroot of Wisconsin:</text>
            <text syncTime="335.219" offset="1444237">“I think that under this measure there might be various kinds of organizations and that they could all combine into one new organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.188" offset="1480077">I do not believe however that under the terms of the Bill an organization of wheat farmers could combine with an organization of cotton growers and the association of wheat growers, sell cotton or deal with it in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.402" offset="1532949">” Senator King: “but could they combine with the millers or the warehouse men?</text>
            <text syncTime="363.877" offset="1558862">” Senator Lenroot, who was one of the sponsors of the Bill: “certainly not, a miller would not be within the terms of the proposed law at all nor would a warehouse be.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.647" offset="1625945">” Now Your Honor, Sunkist contends that the issue presented by this writ or decided by the Court in Sunkist Growers Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.541" offset="1689579">versus Winckler &amp; Smith Citrus Products Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.920" offset="1711104">This was Sunkist's primary contention in the District Court and Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.557" offset="1729599">For example in the District Court, the District Court asked Sun, stated he says, I am not going into the issue, that's the Capper-Volstead issue that was decided by the Court in the Winckler case and he asked Sunkist counsel, don't you think that's correct and the counsel replied and I quote, “we believe the court is absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.996" offset="1827401">” Our position on this is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.968" offset="1843284">The issue before this Court was not disposed off in the Winckler case.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.445" offset="1865122">Winckler conceded that that Sunkist was a Capper-Volstead Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.990" offset="1887378">On the other hand, we challenge the wholeness of the majority decision of the Court of Appeals that Sunkist was a Capper-Volstead Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.629" offset="1929906">Next contention; Sunkist argues that membership of its non-growers, that is its commercial packing houses has no legal or economic significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.742" offset="1982360">This seems to have emerged as the principal contention before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.741" offset="2014333">The main theme is stated at page 55 of the Sunkist brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.840" offset="2038784">It argues, a membership certificate is of the minimus importance without economic significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.735" offset="2074311">In other words, they say that membership in Congress -- in Sunkist is just a scrap of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.001" offset="2115375">We do not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.252" offset="2128332">Our position is that permitting non-growers, middlemen, packers, commercial packing houses to organize a Capper-Volstead Association is not of the minimus importance and it is not without great economic significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.787" offset="2206490">In this case alone, for example Sunkist non-grower membership of commercial packing houses furnished approximately 13% of Sunkist citrus fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.628" offset="2265840">In the year 1957, 1958 this 13% amounted to over $15 million of oranges alone controlled by Sunkist, not counting the lemons and the grape fruit and for the same year it amounted to over $23 million of Sunkist total sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.857" offset="2366777">Your Honors thus these non-grower commercial packing houses very appreciably strengthen Sunkist monopoly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.253" offset="2412335">They very appreciably enabled Sunkist to wrongly use monopoly power and attempt to monopolize in violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.391" offset="2480985">It would hardly need mentioning that members of a membership association control the association, its management and the packing houses are the most important members of Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.072" offset="2543679">Only the packing houses which include these commercial packing houses have proprietary rights and interests in Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.448" offset="2589132">Congress deliberately chose language that would preclude the middlemen, flour mills, packers, commercial packing houses from organizing Capper-Volstead Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.443" offset="2645138">May I ask Your Honors, if 15% could become members of a cooperative why not 50%, why not a 100%.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Henderson</label>
            <text syncTime="659.469" offset="2741269">The packers are represented on the Board of Directors through the agency of the district exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.884" offset="2778885">The district exchange represents the packing houses that the board is controlled by the volume of fruit from the packing houses only the packing houses contribute fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.040" offset="2839489">The district exchange is a conduit of information as described.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.399" offset="2864985">They do not grow fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.895" offset="2878986">They communicate between Sunkist and the packing houses, but basically the ownership in the corporation is restricted to the packing houses and the packing houses through the district exchange and depending upon the volume of fruit select the governing body of Sunkist directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.468" offset="2981282">So in other words, we submit that a holding by this Court that non-growers such as commercial packing houses may combine in cooperatives and fix the price of their products or services would open the door to price fixing by packers, commercial packing houses or anyone who in a broad sense produces an agricultural product, but does not grow it and the Act and the Congressional history states, the members must be growers or I will say Capper-Volstead Association of grower which I deem would be the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.670" offset="3178036">Now Sunkist argues that despite the provisions of the contract under which Sunkist non-grower members obtained the growers fruit, the tile to the fruit does not pass to the commercial packing houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.000" offset="3243342">This is the argument been picked up in the majority decision in the Court of Appeals and I think this is the point Justice Fortas have interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.659" offset="3282004">Now here what the majority decisions states.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.295" offset="3296528">He asked this question; does the fact that the so called agency associations constitute a class of membership prevents Sunkist from being a person engaged in the production of an agricultural product under Section 1 of the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="816.356" offset="3368835">Now that question is confusing because Sunkist has never contended that Sunkist was a producer of agricultural product.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.477" offset="3409272">The contention that has been that Sunkist is Capper-Volstead Association that markets the fruit of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.773" offset="3450441">Then the majority decision posed the preamble to that part of the Capper-Volstead relation which providing that the exhibit B to the stipulation is a typical contract under which Sunkist non-grower members acquire a growers fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.663" offset="3530062">Now this preamble states that these commercial packing houses or costs and a fixed fee furnish their services on an independent contract basis unrelated to their returns from the fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.863" offset="3606862">This preamble is but one way of stating that these commercial packing houses will not gamble their profits or as a assured as with the commercial enterprise profits that provided the war materials under cost plus contracts in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.050" offset="3703620">The important points on this are first; the growers under this cost plus contract have no control over the costs of these commercial packing houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.486" offset="3761298">Second; the growers have no control over these commercial packing houses when they as Sunkist members control Sunkist management and its policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.450" offset="3817200">Sunkist argues title doesn't pass and I think that's an idle argument because the title passes at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.678" offset="3866102">The contract specifically provides that it does pass and they sell it, but it passes at least when it has reached the supermarket or when the fruit have may reached Your Honors at your breakfast table.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.691" offset="3930154">The point is they are non-growers, they are middlemen and they purchase their fruit or acquire it from commercial packing houses and they have no voice in fixing the cost of these commercial packing houses and they have no voice in the management of Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.464" offset="4029210">Sunkist also argues that Capper-Volstead Association could legally enter into a contract such as exhibit B with non-grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.568" offset="4073618">A grower or a cooperative could have entered into this contract, perhaps he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.162" offset="4120012">A Capper-Volstead Association no doubt and may does enter in many types of contracts with packers, packing houses, painters, plumbers, lawyers, knowing the people, but that's not the issue Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.766" offset="4190438">The issue on this writ of certiorari is who may comprise the membership of a Capper-Volstead Association, not who may a duly organized Capper-Volstead Association contract with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.608" offset="9277837">With the Court's permission this morning I should first of all like to talk about a matter of two terminology and then perhaps briefly review the Sunkist system and its units before we go forward with some of the more complicated questions of the membership within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.251" offset="9344397">I was interested to note in Mr. Henderson's opening remarks that he referred to the petitioner herein as a small packer and the Sunkist as the dominant combination marketing citrus fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.281" offset="9396537">I suppose we could easily get into a battle of adjectives and I think if we have to fight about dominative, Sunkist could probably do very well in that battle, because we represent the small grower who has a backyard full of citrus trees, who has two or three acres as well as the larger growers who are large enough to pack their own fruit in their own packing houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.334" offset="9484727">But we do not feel this is basically a question of who is bigger than whom or who is smaller than whom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.952" offset="9507192">We believe we are dealing here as the Court indicated in the Winckler case with a question of substance.</text>

I think one other question of terminology should be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.650" offset="9597994">Mr. Henderson pointed out that although the stipulation which both parties signed described these associations as agency associations he doesn't now like that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.015" offset="9643447">He wants to call them commercial packing houses and of course he may define his terms in any sense he prefers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.148" offset="9675943">But to me and to the orange industry the term commercial packing house means something different and I think it points out precisely what this litigation is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.612" offset="9717844">A commercial packing house to me means an individual business enterprise which buys up fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.176" offset="9744071">Generally speaking that enterprise will go out to the farmer, he will look at his growth and he will by the fruit on the tree, often perhaps in advance as a hedge against a free use or something of that sort and the packer then owns that fruit, it's his and he may now speculate on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.239" offset="9812302">He can hope to hold it at a time when the market will bring a higher price for that fruit and whatever price he gets for that fruit is his.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.847" offset="9842709">He no longer owes the grower a cent, other than purchase price that he buys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.555" offset="9865592">Now this is precisely the kind of middleman which the Capper-Volstead Act was aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.078" offset="9891715">The man who had money in his pocket, who could go out and buy the farmer's product and then he could speculate on what he could make on that product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.625" offset="9925883">That's the flouring mills that have been referred to in the legislative history Mr. Henderson talks about and that to us is a commercial packing house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.897" offset="9962977">Stipulation here is crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.528" offset="9973530">There is no commercial packing house in the Sunkist system in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.259" offset="9992443">The stipulation points out on pages 36 and 37 of the record that all of the economic benefit of the Sunkist system returns to the grower, through these agency associations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.347" offset="10700779">Now more specifically about 13% of the oranges which are marketed through Sunkist come into the system through an agency association.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.923" offset="10967019">Now you will note that I draw the distinction between the member of the Sunkist system as a whole and the technical membership as a corporate member of Sunkist Growers Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.415" offset="11012995">These are different unities in my view and I'll come to that point in a moment, but that's only one of the many unities and structures in Sunkist Grower System as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.020" offset="11055417">Let's take a look at the system, because it seems to me that it would be helpful to know a little bit more about how Sunkist operates and what these various structures do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.367" offset="11100871">I want to point out that the facts I'm now going to discuss on what the plaintiff says as it's critical issue are actually quite different for the two halves of this lawsuit, because as I understand the plaintiff's position is a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.001" offset="11151339">The agency association is a member of Sunkist Growers, therefore per se, that terminates the question on exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.625" offset="11185821">That wasn't true as a fact, when this lawsuit was filed and is not true for about half of the period covered by the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.563" offset="11217586">The complaint was filed in this lawsuit on April 15, 1958, seeking damages for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.881" offset="11246947">A supplemental complaint was filed in June 1962 adding almost an additional four years to January 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.517" offset="11281429">So we cover a period of little less than seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.182" offset="11296057">On October 31, 1958 various changes were made in the Sunkist structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.550" offset="11317582">So for a period now about three and a half years to start with, we have a different fact situation, from the second period of a little less than three and a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.023" offset="11355512">Now let me tell you first about the first half of this lawsuit and then what the changes were for the second half of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.315" offset="11384665">As you now know, Sunkist is basically a pyramidal structure, it's built on a principle of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.725" offset="11410265">We have at the base as the record says some 12,000 growers, actually the number of growers in California are decreasing; subdivisions, increased property taxes are cutting down the production of oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.545" offset="11457599">But nevertheless the growers at the base and the grower on an individual non-cooperative basis produces his own fruit up to the point of picking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.252" offset="11496364">Generally speaking the Sunkist System or the packing house has nothing to do with raising the fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.710" offset="11522173">They have research assistants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.479" offset="11529279">They may do -- provide some assistance with respect to problems of growing, but that's an individual problem for the grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.697" offset="11558118">When he brings his fruit to the point where it's ready to picked, generally the packing house picks it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.479" offset="11577240">Now it may on occasion not be picked by the packing house, but it is then brought to a packing house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.631" offset="11601899">At the packing house the physical handing of the fresh fruit for marketing takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.567" offset="11625618">Now bear in mind this lawsuit is for product fruit and therefore I mentioned fresh fruit only in passing because it does tie into the structure of Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.528" offset="11661458">But the packing house function is a function dealing with fresh fruit primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.938" offset="11683088">There the fruit is sorted, it's washed, it's graded, it's packed and when it's sold it's shipped directly from the packing house to the ultimate purchaser, it doesn't go to any other Sunkist facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.065" offset="11731675">When however a decision is made that the fruit is to be product grouped, for whatever reason, it probably is already at the packing house, it may still be at the farm. But when that decision is made, the fruit is moved directly to the processing facilities of Sunkist and it may never go to the packing house or it may be there only briefly and go to Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.890" offset="11818924">And it is at the processing facilities of Sunkist known generally as Exchange Orange, where the fruit is juiced, it's processed into either concentrated juice or however it's sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.987" offset="11867303">It maybe sold as chilled juice, it maybe sold into various peeled products, it maybe sold peeled products as fertilizer or various pharmaceuticals, whatever product is built from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.290" offset="11916518">When product fruit -- the product that is then made or perhaps I should go back a step, the determination as to whether that fruit will be sold perhaps a whole fruit to a processor or will be processed into a particular product is made by Sunkist, it's not made by the packing house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.638" offset="11985899">Sunkist also makes the determination where it will be sold, when it will sold, what the price will be, and who the purchaser is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.830" offset="12018709">As you can appreciate the fruit from mini growers is pooled in this kind of a process and therefore an accounting is kept on the quality of the fruit which comes in, the percentage of solids that the fruit has, so the grower can be fairly paid and when Sunkist has a return, the return is paid back first to the packing house on product fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.165" offset="12112018">The packing house in turn under the agreement determines which of its growers brought that fruit into Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.991" offset="12139290">The packing house deducts its fixed fee and its costs and returns the net proceeds of operation back to the grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.540" offset="12177533">Now in terms of the formal organization of Sunkist, the grower signs the contract, which is attached as Exhibit B to the stipulation, if he is dealing with an agency association.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.834" offset="12294666">So far as the operating funds are concerned, Sunkist operates on the basis of revolving funds, so that from product fruit an amount not to exceed $0.50 a tonne is withheld as a revolving fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.177" offset="12360077">As it's paid in, it's paid back out to the people who first had that deduction made and that means in effect that a growers gets back all of his money now except this assessment and about six or seven years later he gets back that small amount which operates as Sunkist's operating capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.961" offset="12431235">Now that applies uniformly across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.518" offset="12445445">If however the grower is dealing through a cooperative association and you are aware I am sure that about 80% of the Sunkist fruit comes in through cooperatives, the cooperative will also have a similar arrangement for paying its capital costs, so that it generally will have either a capital contribution or a revolving fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.241" offset="12532381">When the fund is paid back from Sunkist to a cooperative, it will deduct its capital charge and then return the proceeds after its costs, return its proceeds to the grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.334" offset="12576684">When the funds come back to the agency association, instead of deducting the capital fund it deducts its charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.355" offset="12608763">In other words, to put the situation I think simply in effect the grower and the agency association is running the facilities and paying a rental today for the services he gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.411" offset="12653066">The grower who uses a cooperative does it on an amortizing basis where he participates in a revolving fund and must maintain a part of the capital to maintain those facilities and the end result of this for the grower you can see is a substantial advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.156" offset="12711999">It means the growers has two choices instead of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.438" offset="12725164">Instead of getting into a cooperative where he must commit his capital to maintain the packing house facilities, he may pay it on a current basis, a rental type basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.115" offset="12767796">Instead of my building the house, I'll have you build it and I'll pay you so much a year out of the fruit that goes through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.551" offset="12797576">Now of course as you also aware both the contract here which is set up as between the grower and the agency association and each of the units in the Sunkist have the right every year to terminate that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.699" offset="12858180">So that if the grower doesn't like the amount that he is having to pay to this agency association he can terminate it at the end of any year in addition to the escape clause which was mentioned few moments ago and this serves a very healthy purpose within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.161" offset="12920038">As I've indicated we have the order of the 120 packing houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.093" offset="12935711">If you've ever driven through the oranges growers, orange district of Southern California and gone into a little town such as Redlands or San Bernardino or Orange and gone down by the railroad track, you'll see lined up one after the other orange packing houses, agency house, a cooperative, a cooperative, an agency house, and if you are a grower you can walk into any one of those and sign them up for next year and if you don't like the fees in one house and you don't like the way you are getting paid you have a good healthy competition between them or if you think an agency -- if you think the cooperative can serve you better, you can walk next door and have your fruit delivered to a cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.207" offset="13092237">After you get your fruit on a truck, it's only a question of 30 or 40 minutes on a good highway to dozens of packing houses within your area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.032" offset="13127450">So we have a healthy competition between the packing houses that means an additional service and benefit to grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.125" offset="13155871">Now let me go back to the formal organization of Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.061" offset="13171649">We know now how they --</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.834" offset="13210728">Sunkist serves an area up into the San Joaquin Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.138" offset="13231940">As you know the large orange growing areas are centered between say Redlands and down into Orange County, but there are oranges into San Diego, there are citrus product -- there is citrus production in the Coachella Valley and there are now large new growers being planted in the San Joaquin Valley, largely navels for the fresh fruit market, however navels don't process very well and there are packing houses in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.418" offset="13341027">So you are quite correct Your Honor there is a concentration in Southern California, but there are outlying areas and there are I believe eight or nine houses in Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.432" offset="13405080">We know now that the growers are in the packing houses and one of these three kinds of relations, an agency association, a cooperative or they may have their own packing house which they've built.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.029" offset="13455444">They are then organized into district exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.512" offset="13465370">Historically the stipulation points out how the district exchanges grew as the first unit of development to bring them together in their market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.998" offset="13495359">The associations are members of the district exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.008" offset="13515421">They are non-profit cooperative membership associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.418" offset="13537050">The packing houses elect the representatives to the district exchanges.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.713" offset="13646242">Now in answer to Justice Black's question a few moments ago, Sunkist is in fact run by a Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.971" offset="13675290">Sunkist is a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.319" offset="13684694">It's a nonprofit membership corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.352" offset="13696815">Its members and its Board of Directors were identical in the first half of this lawsuit, approximately 17 individuals each nominated by a district exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.950" offset="13735163">They determine the policy of Sunkist and equally important they hire the principal employees, the economists who are necessary for examination of the market, the statisticians or the general manager right on down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.730" offset="13790333">So Sunkist is operated in effect by that Board of Directors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.996" offset="14255313">What is a member that we are talking about, what's the critical sense of member in this litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.995" offset="14283316">I haven't been talking about members of the Sunkist system or the member of the cooperative at all in my sense of the word and yet I think what I have said the impression you have is yes we are talking about the same members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.297" offset="14332531">I am talking about a corporate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.699" offset="14342144">Sunkist Growers Incorporated is a nonprofit corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.012" offset="14359385">For its purposes and its by laws its corporate members are designated to certain people and they come through a representative system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.195" offset="14396165">They do and they did during half of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.684" offset="14410062">Now I don't think when we talk about the Capper-Volstead cooperative or the Capper-Volstead qualification we're necessarily talking about that member at all, who we call a member in our bylaws as a matter of corporate technical structure of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.923" offset="14483101">When we talk about the Sunkist System as a whole now, this Court has already said in Winckler that we are dealing with a unified organization the Sunkist system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.565" offset="14521657">Now let's set apart for a moment the Sunkist system over here as a whole and Sunkist Growers Incorporated, a nonprofit corporation which sits at the apex of that pyramidal structure, who are the members of the Sunkist system?</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.014" offset="14579440">Well I would suggest to you members of the Sunkist system are those people who have its beneficial interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4143.403" offset="16676968">Perhaps we are going to draw a distinction here and it maybe appropriate between members and stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.276" offset="16700479">But it is apparent that first of all the Senate particularly looked carefully at the Raisin Growers Association and they found first of all that the raisin growers had non-grower stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.444" offset="16749171">There are about 2,400 grower stockholders there were about 800 non-grower stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.504" offset="16769337">So roughly about a quarter of the stockholders were non-growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.081" offset="16791698">They also had in their bylaws however that they could not pay dividends more than 8%, that's apparently where this came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.642" offset="16825971">So they contemplated that here was an association with non-grower stockholders who could participate in both their stock but that they were limited to an 8% return on their capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.653" offset="16878007">Now I think the key also maybe found in the phrase, which talks about what we believe to be the fundamental test of Capper-Volstead, and that is provided however this is the test to our way of thinking of the validity of Capper-Volstead qualification, provided however that such associations are operated for the mutual benefit of the members thereof as such producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.529" offset="16985527">Now why would the qualification as such producers be necessary?</text>

            <text syncTime="5520.982" offset="22187342">Capper-Volstead to my way of thinking does basically two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.666" offset="22206046">It permits the farmers to get together in a very liberal fashion to market their fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.113" offset="22231855">It lays down a test and that is it must be done for the benefit of the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.146" offset="22255992">Now that's the test that's within Capper-Volstead and I suggest to you that if we meet that organizational test as the Bill itself said if the farmers in good faith are cooperatively marketing their fruit that they are qualified to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.489" offset="22321298">Now Mr. Justice Black clearly laid down the additional requirements which should be mentioned here because it's important in this particular area where you have just questioning me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.116" offset="22367796">In Maryland and Virginia this Court said that you may have Capper-Volstead organization duly qualified, but it still may violate the Antitrust Act if it does certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.393" offset="22416906">Now what's the test?</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.273" offset="22420459">Well, there are two key phrases there, which I think very clearly lay out what the basic problem is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.185" offset="22448149">The key test was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.165" offset="22455986">Are the acts which the cooperative has engaged in legitimate cooperative activities or are there predatory trade practices?</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.999" offset="22499349">Now to the extent that we attempt to corral all of the packing house facilities and prevent somebody else from using them, if that constitutes a predatory trade practice as it's probably would and the manner in which the question was stated to me, the cooperative is liable for the damage it causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.663" offset="22582000">Now let's note the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.622" offset="22589837">There is a still a Capper-Volstead cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.954" offset="22599137">It still maybe organized appropriately, but it has monetary civil and criminal liability for violation of antitrust statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.931" offset="22635081">Now when Mr. Henderson points out that he claims here that we monopolize the oranges in some way to do him harm, that's not our question here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.823" offset="22674683">Our question today is are we qualified? We are going back and we are perfectly happy and willing to live by that Maryland and Virginia standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.808" offset="22706552">If we have engaged in predatory trade practices we expect to pay for it and that's the issue we are going to try when we go to the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5673.691" offset="22798085">If we're acting in good faith for the benefit of the farmer we are qualified.</text>

            <text syncTime="5939.320" offset="23860642">Mr. Chief justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.084" offset="23883734">I am only going to take up to few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.281" offset="23892511">First the stipulation so that we shall be clear just what we are speaking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.404" offset="23928978">There were some questions of whether we were talking about non-growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.913" offset="23942980">Now I want to refer Your Honors to page 35 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.276" offset="23972446">Three corporate growers were not concerned with the ones that corporation that grow fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5976.649" offset="24009958">They constitute for 0.975 by number and for 0.72 by volume, but we are concerned with item 4, what are called agency associations and we call them commercial packing houses and the stipulation is clear on that, they are non-growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.212" offset="24096266">For example, agency associations constitute 14.91% by number and 49% by volume of all associations in the Sunkist system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.845" offset="24154781">The agency association is normally a private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.577" offset="24173693">Such agency associations do not qualify nor do they claim to be cooperative associations acting under Section 1 of Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.958" offset="24227192">The agency association furnishes these facilities on the independent contract basis and relate it to net returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.619" offset="24269824">A contract between such an agency association and it's growers which maybe deemed typical of such associations is attached here to as Exhibit B. Further showing they're not growers, this Court may refer in page 41 where it defines the different functions, on the second whole paragraph with regard to the physical handling of fruit, the growers cares for the fruit, cares for the trees and brings the citrus fruit to the point where it is ready to be picked.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.031" offset="24431470">The packing house association then normally sends its specialized crews into the groves to pick the fruit and it is stipulated that they obtain their fruit under Exhibit B to the contract now, and that provide the sale of the fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6099.932" offset="24503150">Now, I'm also going to mention Mr. Hufstedler's argument that for the first half of the lawsuit the member -- these commercial associations or these packing houses, all members were not members.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.736" offset="24586324">Well, this lawsuit commenced May 15, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.068" offset="24619656">On October 3, the October 1, 1958 then all packing house members became direct denominated members of Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.787" offset="24682559">And may I refer the Court to page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.486" offset="24721324">Only the packing house members have property rights and interests in Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.911" offset="24751000">Now, as to the district exchange, they only representative, the packing houses and that is stipulated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.934" offset="24803140">Even before they were direct members, they were indirect members through the packing -- through the district exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="6191.224" offset="24868237">It still retained it's same corporate structure, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="6195.986" offset="24887359">And it was just a separate corporation which was members of Sunkist?</text>

            <text syncTime="6200.892" offset="24906898">In other words before October 31 they were represented to the district exchange which has stipulated to its one of the conduits of communication and representation between the packing house association and Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6219.431" offset="24981086">So before that time they were indirect members.</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.853" offset="24998745">After October 1, 1958 and during most of the period of this suit they became direct members and they are the only packing house members that have property rights and interests in Sunkist.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6239.768" stopTime="6242.820">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="6239.768" offset="25062484">Now has something else happened since then?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_henderson" startTime="6242.820" stopTime="6544.593">
            <label>Mr. William H. Henderson</label>
            <text syncTime="6242.820" offset="25074604">Not that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="6244.994" offset="25083382">Our discovery -- this -- all I know is up to this -- we stipulated that up till 1962 during the period encompassed so far that's how it remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.089" offset="25127685">They are all members, they're denominated members, they still are the only members who have interest before that, realistically they were the only members who had interests in Sunkist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.167" offset="25188080">Now, the next argument is that the growers receive all the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.988" offset="25235310">Well that isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.518" offset="25245445">When the packing house is the Capper-Volstead Association then the growers are in practical affect Sunkist members.</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.324" offset="25280658">We don't quarrel with that, we think the Court implied that in the Winckler Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.921" offset="25303019">But when the packing house is an agency association or more accurately a commercial packing house it's neither a grower, neither an association growers, it is not in any realistic theory a Sunkist member and the grower does not receive the benefits of cooperative marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6322.042" offset="25391522">First, a grower is marketing his fruit through a middleman or he -- or for his fruit he receives the net returns from the fruit less the cost of the commercial packing house and he has no control over the cost of this commercial packing house.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.581" offset="25477726">And then there's a fixed fee per case of fruit, it's the cost plus contract, the type of contract which was so popular in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.315" offset="25520671">Second, the agency association over which the grower which belongs to it has no control, that association is the member that sits in the Sunkist meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.726" offset="25590262">He is the member who controls Sunkist in the final analysis and he determines the policy that is all the packing, whether it's the benevolent or whether it's predatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.269" offset="25648462">Now, Your Honor in conclusion, we are not concerned with the provisos.</text>
            <text syncTime="6397.994" offset="25695378">We are concerned with the first sentence of the first section.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.375" offset="25720874">The first sentence says who may be a member of a Capper-Volstead Association and the history is clear that is the farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6418.784" offset="25778552">It is stipulated that these agency associations are not cooperative so that they do not comply with provisos one, two or three, we don't have to argue that because they stipulate, they don't comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.926" offset="25855039">The legislative history shows that this was the intent of Congress and this Court's decision in Milk Producers Association versus United States stated this to be the intent of Congress and Your Honor in the Gordon (ph) case this Court stated the persons to whom the Capper-Volstead Act applies are defined in Section 1 as producers of agricultural products.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.414" offset="26001011">In the Milk Producers case, the Court said that Congress intended actual farmers that was the intent to take advantage of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6505.175" offset="26124100">Now under that situation may it please the Court, I believe it's settled law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6511.869" offset="26150849">It is not a judicial function to rewrite the language of a statute clearly, ambiguity and permit non-growers, commercial packing houses to organize Capper-Volstead Association, that is our contention that it's only for farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.757" offset="26242382">Well, we believe this language means what it says and it applies all associations, even Sunkist, thank you.</text>
