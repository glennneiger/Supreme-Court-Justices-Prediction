            <text syncTime="721.259" offset="2988387">Basically, appellant agrees that the first issue before the Court is the current status of the Gerende decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.776" offset="3030497">However, before addressing or readdressing myself as the case maybe to Gerende, it might be appropriate for me to just outline briefly the four substantive or meritorious grounds on which appellant contends that the oath and the statute are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.976" offset="3099251">First, I suggest that it's our position that the oath and the statute were unconstitutionally broad, vague and uncertain in degradation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.553" offset="3145540">Second, we contend that this indiscriminate loyalty of or non-disloyalty disclaimer, otherwise unconstitutionally infringes the First and Fourteenth Amendment freedoms of belief, association and academic freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.368" offset="3200815">Third, in violation of procedural due process, the oath and the statute further infringe the First and Fourteenth Amendment interests by denying public employment without affording any hearing on questions of loyalty or subversiveness and by shifting burdens of proof with respect to these questions to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.656" offset="3269987">And fourth, together the statute and the oath constitute an unlawful bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.276" offset="3292453">Now this Court's decision in Gerende, the 1951 very brief per curiam decision in Gerende involved Section 15 of the Act, so-called Candidate's Oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.119" offset="3351803">In Gerende, the Court relied upon the Court of Appeals of Maryland's construction of that provision in Shub versus Simpson.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.079" offset="3395688">Perhaps if I could refresh Your Honor's memories with respect to Gerende, in that case you said, “The scope of the state law was passed on -- in Shub".</text>
            <text syncTime="834.444" offset="3441142">We read this decision to hold that to obtain a place on a Maryland ballot for candidate need only make oath that he is not a person who is engaged "in one way or another in the attempt to overthrow the government by force or violation,” and that he is not knowingly a member of an organization engaged in such an attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.556" offset="3517628">At the bar of this Court, the Attorney General of the State of Maryland declared that he would advise the proper authorities to and accept an affidavit in these terms to satisfying in full the statutory requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.008" offset="3563395">Under these circumstances and with this understanding, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.835" offset="3590666">Now appellees insist that the decision in Gerende in effect severs the certification or oath from the statute and insulates it, claimed innocuous on its face as we've just discussed from constitutional attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.744" offset="7506317">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.217" offset="7524289">I should first like to distinguish this interpretation of Elfbrandt that was presented here with respect to the legislative gloss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.930" offset="7583117">Now in Elfbrandt, the reason that legislative gloss became important was that the perjury portion of the statute incorporated within it that the person who is taking the oath shall not knowingly and willfully become or remain a member of the Communist Party, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.403" offset="7669008">This is not the case in the Maryland certification situation because the Maryland perjury statute is simply a criminal statute for making a false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.157" offset="7732015">Now, the words “in one way or another,” we fail to see how these words could possibly give anyone any trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.997" offset="7783320">I mean, in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.122" offset="7791888">Its mere surplusage, its additional language was neither adds to nor takes away from the words or meaning of the oath itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.949" offset="7851133">The Court on a number of occasions has found no constitutional difficulty from the vagueness standpoint in construing the words overthrow the government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.340" offset="7924694">These words have been used in federal statutes such as the Smith Act and the vices of vagueness which has been found in other oaths and other laws and not been found in those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.597" offset="8009749">The oath in Baggett versus Bullitt which was referable to a Washington statute which is identical to that in Maryland is distinguishable also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.998" offset="8071398">In that case, the oath said that, I certify that I'm not a subversive person as defined by the Act and there was no limitation upon the definition of subversive person in that case, in the oath that was taken in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.641" offset="8145899">And so the case of Baggett versus Bullitt does not constitute a precedent for overruling Gerende or making the Maryland oath as presently stated invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.645" offset="11425938">The question of the authority of the Attorney General is apparently still bothering the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.736" offset="11454360">And I should once again try to establish where this authority comes from and how it affects this interpretation of the law here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.178" offset="11496051">Now, this may not be in the brief, but in Article 5, Section 3 of the Maryland constitution, it is stated that the Attorney General shall give his opinion in writing on any legal matter or subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.729" offset="11558327">And in Code Article 32A of the Maryland Annotated Code Section 3, the Attorney General shall have general charge supervision and direction of a legal business of the other state and shall be legal adviser and representative of and perform all legal work for boards, institutions, departments, etcetera of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.693" offset="11642128">Now the University of Maryland of course is a department, an institution or an agency of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.325" offset="11668668">The applicable part of Section 11 of the overact is that every board in this case would be the Board of Regents or other agency of the state which employs --and so forth employee shall establish by rules, regulations or otherwise procedures designed to ascertain before any person is appointed or employed that he or she as the case maybe is not a subversive person and that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that such persons are subversive persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.032" offset="11863542">Now, this is quite similar to the charge in Section 15 which was construed by this Court in Gerende where an affidavit was required for a person who is a candidate for election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.045" offset="11931564">That he is -- he or she is not a subversive person as defined in this Article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.798" offset="11950582">And our argument here is that if the oath prescribed here which was the one that this Court said was sufficient under Gerende can be given under Section 15 that certainly the same oath should be able to be given under Section 11 of the Act.</text>
