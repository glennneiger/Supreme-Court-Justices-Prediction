            <label>Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben</label>
            <text syncTime="28.741" offset="218363">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.972" offset="231215">Mr. Chief Justice, associate justices, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.780" offset="262457">Each time that I have the pleasure of appearing before this Court, I have taken the liberty at the outset of calling the attention of the Court to the fact that I am somewhat hard of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.510" offset="317419">And each time in the past when I have done that Mr. Justice Frankfurter invariably would ask me whether or not I made that statement in order to avoid having the Court ask me any questions and each time, I always replied to Mr. Justice Frankfurter that I'm welcome to questions and that I only make the statement to the end that the Court will bear with me a little if I do not seem to -- at first, to hear what you have to say to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.712" offset="434239">This case Your Honors again, brings to this Court the troublesome question and I say troublesome because it has bothered the Court in the past on three separate occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.162" offset="495992">The question deals with the right to a trial by jury in a criminal contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.327" offset="524727">As the Court will recall, this matter has come before Your Honors in the past as recently as in Cheff v. Schnackenberg, and prior to that in the Barnett case and prior to that in the Green case.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.091" offset="591705">In every instance, the Court has split one way or another and have stated their diverge views with great strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.971" offset="635277">The matter actually comes here now upon the grant of a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois to review a judgment by that court which affirmed a judgment added in the probate court of Cook County against the petitioner who was charged with criminal contempt of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.065" offset="743633">Now the conduct upon which the petitioner was brought to trial in that court related to his alleged filing in the Court of a spurious will, a will alleged in the pleadings to have been prepared by the petitioner subsequent to the death of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.568" offset="829628">The petitioner is a member of the Bar of the State of Illinois actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.982" offset="871320">In the pleading, it is said that he prepared this in his office with the aid of his stenographer that thereafter he procured witnesses who signed it after the death of the decedent that he then filed the will with the clerk, with probate court and that he then presented it for admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.245" offset="964315">When the case came on for trial, we asked for a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.053" offset="987617">Our request for a jury was timely at the Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.649" offset="1006007">The trial judge saw fit to deny that request and the trial was then entered upon and consumed approximately 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.030" offset="1047489">At the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner was found guilty of all of those matters which I have already described to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.814" offset="1086673">And the order recited that he was in delegation of the dignity of the Court and of the orderly processes of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.908" offset="1130977">Also during the trial, a fact issue was raised as to the guilt or innocence of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.884" offset="1170892">That fact issue was raised by the testimony of a psychiatrist who testified that a part of his examination of petitioner and upon a hypothetical question that the petitioner could not possibly have possessed the benevolent intent which is necessary at the State of Illinois to support a charge of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.029" offset="1287502">The portion of this case which makes it somewhat different than the cases which have come to the Court's attention in the past lies in the fact here that the conduct complaint of as pleaded in the petition constitutes a felony under the criminal code of the State of Illinois of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.254" offset="1392410">It constitutes a felony under the provisions of Section 17-3 of that code which to deals with forgery and makes it a felony punishable by a sentence of one to 14 years for one who utters knowingly a forged document.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="346.453" stopTime="562.847">
            <label>Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben</label>
            <text syncTime="346.453" offset="1489168">The petitioner was sentenced to two years in the common jail of Cook County and is presently at large on bail pending his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court and then the grant of certiorari here.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.886" offset="1550921">Now, the case also presents two other constitutional questions which I hope to come to later because I would like to have the main impact of my argument centered on the question of the right to trial by jury in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.096" offset="1623751">But at passing, so that it will come as no surprise to the Court, we also alleged that the trial judge had a secret report furnished him by an amicus curiae who was appointed by him and that this report was only made limitedly available to us at the trial and not at its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.125" offset="1715911">And the third constitutional point deals with the question of a comment by the prosecutor at the conclusion of the summary that the petitioner in that case have failed to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.599" offset="1781739">I do not wish to take up the time of this Court needlessly to explain to the Court that which I know it already knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.816" offset="1830640">I am sure that this Court is much more familiar with the dissent of Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.424" offset="1861047">In fact, the number of dissent of Mr. Justice Black in this field and his presentation of all of the reasons why upon a consideration of ancient law, Magna Carta, the statutes prevailing in the 13 colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.447" offset="1937115">A review of ancient common law English decisions and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.853" offset="1962820">Why he stands for the proposition that there is just no reason in logic why a criminal contempt of any sort should be treated any differently than a crime or a criminal prosecution and therefore subject to Article III, Section 2 of the constitution as well as the Sixth Amendment of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.790" offset="2070549">Elegant treatment has been given to the same subject by Mr. Justice Goldberg in his dissent in the Barnett case and Mr. Justice Douglas from time to time has made references in dissents to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.618" offset="2133870">On the other hand as the Court knows Mr. Justice Harlan has consistently taken a position in opposition to the theory which we now propose.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.051" offset="2179532">But I thought that the basis for Mr. Justice Harlan's opinions in the past is somewhat -- maybe distinguished here since in Green and in Barnett the two cases prior to Cheff, there was never any question of the conduct complained off in those cases constituting a felony as this particular conduct does here.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.708" offset="2306173">As of felony of course, the petitioner might well have been indicted by a grand jury on which event at the Illinois law and under the Illinois constitution, it would have been entitled to a trial by jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.967" offset="2363225">And I thought there was a statute in Green and it was one year penalty but the Court gave him five years for contempt, am I wrong in that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben</label>
            <text syncTime="635.090" offset="2643780">In Cheff, which was the last time these troubles and problem came here, six of the justices seemed for one reason or another to be on the side which I now proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.424" offset="2713057">Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas quite consistently adhered to their prior dissents.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.789" offset="2746493">Four other justices, however, consisting of the Chief Justice I believe, Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Fortas as I recall took the position that where or rather they equate and I should say, a criminal contempt to a petty crime and then taking the petty crime which is defined under the appropriate United States statute, I believe it's 18 U.S.C 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.569" offset="2885674">I found there that the maximum penalty to constitute a petty crime was six months and concluding that upon the equation which I just mentioned that therefore it is constitutionally possible to impose a sentence in a case where a disobedience of the Court order was involved which did not exceed six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.160" offset="2987969">But nevertheless, a caveat was published to the lower courts which in the language of this Court seem to indicate that lower courts could not sentence to more than six months in a criminal contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.310" offset="3072606">And if they intended to sentence for a longer period of time then a jury trial was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.927" offset="3107088">My distinguished adversaries from the State of Illinois take the position that this is not a constitutional finding by this Court and was merely an exercise of the supervisory powers of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.587" offset="3173752">I of course contend the opposite and I say that it would have been impossible for this Court no matter what it called it to have decided the question presented in Cheff without as a matter of logic deciding when the issue of this caveat that any punishment more than six months was unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment and Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.153" offset="3271973">We have briefed this fully as has the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.654" offset="3285974">Now then, it seems also to me as a matter of reasoning that there is just no reason whatsoever why a criminal contempt should ever be considered in any manner different from the ordinary crime or criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.760" offset="3382418">For instance, in the past, this Court as well as the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois had held that a -- an alleged contemnor is entitled to any number of rights all of which are granted to him only in the event of the commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.163" offset="3460054">For instance, under decisions here and under decisions of the State of Illinois an alleged contemnor is entitled to the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.484" offset="3497357">He is entitled to the application of the rule that he must be proved guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, self incrimination is not permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.389" offset="3544900">He has a right to counsel, he has an opportunity to prepare for trial, he must be given notices of the charges against him, he has a right to an impartial arbiter of the facts, he has the benefit of statutes of limitations covering crimes and finally under these decisions, he has the right to petition for pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.491" offset="3641344">It seems to me that there is just no logic to support the theory that a criminal prosecution at any way differs from a crime and more importantly because I do not wish to overstate my own case, more importantly where the conduct charge actually does as it is here does constitute a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.477" offset="3753253">Now, there is another reason which seems to me logically to support our position and that is by an analysis which I will make very briefly of why a court has a contempt power at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.922" offset="3815111">And there are decisions after decisions saying that courts have this power in order to protect themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.487" offset="3849279">That is to protect themselves from insult and contumacy committed in their presence or to enforce their judgments and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.705" offset="3886164">But at the same time, the decisions of this Court and particularly the early decisions that indicate that the power of contempt as they said should be the least power adequate to the end proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.107" offset="3947813">I believe that was in a very early decision of this Court to this case, the Bessette case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.772" offset="4490428">Under the criminal code there, the petty -- crimes are -- consists of misdemeanors and felonies and that is all which is why I would ask in this case, should the Court see fit to go along with our brief that the case be remanded for a new trial rather than for the imposition of any six months sentence as was done in Cheff.</text>
