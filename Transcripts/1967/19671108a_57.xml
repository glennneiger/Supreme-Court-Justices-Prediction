            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="27.060" offset="211571">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.557" offset="229648">This case, number 57, like the next one to be argued, arises under the Labor Reform Law of 1959, more popularly known as the Landrum-Griffin Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.020" offset="283460">Each of these cases involves an election of local offices which allegedly were conducted in violation of the Labor Act and accordingly, must be set aside and rerun under the supervision of the Secretary of Labor and let me first sketch a little bit the scheme of the Act in dealing with this sort of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.524" offset="405504">The relevant provisions of the Act are reproduced in the appendix of the Government's brief and I will refer to them in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.705" offset="442180">First, Section 401 (e), which is on page 57 and 58 of our brief, provides among other things that in the election of local officers, every member in good standing shall have a right to be candidate subject to reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed and shall likewise have a right to vote in elections for local officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.380" offset="560880">The Act then provides that if a member believes that the Section 401 has been violated either because eligible members were denied the right to vote or denied the right to be candidates or on the contrary because ineligible members were permitted to vote or to be candidates, situation in the next case, then after exhausting his internal union remedies, he may complain to the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.321" offset="692642">This is provided for in Section 402 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="151.318" offset="708629">And the next Subsection 402 (b) requires the Secretary upon receiving this complaint from union member to conduct an investigation and if he finds probable cause to believe that there has been a violation of the Title, he is then to file suit in the District Court to set aside the invalid election and to obtain an order allowing him to rerun that election under his supervision or in order to have that election rerun under his supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.228" offset="856273">And finally, Section 402 (c), which was addressed to the District Court itself, directs that Court to enter this order if it finds that there has been a violation of Section 401 and if it further finds that that violation may have affected the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.399" offset="948955">In that event, the Court is directed to set aside the invalid election and to order a rerun under the supervision of the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.450" offset="997125">Now, in this case, number 57, we deal with Local 153 of the Glass Bottle Blowers and its election in October 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.130" offset="1051878">At that time and even today and its likely attenuated for all, the union had a rule imposed both by the international and by the local constitution which provided that only members who had attended 75%, at least 75% of the regular monthly meetings of the local while the previous two years were permitted to vote or to be candidates and that 75% requirement is a rigid one because no excuses for nonattendance were permitted, not even illness, except being at work at the very time of the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.220" offset="1220211">The effect of the rule as it worked in 1963 has -- I'll say later as it continued to work at least two years later -- was to disfranchise and make ineligible as candidates the great majority of the local members.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.082" offset="1299728">Indeed, out of 500 members of this particular local, only 10 were eligible to be candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.715" offset="1342255">The result of the -- I should add that there are 10 offices of the local to be filled which if there were one eligible candidate for each office would result in having only one slate and no contest whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.386" offset="1412890">The actual result in the 1963 election was that there was only one candidate for two of the offices and that there were no candidates whatever for four of the offices who therefore had to be appointed from ineligible members at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.856" offset="1498781">This particular suit arises out of the complaint of a candidate for president who was disqualified under this meeting-attendance rule because he had attended one meeting too few and he had attended 17 meetings in the prior 2 years out of the 24 whereas if he had attended 18, he would have been eligible to be a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.355" offset="1608808">And he missed one meeting at least because he was ill but that was not an excused absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.488" offset="1637334">Now, after unsuccessfully exhausting his internal union remedies he complained to the Secretary, who, after investigating, filed a timely suit in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.040" offset="1687489">The District Court agreed that the meeting attendance requirement, with its rigid rule on excuses, was an unreasonable qualification which violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.216" offset="1740257">Now, although that finding is not disturbed by the Court of Appeals because the Court of Appeals didn't reached the matter, there is some suggestion here that the rule was indeed reasonable and not unreasonable as held by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.285" offset="1800547">We assume that question is open here on the theory that the judgment below can be sustained on any ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.346" offset="1828760">However, it doesn't seem to us necessary to spend much time defending the district judge's ruling on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.042" offset="1871496">It's perfectly clear that the meeting-attendance requirement did disfranchise 98% of the -- did make ineligible as candidates 98% of the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.476" offset="1941295">It's also clear in this case that we have a candidate, a nominee, who was prevented from running on account of this rule, by the implication if this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.981" offset="1999287">It is of course unknown whether had he run, he would have been elected but on the other hand no one can say that he would not have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.219" offset="2028231">Therefore, the invocation of this rule against him which disqualified him may have affected the outcome of the election and that's all the Act requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.376" offset="2072848">There is no requirement that there be a showing that the invocation of the rule in fact affected the outcome of the election or could there be.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.517" offset="2429471">As to the unreasonableness of this rule which left only 2% of the members eligible to be candidates, I would say that it's a rather clear question, if it's one which the union itself has changed recognizing that this didn't even give opportunity for any opponents, it certainly is not consonant with the purpose of the Landrum-Griffin Act to provide for union democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.462" offset="2577220">Elections are meaningless under a system which results in having only 10 candidates eligible for 10 offices.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="843.557" offset="3477608">I think that fact that can be empirically determined by the people in the Labor Department without the necessary being accurate statistics on the detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.948" offset="3535182">Now, the District Court, although finding this qualification unreasonable in what seems to us a surprising turnabout then said, however, this rule may not -- did not affect the outcome of this election because our men was free to attend one more meeting which -- as to which he has no valid excuse and therefore that wasn't the rule that disqualified him, it was his own voluntary deliberate act in absenting himself from additional meeting; that it seems to us that two can play the game, we can with equal force say that it was that aspect of the rule that failed to give him credit of the meeting he missed on account of illness that disqualified him.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.938" offset="3747088">If he had been given credit for the meeting, he would have had 18 present marks and therefore would be qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.093" offset="3775718">Seems plain to us, therefore, that this rule did affect the disqualification of this candidate which in turn are, as I've already noted, might well have affected the outcome of the election because he might well have prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.905" offset="3850951">No one knows but it is efficient that that might have been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.798" offset="3914585">Upon this finding that there was no effect on outcome, the District Court dismissed the Secretary's suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.565" offset="3945618">By this time, it was August of 1965 this particular union has two-year elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.505" offset="3969442">We were talking about the October 1963 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.274" offset="3984488">New election was scheduled for October 1965, a month and a half after the District Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.877" offset="4014895">In view of this, the District Court retained jurisdiction to allow the Secretary to challenge the new election, a disposition which it later regretted and in effect withdrew.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.347" offset="4072782">The Secretary appealed, but by that time, new elections had into being and the Court of Appeals remanded the case to allow for opposed judgment application challenging the intervening election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.360" offset="4148851">However, on remand, the District Judge said, “It's true that I suggested that you might challenge this new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.199" offset="4184168">However, there's no indication again that there's any effect on outcome resulting from this rule which has been applied again in this new election in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.326" offset="4248639">Therefore, I will deny you relief”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.077" offset="4259715">Again, the Secretary appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.175" offset="4272044">This time, the Third Circuit held that the challenge to the 1965 election, supervening election, must fail because there had been no complaint from the union member with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.978" offset="4331290">Therefore, the Secretary had no -- have already filed suit challenging it and the Court had no jurisdiction to enter any order with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.507" offset="4373400">As to the challenge to the 1963 election, the Third Circuit following the Second Circuit case which you'll hear much about, the engineer's dispute, said that that is moot, that 1963 election has been washed out by the 1965 elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.590" offset="4457723">There is no relief which can be afforded with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.878" offset="4474859">Therefore, the case ought to be dismissed as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.124" offset="4503907">Now, the principal issue, as the case as presented here, is precisely that holding of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.163" offset="4544031">The holding being that the Secretary's challenge to an election which has been in some sense superseded by an intervening election must be viewed as abated, mooted, as washed out by the occurrence of that new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.825" offset="4622712">The rationale seemingly of the Second Circuit in the Engineer's case, the Third Circuit here, or the Sixth Circuit and the next case beyond it, is that the only remedy provided by the Act when there has been election violation is to set aside the invalid election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.245" offset="4712364">And then once that election has already been set aside by the occurrence of a new election in due course, there is nothing further, no further relief, no further remedy which the Court could usefully enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.492" offset="4773386">Therefore, the case is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.161" offset="4788015">That rationale, of course, logically applies whether or not the intervening election is equally tainted, be intervening that you can't go back to the election but you can supersede it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.813" offset="4850604">It's equally superseded whether it's -- the intervening election is clean or tainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.118" offset="4883832">In principle also, the holding of mootness would reach a prematurely held election by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.450" offset="4921135">All the union need do under these rulings, to prevent the Secretary from obtaining any relief is to rerun an election which has been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.972" offset="4971290">Rerun it without supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.480" offset="4981321">Rerun it with or without eliminating the irregularity which provoked or challenged previous election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.336" offset="5360724">Then there were 60 days during which the Secretary investigates, if during that period, a new election is run, so as to cleanse the effects of the old one, no supervision is necessary and the union will successfully moot any court challenge, any intrusion by the Secretary of Labor which this so much complained about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.264" offset="5600423">Most of the argument here from the outside is directed against the disruption of union affairs, the intrusion of the Secretary of the Government into internal union matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.275" offset="6180446">For whatever reasons, then we think those reasons are important and quite obvious, the Congress thought the laboratory election a necessary part of the remedy and it is a part of the remedies that remains available even though there is no tainted election to be set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.816" offset="6970598">Let me conclude only by saying that the finding of a violation of Title IV is a prerequisite to an order directing a supervised election, a laboratory election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.213" offset="7044263">But the availability of an order to set aside the invalid election is not a prerequisite to the direction of a laboratory election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.610" offset="7785827">These two cases, numbers 57 and 58 are the first cases before the Court dealing with Title IV of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.356" offset="7816756">They raised three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.463" offset="7825220">Does a second regularly scheduled election held vague and moot a suit by the Secretary to set aside a prior election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.678" offset="7862105">And does the meaning of the requirements contained in Section 402 (c) of the Act that in order to set aside an election, the Secretary must prove that the alleged violation may have had an effect to the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.575" offset="7917693">And third, whether the Secretary has cart launch to raise issues all of those that the union members has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.386" offset="7940890">As to the last, that is not in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.665" offset="7949981">It will be in the next following case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.001" offset="7967326">Our position is that as to all these three issues, the Secretary is attempting to expand the very limited authority conferred upon him by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.659" offset="8009958">At the start, it is well connoted that these contested issues are merely the visible portion of the iceberg with beneath of which lies the great statutory inhibitions that affect the operation of unions as placed upon them under the 1959 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.358" offset="8088848">It is clear that Congress gave the Secretary authority to Act in this instance as the union members' lawyer as stated by the senators and the late Senator Kennedy in that regard, and I will refer to it later, the original draft of the bill that was introduced, that account was specifically made and remains throughout the text of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.415" offset="8185083">In this role, the Secretary has the authority under Section 402 of the Act to seek an election challenged by a union member, who has exhausted his internal remedies, set aside on the ground raised by the member if he can prove that the election was invalid and the invalidity may have affected the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.668" offset="8270033">Moreover, he has a broad authority under Section 601 continuously to investigate union elections or any other union affairs and report his findings to the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.230" offset="8316322">This basic authority, while it is circumscribed worth a revolution in the amount of allowable governmental intervention into intenal union affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.578" offset="8357700">Thus, there can be no doubt that if the respondents prevail in this Court, the Government's supervisory increase in the powers over union, elections will still be quite considerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.168" offset="8408064">The real question presented is whether the supervising power will be limited as Congress intended or unlimited as the Secretary wishes it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.841" offset="8454771">Both the statutory language and the legislative history indicate that Congress intended to give the Secretary limited and very limited power in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.464" offset="8497194">The drafters and supporters of Title IV recognized that the public interest in union democracy required a balancing between preservation of the union autonomy and membership control of their organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.002" offset="8559365">On the one hand, and the Government in support on the other, as the majority report of the Senate Labor Committee stated, and I'd like to refer to page 21 of the amicus brief, “Given the maintenance of minimum democratic safeguards and detailed essential information about the union, the individual members are fully competent to regulate union affairs”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.007" offset="8675349">The committee strongly opposes any attempt to prescribe detailed procedural -- procedures and standards for the conduct of union business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.455" offset="8713174">Such paternalistic regulation would weaken rather than strengthen the labor movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.952" offset="8731146">It would crossover into the area of trading and licensing and destroyed union independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.259" offset="8784436">As we proceed through the facts in this case, gentlemen of the Court, we find that there is a remarkable absence of predicate where the Secretary is concerned about the affairs of this and other trade unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.938" offset="8851101">May I first bring to the Court's attention the fact that, in response to the question by Justice Fortas, that there was a very substantial and almost immediate strong effort made to correct or let's say modify the rule as indicated by the trial judge in his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.093" offset="8927796">The facts briefly are in that area; that Judge Dumbauld rendered his decision on August 26th, 1965 with the local union's election being scheduled for early October 2nd, Tuesday I believe or Thursday in October, that the local union had already, under its constitutional requirements set forth in so-called constitutional bylaws had one nomination meeting early in August, and the second nomination meeting in September, and eligibility had already been determined under the then validly existing rule because the statute states specifically that the union's election in its procedures are considered valid unless changed and until changed by a court decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.755" offset="9310438">The rule was the same, sir, insofar as we know but was in the process of being changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.459" offset="9333217">That's all I could say as to the best of my knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.322" offset="9348681">My deep concern is a matter of the cause my intimate relationship with them, and I watched this matter for progressed and perhaps would like to proceed in that specific fashion if you will forgive me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.005" offset="9391417">We were deeply concerned and I speak I am sure for all labor when the Secretary advances the position that absent a complaint by a member, and that's what the Third Circuit Court indicated or stated, that the Secretary has a right to walk into a local union and conduct another election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.861" offset="9474800">Now, there's a very interesting factual background here that I say, this is my personal knowledge, that the Secretary should know, that there were some 30 odd members of the local union in the courtroom when this case was being tried at the request of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.664" offset="9550033">The only witness that the Secretary brought forth was the complainant himself and the Secretary sought to it that the decision of Judge Dumbauld was spread over the newspapers in that small community of Washington, Pennsylvania because I saw these copies myself, as well as in the Pittsburgh papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.787" offset="9626520">And the entire community, which is composed substantially of Glass Workers was well aware what was going on as early as August 1965, we have the Judge Dumbauld decision and I say this with true humbleness, based upon experience, that in my opinion, the membership was satisfied with that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.335" offset="9704678">I say that most meaningfully because no -- not only because no complaint came forth but in another case, it is -- this rule has been used by members to deliberately avoid candidacy because he didn't want to be put in a position of turning down candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.456" offset="9765177">However, that's on the side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.518" offset="9769462">Let me say, as a matter of fact, as the record shows, there was no member who came forth to complain about this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.499" offset="9809377">I -- the Secretary attempts to meet our argument by stating that once an allegedly unlawful election takes place, he must have the authority to ave a rerun election, to remove the taint of the prior election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.706" offset="9870190">In other words, he suggests that he has broad regulatory powers that would entitle him to set aside a presumptively valid election, even if he can't meet the burden of proof that the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.465" offset="9929226">For the reasons I have outlined, we believe that the Secretary's argument indicates that he is seeking to push to one side, the delicate balance Congress struck in order to broaden his powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.330" offset="9976665">And as has been stated in other decisions, vying to this very important constitutional question, the lesson of his pre-teaches that the enlargement of a particular power, however, in that one all too frequently that leads to abuse and disastrous consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.008" offset="10047404">And I say most meaningfully, Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen, that the facts of this case show that the very purpose that this Act intended was being fully met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.960" offset="10095261">In 1963, the election in question was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.514" offset="10113442">In due course, the matter was reached the stage of litigation and disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.894" offset="10138937">Prior to the holding of the hearing in this case, meetings were held with the Secretary of Labor as subsequent to the decision, meetings continued to be held and as stated in the record on page -- page 58, “In June 1966, after meetings were held with the Secretary personally by the President Minton of International Union, not a slight variation of this rule was dealt with but spelt out before you a very substantial number of excuse areas wherein instilled in this rule to a point where it gives every member an opportunity used for almost any reasonable occurrence that might take away from the union meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.582" offset="10341752">Now, before I proceed further, let me again point out, as we did in our brief, that when the Government -- when the Secretary started to process this matter, there were two important questions that were to be resolved, one was, by stipulation modeled by Judge Dumbauld himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.116" offset="10411865">By stipulation, the Secretary agreed that the purpose of the rule was laudable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.399" offset="10432972">It was a desirable rule that had for its purpose, not only membership attendance but equal as important or more important a background of knowledge on how a local union functions by anyone of the sought candidacy, that where a raw recruit come in without that background would be and has proven to be disastrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.461" offset="10501204">That is by agreement with the Government that such was the purpose of the rule that was passed in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.095" offset="10527744">And secondly, in the colloquy between Mr. Wyner, counsel for the Secretary and Judge Dumbauld at the pre-trial conference which is part of the record, he stated specifically that there was no venality connected with this whole proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.703" offset="10578213">There was no charge of wrongdoing on the part of the unions' officers, but only that there was a rule which the Secretary considered unreasonable because of the numbers game that was being played.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.770" offset="10622412">May I further say that there are at least 15 or 16 or may be 17 international unions based upon the Secretary's own statistics that have membership requirement attendance such as ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.809" offset="10670582">There are only -- there were only two at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.186" offset="10676120">It was 75% but again, there was 50% attendance and so forth, majority were 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.996" offset="10699316">So it's not a question of 50% or 75% or attendance requirements as to numbers of meeting that was at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.412" offset="11328972">First, because of what has been said by the Circuit Courts of Appeals in part and a combination of a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.220" offset="11352273">A -- the union's elections are held periodically and specifically have to be held periodically according to constitution and by laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.363" offset="11384874">The Secretary volunteered a statement on the footnote in his brief that there were approximately three-and-a-half million union members whose elections are held either no -- more frequently than once a year or once every two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.940" offset="11451120">There are approximately 17 million members at least putting the figure very modestly under in members of unions who presumably have terms of office for their offices of three years, which is the maximum allowed under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.084" offset="11507754">Of the three-and-a-half million, approximately 50% or more are under the two-year rule, the same as are the international unions -- local union's requirements are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.799" offset="11546520">Now, if the Secretary -- if the Secretary were to proceed with the dispatch available to them under the direction of the Circuit Court's judgments, after the seventh month from the holding of the election and the making, the rising of the complaint, the Secretary is first before the Courts and he goes through the process of appearing on a summary calendar, have this matter litigated long before the expiration maybe of a set two year term as certainly much longer before the expiration of the three-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.149" offset="11679953">So this “laboratory” election with the word, Mr. (Inaudible) is applies to these proceedings as no connection with any Labor Board proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.624" offset="11713912">He would have his election within that one year or the two years or whatever it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.733" offset="11734288">There's nothing to stop the Secretary from moving promptly which he has yet to failed to do, he even put the Circuit Court of Appeals recommendations to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.010" offset="11771382">I say that with all sincerity, we evaluated this by calendar and by review and by applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.070" offset="11799698">We strongly feel that the Secretary would have an election directed by the Court if the rule was found to be invalid or whatever the procedure was before the expiration of the thn existing term of laws he has under attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.817" offset="11862601">But to say that sometime in the future he has a right to come into a second election, absent any complaint by a member and to proceed on the basis of what the findings might have been in the first election without all the peripheral questions that arise as to whether it was positively applied or whether people actually got their excuses, at least -- at least the Secretary had a right that does not appear in the statute and anywhere either by inference or direction or by conclusion certainly as directly opposite to the entire history that the legislative discussions show us to be existent in this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.174" offset="12212120">It does not go with that kind of public interest that the Secretary chooses to qualify himself because as pointed out in this case, the very facts in this case show that we moved with all dispatch to clear up this matter and met Judge Dumbauld's recommendations after long colloquy with the Secretary and his associates, I personally participated some of them, that we could get nowhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.312" offset="12296652">The Secretary of Labor in his response to Judge -- to Mr. Minton's letter in August of 1966, said in effect no rule is satisfactory to be contrary to what Judge Dumbauld said, what kind of a laboratory election could we have where the Secretary himself would not even be willing to abide by Judge Dumbauld's decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.104" offset="12383796">So we reached an anomalous situation everywhere which we way we turn about using and applying the broad spectrum of the Secretary's wishes to the facts at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.483" offset="12425279">We could only deal with the case as we find it not presuppose or assume facts that don't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.604" offset="12449834">To a large as local union -- these rules to include any number of excuses plus an assurance of a group of candidates under any circumstances, at the time when the Secretary had made it known to his own publications that he certainly could not find “with the 50% rule” that was in existent part of the Secretary's published handbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.473" offset="12537292">That leaves us deeply concerned with this suggestion for laboratory election at that time when there's no complaint, the union presumably has done or is doing things it should be doing in the opinion of the Secretary and validly elective officers being disturbed in their term by an election like this now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.983" offset="12619316">There is another -- this is now the second intervening election having taken place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.606" offset="13805798">Of course, you don't have to reach that point if you find that the mootness position taken by the Circuit Courts of Appeals has to be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.846" offset="13846758">Now, in this case, as we know for reading of the record in Judge Dumbauld's decision, this rule was not held to be unreasonable as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.294" offset="13880508">It was only as with respect to the excused areas that were limited that may be application out of it under those particular circumstances, and his opinion unreasonable, with substantial suggestions on how it could be corrected in his opinion which I indicated was followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.572" offset="13937664">Now, in this instance, it held that the Secretary must show that a willing candidate was disqualified by the illegal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.457" offset="13981236">This is the Secretary was unable to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.069" offset="13991685">The only evidence he had or was introduced was that one candidate and only one candidate was disqualified by the 75% rule because he was absent a meeting in which it was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.232" offset="14036302">That candidate, gentlemen, Chief Justice and Justices of the Court, was the treasurer of the local union who had founded very convenient and easy to qualify for the 1959 election which he won as treasurer, the 1961 election in which he won as treasurer, and when he absented himself from a number of meetings in spite of his responsibilities as the treasury report of the financial affairs of the local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.157" offset="14151973">As a matter of fact, unfortunately as it may be, this gentlemen proved to be something less than truthful before the Court and the areas of excuse that he told the Government he was entitled to receive when he reported to the Secretary in his complaint and which he intended which he testified to the Court as being the areas of absence were periods of time when he claimed to be ill but which he -- which, by the record, he usually had attended the union meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.740" offset="14254373">So that -- as Judge Dumbauld very properly found that he had the opportunity to observe the witness and the demeanor of the witness and all the facts, he found himself an individual who for reasons he never explained and could not explain, did not come to six meetings that were easily available to him at the time when he should have come as an officer, though that may not be the criteria, that's the whole factual picture here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.051" offset="14363564">We find ourselves that the -- we find ourselves that the -- there was nobody else complaining that the candidate did not have a valid excuse for not coming to a sufficient number of meetings and that there was not a willing candidate who was disqualified by virtue of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.925" offset="14447052">The fact support that position amply and completely, and that we have no basis in fact or in law for the setting aside of this election on the ground that it affected the outcome, that the events that occurred affected the outcome of the election insofar as the complainant was concerned and suddenly the Secretary could have as to the extent of investigatory powers have ascertained as there are any other persons who are similarly affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.283" offset="14560528">May I close on this note and this is most meaningful for me because I was exposed to it as early -- or as recently as April this year when in a similar case, a very fine person testifying before a District Court judge testify -- stated that when she was asked why she had did not qualify or was not eligible for office, said that she deliberately absented herself from meetings and didn't seek an excuse so that she would not be called upon to stand for candidacy and turn her people down because she had too many, she was a married woman and had home problems and just didn't want to disappoint her friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.078" offset="14711724">This is her testimony before the Court and I say to you, we cannot unless we delve into these -- the background of these facts ascertain whether the 490 people, members of local of -- local union wanted to be candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.878" offset="14766895">I am sure, I can close this meaningfulness this by stating to you from my personal experience and I'm sure from statistics that were available that a huge majority of cases, trade union elections find themselves where there are no office or position for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.825" offset="14830634">There are no opposing candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.246" offset="14836381">There were any number of elections so that whether -- the mere fact that there are 10 candidates under our rule or only ten candidate because of a single candidacy position and itself does not prove impropriety of the election.</text>
