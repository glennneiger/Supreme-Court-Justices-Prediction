            <text syncTime="31.859" offset="230797">Honorable Chief Justice I regret that my talents of narrative and description are probably not quite equal to the teller Mrs. Hanner and I think would've been more appropriate if her pleadings have perhaps been written by Charles Dickens.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.261" offset="288371">Mrs. Hanner attempted to secure divorce in Maricopa County, Phoenix, Arizona and the 1959, these proceedings were held as a result of the somewhat complicated property situation, the trial court evidently felt that it was not equal to the accounting practices required and appointed a special master.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.289" offset="368515">The respondent herein Cecil Demarcus to assist the court in determining what her property was, how she had acquired it and therefore what property might be considered her property and what the community property of herself and her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.747" offset="434343">The Court decided in the spring of 1959 that the special master's report would be accepted and there's this customarily and accordance with Rule 53 (a) of our rules which is of course the duplicate of the federal rules to award him a fee in the amount of approximately $5500.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.950" offset="511143">It's stated at that time that if this fee were not paid by Mrs. Hanner and they charged entirely to her within 60 days that he could have execution therefore in accordance with the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.208" offset="660250">60 days is also the time limit for an appeal in Arizona and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.316" offset="696613">The record as we play with some facts to the effect that Mrs. Hanner's counsel and this particular CBA were practicing in the same small law building or small office building in Phoenix, Arizona that they saw each of the constantly that no reference was made by him to the fact that he might be proceeding by way of execution and by one affidavit in the record by Mrs. Hanner herself to the effect that she was affirmatively advised by him that he would wait the results of the appeal of the divorce action before any steps would be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.032" offset="831509">This is not particularly a natural in view of the fact that she did appeal to the Supreme Court of Arizona, the Court's decision that she had to pay the entire amount of the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.712" offset="878216">She did not object to the actual dollars and cents just to the fact that her husband was not required to pay any of it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.221" offset="916250">In September of 1959, Mr. Demarcus without any notice caused the writ of execution to be issued out of the clerk's office delivered to the sheriff in Maricopa County and levied upon her real properties certain portions of it four lots located in a commercial street in Phoenix, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.764" offset="990438">The method of levy is set forth in our statute and noticed in our brief that is simply by filing a copy of the writ of execution with the county recorder, this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.106" offset="1039757">There is a requirement that execution sales be advertised.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.009" offset="1055431">This was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.165" offset="1060028">Three copies were pointed on the bulletin boards of the courthouse at Maricopa County.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.446" offset="1081135">I assume the members of the Court have seen courthouse bulletin boards and are aware the general condition this is no better or worst than any other, they're hundreds of notices posted on the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.592" offset="1121782">Notice was published in a weekly paper which is devoted almost exclusively and entirely to legal notices, reprints of exact articles have been corporation probate proceedings about a hundred page is about 85 must be solid legal advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.373" offset="1184893">Mr. Demarcus brought the property, entered execution sale for the amount of his judgment plus some dollars which apparently were cost in connection with the execution and perhaps interest from the time of the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.891" offset="1370885">This is an older requirement but it is not followed in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.711" offset="1386245">We do have a requirement of statute which of some interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.896" offset="1402964">A law state that a sheriff on an execution must levy upon personal property before he levies upon real property and a writ of general execution and that was the writ that was issued in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.772" offset="1458448">Mr. Hanner as special master knew that his now judgment credit better had personal property the value maybe in dispute but it was certainly there and may very well have been an excess his judgment as a CPA with knowledge of all her books and records to a greater extent than even a lawyer would know.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.658" offset="1530023">He knew how much property she had and what it was worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.448" offset="1549145">The law requires also that a judgment better may point out to the levying officer the property he desires to be levied on it and if the officer then deems it's sufficient to satisfy the execution, you shall make levy on no other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.443" offset="1617168">Mr. Demarcus also knew by reason of his position as special master that she had other lots of real property available in the county maybe worth more maybe less, some incumbent some not incumbent.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.355" offset="1664815">Actually, on this particular piece of property, two other parties showed up as having an interest in it or it was, we don't know they never defend the quiet title action so evidently they didn't think it was much.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.345" offset="1712776">After bidding this in at the execution sale, he waited for something like two years before any further proceedings were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.855" offset="1742764">During all this time, the original divorce action was still pending in the Arizona Supreme Court and the question of whether or not she should pay the entire fee or whether it should be divided between her and her husband entire fee for Mr. Demarcus and still been ultimately unresolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.432" offset="6977076">But let us examine the context in which the issue was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.858" offset="6990764">Petitioner contends that the statutes of Arizona provide actual notice within the purview of the Schroeder decision and within the purview of the Constitution of United States and I flatly argue this according to their reply brief at page six.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.605" offset="7073834">We wish to reiterate that we are not asking this Court to declare any statutes or rule of State of Arizona invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.330" offset="7104658">We believe that these statutes properly applied would provide sufficient notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.647" offset="7122004">The point is, however, that no notice was in fact provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.892" offset="7138931">Now, in what way do the petitioners alleged that the notice is required to that we go to the opening brief, on page 13, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.158" offset="7188041">And when is the notice -- when is the requirement of notice arise, I'm quoting now on page 13 of the opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.655" offset="7213955">We believe it arises from the statutory requirement that a debtor be allowed to point out to the sheriff property he desires to be levied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.346" offset="7248750">We can well imagine how a legislature after enacting such a statute would go home well satisfied and the belief that no real property could be seized without the judgment debtor is being aware of the levy and execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.328" offset="7304652">Petitioner is contending that the statutes of Arizona are constitutional provide actual notice within the Schroeder -- within the purview of the Schroeder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.483" offset="7341328">Their chief argument is that this statute was not followed by the sheriff in his levy upon the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.643" offset="7401932">That argument, that precise argument, that constitutionality was denied due process was denied by the failure of the sheriff to comply with the admittedly constitutional statutes of Arizona was never, never once raised in the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona until the motion for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.012" offset="7495450">This was the first time that the petitioner contended that no notice was given before that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.092" offset="7523767">Initially before the Supreme Court of Arizona, they contended that that Rule 53 (a) which allows execution in the particular case of the master ought to require notice and that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.739" offset="7850297">The notice of petitioner was entitled to, was notice provided by Arizona statutory scheme, namely that the sheriff upon being told to levy execution should go to the debtor and ascertain the debtor's preferences as to the property upon which execution should be levied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.818" offset="8202637">Rule 53 (a) and the notice of which we are here involved are two entirely different issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.206" offset="8232208">The notice with which we are here involved is the notice required by execution statutes, that petitioner refers to and which the sheriff must present to the judgment debtor the opportunity to point out his personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.630" offset="8297932">The notice referred to in the Supreme Court's opinion was that within the context of Rule 53 (a) which states that if the stat -- if the money is not paid to the master -- master's fee is not paid within the time set by the Court then execution -- without, pardon me, after proper notice, it's what it says then execution may issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.219" offset="8400227">Now, in the Supreme Court, the constitutional argument presented by petitioner was that this "notice" in that statute meant notice of the execution rather than notice of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.931" offset="8451114">And further that if the state court did no so construe the statute it would violate Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.326" offset="8480684">That is the only constitutional question that was presented to the Supreme Court of Arizona and the only constitutional question upon which they decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.476" offset="8509315">They flatly stated that a clear reading of the statute immediately reveals that notice means notice of the judgment which was certainly given in this case and not notice of the execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.523" offset="8561455">Petitioner's argument in that regard it seems to me to be wholly frivolous in the sense that it would be somewhat illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.369" offset="8588831">Petitioner having already conceded that the execution statutes do demand actual notice, it would be if somewhat illogical now to argue that the master's statutes ought to provide an additional notice and indeed in their reply brief they don't -- not so much has mentioned this argument that is the context of 53 (a) as demanding notice seems to have been dropped from the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.732" offset="8690291">Now, they seem to say that somehow despite the fact that the proper context was not presented to this Court, despite the fact that they never argue to the Supreme Court that its statute relative to the sheriff's presenting of this opportunity to the judgment debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.536" offset="8749537">Despite the fact that there was never mentioned until the motion for rehearing and despite the fact that it was never passed upon or decided by the Supreme Court, petitioner wants this Court to find that there was something unconstitutional about this with the complete lack of context.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.296" offset="9392567">Indeed, Blasingame versus Wallace says everything that the petitioner suggests that it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.542" offset="9417540">It says that if a sheriff does not comply with his duty, if he does not give to the judgment debtor the opportunity to point out his property then the execution is defective and it will be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.691" offset="9462157">Therefore, petitioner is correct when he alleges -- when she alleges that this particular portion of the Arizona statutes do require actual notice and do provide the debtor with an opportunity to know what's happening to his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.361" offset="9516805">So Blasingame versus Wallace is right on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.155" offset="9527986">I would suggest to the Court that had Blasingame versus Wallace been raised at the Superior Court level in this case, in the motion for summary judgment there might then have been a question of fact relative to whether or not sheriff performed his duty and a record thereon and that the Supreme Court at that time might have denied motion for summary judgment and tried this case precisely on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.908" offset="9627042">It never was presented to the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.039" offset="9635506">Blasingame versus Wallace was never cited to the Superior Court and the Superior Court therefore have no record nor opportunity to factually investigate this or to make a record upon this issue and precisely the same thing occurred in the Supreme Court of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.599" offset="9697782">Blasingame versus Wallace was never cited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.968" offset="9719202">The argument was never made and the sheriff did not comply his duty and that is the precise argument that petitioner today in this Court relies upon to provide the constitutional deprivation which he seeks this Court to a judge existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.901" offset="11618931">And I assure this Court that such is not true for the gentlemen who sit upon that Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3832.270" offset="15432495">Well, it comes a point I suppose when the violation of a particular state is sufficient gravity to say that due process has been violated but basically yes that when the state establishes a denominator it must adhere to it however low or high the common denominator maybe and that the violation of that is for that citizen the violation the due process and which this Court may take notice and may not because the grounds may not be serious but it is a possibility and it can so act.</text>
