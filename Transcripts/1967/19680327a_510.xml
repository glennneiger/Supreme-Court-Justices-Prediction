            <text syncTime="12.230" offset="152325">Mr. Ligtenberg, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Ligtenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="19.719" offset="182209">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.071" offset="199659">This case has considerable similarity to the one that you heard yesterday afternoon from Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.487" offset="233305">Marvin Pickering was dismissed by the Board of Education of Lockport, Illinois because he wrote a letter to the -- which is published in the local paper in which he criticized the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.622" offset="285863">All other reasons for his dismissal are excluded in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.230" offset="304253">The only question therefore before you is precisely a First Amendment question.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.943" offset="331107">The public high school Board of Lockport, Illinois had over a period of years faced the usual growing problems that had been common in the last numbers of years in that prior of the country and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.882" offset="394951">In 1962, it had presented a bond issue to the purpose of erecting a public high school, a new public high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.878" offset="426924">That bond issue lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.033" offset="439463">Same -- later that same year with some revisions and plans and with other arguments in favor of the new school building, a larger bond issue for five and half million dollars was presented to the voters and that bond issue passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.643" offset="509994">The situation then continued or until about 1964 when the Board decided that it needed more money and a higher tax rate to run the school -- the high schools of that district and it presented a tax rate referendum to the Board of Education -- to the people of that community some time in the Spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.529" offset="593481">That tax referendum lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.015" offset="607483">Later in -- another one was offered, another tax rate referendum was offered in September.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.517" offset="633396">And on September 22nd or 19th rather, that referendum was voted upon and it lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.510" offset="669445">Marvin Pickering was a teacher in that high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.832" offset="686686">He is a science teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.130" offset="695881">He had been attending meetings of the Board of Education for the last two years until he was not only familiar with their problems but also knew the reasons why they were having trouble getting their message across to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.914" offset="746977">Therefore, he wrote a letter which he submitted to the Editor of the Lockport Herald on about the 22nd of September just three days after the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.819" offset="786683">And that letter at his request was published in the Lockport Herald on -- in the issue of September 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.988" offset="819284">On October 8, just two weeks later, the Board of Education voted to dismiss him.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.824" offset="842689">Now, I perhaps want to spend a little time going into some of the allegations of that letter a little bit later.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="192.027" stopTime="196.328">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="192.027" offset="871528">May I ask, was he given a hearing of any kind, a trial or?</text>

          <turn speaker="john_ligtenberg" startTime="196.328" stopTime="316.660">
            <label>Mr. John Ligtenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="196.328" offset="888665">Yes he was Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.596" offset="893785">He was a tenure teacher under the laws of Illinois, have served with probationary period and under that he was entitled to notice and a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.296" offset="924505">He did get notice, and he received the hearing and it was after that the Board voted to dismiss him.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.415" offset="957001">That was subsequently taken to the Circuit Court of that county under the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Review Act and thus again finally thus -- as to the Supreme Court of Illinois and then finally here of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.694" offset="1018128">Of course we are here because he lost at each of those three stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.950" offset="1039130">The charges against him on page 10 -- of the -- page -- Volume 1 of the appendix and while I don't want to read them all, I just want to advert to some of the high spots in these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.169" offset="1112064">That -- it starts on page nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.246" offset="1124394">It says he wrote a letter which -- and that in this letter without justification he questioned and impugned the motives, honesty, integrity, truthfulness, responsibility and competence of this Board of Education and the school administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.696" offset="1182177">And then continued a little further, he says he is seriously involved by this letter and damaged the professional reputations of the administrators and the Board and the reputations of the schools of this district and are and will be highly disruptive to the discipline of the teachers and the moral and harmony among the teachers, administrators, Board of Education and residents of this district and that these comments will tend to ferment controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.956" offset="1283218">Please note Your Honors that nothing is said here about its disrupting the educational process in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.954" offset="1311222">Nothing was said here that there was anything in this charge -- there's nothing in these charges that said this is going to reach down and harm the children who are attending this school.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.575" offset="1341628">It mentions citizens, administrators, Board members, and that's all.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.319" offset="1400665">I just -- they just -- I think that it's important in that one sense because later on as I saw the case at that time and I tried it there, if they had been able to prove that there had been any real incitement to riot, or something like that among the students maybe that would have in my judgment at that time affected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.763" offset="1494392">But nothing at that time was charged and I might add some of the questions that asked now that not one word of evidence was ever offered to the affect that any disruption of any kind ever took place either in the school itself or among the faculty or among the Board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.755" offset="1562415">I assume the Board members got disrupted though by -- they wouldn't have made the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.653" offset="1577984">But there was absolutely no evidence of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.832" offset="1586657">It was simply assumed that the speaking or writing of these words whether the thing that caused the damage to such an extent that he had to be fired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.494" offset="5157386">The indictment that Mr. Pickering was making of the Board is that they were not able to get the message to the tax payers clearly enough to pass the tax rate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.480" offset="5201272">That in prior dealings with the public they didn't get the message as to the building bond programs so that when they came to this issues, the public had gathered distrust and then in formulating his premises to support his argument that the Board no longer had the trust of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.608" offset="5281834">He used rather illogical approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.753" offset="5294373">Now he categorized the initial failure of the building program as a breach of promise by the Board of Education because in the initial program, the Board represented that there would be no frills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.623" offset="5349857">The frills that he had referenced to were a football field, athletic field, auditorium and swimming pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.194" offset="5380159">Now the initial program that the Board had proposed to the public was a tutor school, a two-year school plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.314" offset="5408580">When the voters voted this down, the entire plan was scrapped and a new program developed six or eight months later that was presented to the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.086" offset="5443688">This program provided for a 4-year school on side of the -- the district is divided by waterways, Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.400" offset="5484962">And the Board proposed to construct this west side high school as a four-year school because a considerable amount of the population was located west of this waterway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.715" offset="5530206">A second school was proposed under this bond issue to be located on the east side of the river, but this was to be a two-year school so in constructing the west side school, the Board did put in its plans and it was publicized that an auditorium and an athletic field would be built but no swimming pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.034" offset="5607528">Now Mr. Pickering took all of this maze of activity spreading over the two-year period writing his letters and says that the Board was guilty of a breach of promise to the taxpayer.</text>
