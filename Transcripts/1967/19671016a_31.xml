            <label>Mr. Lucian Y. Ray</label>
            <text syncTime="23.336" offset="196733">Mr. Chief Justice, and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.481" offset="221288">Two cases are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.744" offset="234350">They were consolidated by the District Court for the purpose of disposing of motions for summary judgment and motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.486" offset="273324">All of these motions filed by the respondents below and the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.407" offset="297044">Each of the cases, if the Court please, involve vessels which sank in the Mississippi River in March 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.273" offset="336436">The facts is to each of accidents are not complicated and with the Court's permission, I'd like to briefly review them.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.886" offset="366947">One case involves the barge Wycom 112 which was being towed up the Mississippi River with 1000 tons of liquid chlorine and when the tow got to about seven miles below Natchez, Mississippi that vessel sank.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.590" offset="449703">The vessel owner attempted to locate the barge was unsuccessful in doing so, tendered abandonment to the Core of engineers, that abandonment was at first rejected and then later on the Court through the District Engineer at Vicksburg, Colonel Edward accepted the abandonment and advised the Wyandotte that the barge would be removed under the provisions of Section 19 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.867" offset="606856">If the Court is interested in the full letter, it appears on pages 42 and 43 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.637" offset="665893">After the abandonment had been accepted, the Core of engineers together with other agencies of the government, raised the barge without a loss of any of the chlorine, the chlorine was taken back to Gainesville, Louisiana where it was pumped into tanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.966" offset="731199">The government filed a liable against the three petitioners in that case seeking the recovery of a little over $3 million for the cost of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.846" offset="790758">Now, the other case involves two barges, the L1 and M65 which where the Cargill, a barge fleet at Jackson's Landing which is in Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.390" offset="860975">Now two of those barges left the landing and were later found to be sunk and the owners marked those barges for a while and then tendered an abandonment to the Core of engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.254" offset="944358">The abandonment was rejected and the United States Government, the Department of Justice filed an action for a declaratory judgment asking the Court to require the owners of those barges to mark them and also to declare that they must be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.323" offset="1016665">Now, those barges remained un-removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.113" offset="1031816">The barge in the Wycom case, it's back was broken when it went down and but the tanks and the chlorine were as I've said delivered back.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.943" offset="1071104">They were subsequently sold pursuant to the request of the government and the $80,000 that was derived from their sale has been covered into the registry of the Court to await the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.505" offset="1137351">Now, the District Court rendered the motions for summary judgment and dismissed both actions and stated that the only right that the government had to recover removal expenses was against the cargo was against the vessels themselves and the cargo and there was no in personam right.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.019" offset="1239437">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that a vessel negligently sunk in a navigable channel and I might say, if the Court please, that the negligent issue comes into this case as the Court can appreciate because it was decided on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.130" offset="1315924">We don't admit for one minute that negligence exists and in fact the Court below has, in its judgment, has centered back to the District Court for determination of both the question of causation and the question of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.984" offset="1387290">But the Court said that a sunken vessel did constitute an obstruction within the provisions of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and that the removal of the vessels could be compelled by the injunctive process that is granted by Section 12 of that statute and then they shifted over -- then that Court below shifted over and said that because the injunctive process exists you have the alternative right to recover the expenses of removal.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.819" offset="1822699">Now, there are two questions, two major questions if the Court please, which is involved here, one is the overall question.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.611" offset="1853837">Whether a vessel owner or other party who by negligence causes a vessel to sink and become an obstruction to navigation is liable in personam to the United States for the expenses of removing the obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.287" offset="1912560">Now, the second and it's to some extent subsidiary, but it's still a major question, is whether a sunken vessel constitutes an obstruction to navigation under Section 10, the removal of which can be enforced by injunction pursuant to the provisions of Section 12 of the same statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.777" offset="2014438">In other words, you think that these two cases has to be governed by the same principle?</text>

            <text syncTime="487.004" offset="2051427">Despite the fact that in one case the abandonment was accepted by the Core of engineers in a letter saying that we'll proceed to move the chlorine barge under provisions of Section 19 and then the other case the United States appears to accept the abandonment?</text>

            <text syncTime="520.301" offset="2184547">In other words, as I'll develop further on, in the argument when we consider the Sections 15, 19 and 20 in certain situations abandonment is assumed, in other words, the failure to take any action creates abandonment, as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="656.505" offset="2729357">That's our position and apparently it was the position of both courts below because the District Court as I have stated consolidated them and granted the motions to dismiss which were filed by the respondents in both cases and so they, the cases have come up together and are before this Court together.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.972" offset="2819218">Now we think this is a most unique situation, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.206" offset="2840221">This statute -- the statute of 1899, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 has been in existence for 68 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.436" offset="2885151">Back in 1923 the United States Government and principally the Department of Justice, but the moving body in the attempt to recover the expenses of removal was of course the Core of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.584" offset="2945755">Back in 1923 they began to attempt to recover in personam against vessel owners for removal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.745" offset="2982327">Way back in the Laud case versus United States in the Sixth Circuit after 43 years they have attempted unsuccessfully until this decision below to have a court declare that a sunken vessel was an obstruction of -- to navigation within Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.022" offset="3083473">This is the only decision on the books and I say this, I appreciate this as this Court does that there isn't any -- that numbers alone do not establish the soundness of a doctrine but if a decision stands alone when you have 11 cases and they are in the Second Circuit, the Third Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit and I'll mention three cases right now that this Court is very familiar with, involving this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.928" offset="3223071">One is the Texmar decision that, where certiorari was applied for from the Ninth Circuit and where certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.940" offset="3263091">There is the Marine Towing Company case that's as recent, half -- six months ago in which the Fourth Circuit declined to follow the decision below and in which certiorari application, for which certiorari is now pending in this Court and then there the Zubik case in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.418" offset="3345011">Now all three of those decisions and then the decisions, other decisions, in other words the 11 decisions in there entirely have declined to follow a decision of this Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.253" offset="3408436">Now the other side of that coin is that this Court has said on several occasions, that where you have a uniform construction of a statute over a long period of time that construction should not be upset rightly and I simply want to read because it's very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.831" offset="3502686">What this Court said in the United States versus Ryan case in that connection, it said “we should have the state to set aside at this late date the uniform construction given to the section with respect to this question by the lower courts for more than 60 years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="870.347" offset="3584711">Now we don't have quite 60 years in this case, but we have 43 years and we say that, we say that if one circuit Court of Appeals comes along and has the only decision that goes down this particular path that it simply can't be right in all the rest of these Federal Courts and three -- and the Federal Courts and in Circuit Courts of Appeals and four other circuits are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.294" offset="3704560">Now, if the Court please there is nothing in the history of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 nor in the provisions of Section 10 on that Act which makes it applicable to negligently sunken vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.443" offset="3773106">You can look whether -- you can look with absolute, you can scan every word in Section 10 and you will not find a single reference to a vessel sunken or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.643" offset="3841964">Now I ask this Court to bear with me for just a minute to view the historic background that will demonstrate I think, that Congress has since its inception been concerned about sunken vessels as separate entity as entities that are separate from piers and break waters and from the depositing of industrial wastes which Mr. Justice Douglas brought about in the Republic Steel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.177" offset="3976129">Now as long ago as 1824 Congress enacted the first legislation having to do with the improvement of navigation and it had to do in general terms with improving the navigation of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.335" offset="4040704">Then between 1824 and 1880 where you had sunken vessels, they had to go to Congress and get individual private Acts, they were separate Acts that had to do with the removal of those individual wrecks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.813" offset="4118653">Then you come up to 1890, no in 1880 they had their first, they had their first legislation where they had a continuing appropriation to take care of the removal of wrecks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.622" offset="4185840">And then they got in 1890, they added a provision which set forth the wrecks not raised within two months become derelicts and the United States could declare them an obstruction and they could be removed without any liability to the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.199" offset="4260133">Now all of this, if the Court please, was background for what this Court has described as legislation envisioning a grand design covering the navigation -- the navigability of rivers and the removal of obstructions and that's the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.638" offset="4353964">Now there are three sections in that Rivers and Harbors Act, 15, 19 and 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.875" offset="4394924">They all relate to vessels, all relate to vessels, all of them specify, all of them specify what shall be done in different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.545" offset="4441527">Now for example, for example Section 15 provides that the, there shall be that the vessel owner when a vessel sinks must mark the vessel, that the failure to do so is to be considered an abandonment and subject the vessel to removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.423" offset="4545076">Section 19 provides that if nothing has been done by the vessel owner in 30 days or if he abandons prior to 30 days then the Core of Engineers can remove and what they do from a practical standpoint as this Court knows is they, is they enter into a contract for the removal and then they sell the wreck and the money that they get is deposited into the Treasury of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.885" offset="4690944">Now Section 20 involves emergency situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.028" offset="5167522">And so they concluded to proceed under Section 19 which provides that if after 30 days nothing has been done, it's declared abandoned and then the go ahead and remove it and that's what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.302" offset="5252577">Now we say under both those sections that there is no in personam right first of all to get an injunction against the owners of the barges or the recovery expenses and in the Wycom case to recover expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.621" offset="5345886">Now we say this if the Court please, if I think, I hope I demonstrated that for more than a 100 years Congress had considered sunken vessels as separate entities and I think it's significant that these three sections that I am talking, that I have talked about are called wreck statutes, in other words they apply to sunken vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.160" offset="5480051">Now if the court below were correct in saying that a sunken vessel is an obstruction within Section 10, first of all I don't have to suggest to this Court how easy it would have been for Congress to have included vessels when they were talking about in Section 10, such things as break waters and the depositing of waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.270" offset="5596453">Now the court did not do that because it had these other three sections, this part applies, specifically the sunken vessel.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="1904.898" offset="7722924">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.280" offset="7736508">As this Court observed in the Republic Steel case, Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 was part of a great design to facilitate unimpeded flow of water commerce over our nation's waterways by ensuring the existence of navigable channels free from obstructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.222" offset="7836296">Now the question in this case reduced to a simple form, is whether or not those and this case doesn't involve just ship owners it also involves others, negligently create obstructions in the navigable waters of the United States in violation of two, not one, but two express prohibitions in the Rivers and Harbors Act as well as in derogation of common law responsibilities relating to the maintenance of public nuisances and who having violated the Act then have failed to comply with an explicit statutory command to remove the obstruction can be compelled by judicial process either to remove it or as in the case of the Wycom 112 where the government was required to affect removal and be required to reimburse the United States the expense incurred by the public treasury in affecting the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.164" offset="8091982">If the Court pleases we believe starting point is that the court below held Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, Section 10 in turn prohibits the creation of any not just some but any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by Congress to the navigable capacity to any of waters in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.186" offset="8196159">Now as this Court observed in Republic Steel case, the cause of holding that industrial waste constituted the obstruction within the meaning of Section 10 term obstruction has been given by the Court, a very broad reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.224" offset="8264286">It encompasses that this Court said many, many years ago in the Rio Grande Irrigation Company, anything whatever done or however done within the limits of the jurisdiction of the United States which tends to destroy the navigable capacity of one of the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.436" offset="8337115">Now I don't see how it can be argued that a sunken vessel any less than a dam or industrial wastes constitutes and obstruction within the meaning of that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.277" offset="8400436">Furthermore, Section 10 as this Court observed in Public Steel case was intended to codify the existing law and making 1894, five years before the enactment of the 1899 Act the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit have held that a sunken vessel was an obstruction within the meaning of Section 10 of 1890 Act, which Act contained similar language in Section 10, Section 10 of 1899 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.130" offset="8535855">Now being within Section 10, we submit that the petitioners here are under the doctrine of Republic Steel case responsible for the removal of the vessel or for the removal to assume the costs of the removal by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.224" offset="8620283">Now the violation of Section 10's prohibition has made it crime by Section 12 of the Act and this is settled rule that the disregard the command of a penal statute is a wrongful Act for which the courts will imply a right to recover damages from the attending party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.399" offset="8696978">This a rule which is illustrated by such decisions of this Court as Texas &amp; Pacific Rail Road versus Rigsby and J.I. Case Company versus Borak relatively recent decision, 377 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.176" offset="8748074">Now we think it was this general principal that was at the bottom of the determination in Republic Steel that despite the absence of an express provision for injunctive relief that Section 10 carried with it the implicit remedy of injunction where as here an obstruction to navigable waters have been created.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2188.289" stopTime="2224.198">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="2188.289" offset="8856534">But there is an express provision for injunction, isn't there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.919" offset="8879000">In Section 12 there is an expressed provision for a injunction, which relates back to Section 10 but the problem there is it, it talks in terms of removal of any structures or parts of structures and the language doesn't seem to me as broad as language of Section 10 which says that creation of any obstruction is prohibited.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="2224.198" stopTime="2400.388">
            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="2224.198" offset="9000208">Yes Mr. Justice Fortas, actually in the Republic Steel case the Court of Appeals had held that the United States was not entitled to an injunction under Section 10 where the obstruction did not constitute a structure and the Court had relied upon the fact that Section 12 had conferred a specific right with respect to structures and therefore proceeded on the assumption that Congress did not intend injunctive relief to available where the obstruction did not constitute a structure and this Court reversed that determination holding that the Section 10 taken in the context of its great design permitted the implication of those remedies, which are appropriate to the carrying out of that design.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.422" offset="9209083">Now we think the injunctive remedy is plainly within the scope of permissible remedies, indeed Republic Steel still holds and we think as two Courts of Appeals have recognized that another appropriate remedy where necessary as this, the case with Wycom 112 is the remedy of -- of recovering removal costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.537" offset="9297481">There is certainly no reason as the Second Circuit pointed out from paving why the offender should escape his due merely because the situation is such the government feels compelled to go into court rather to remove the vessel at the outset rather than to pursue its often slow injunctive remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.793" offset="9382536">Now even if Court pleases Section 10 did not embrace the obstruction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.414" offset="9417017">It is conceded as we understand it that this obstruction created by negligence was a violation of Section 15, which makes it unlawful to voluntarily or carelessly sink or permit or caused to be sunk vessels or other crafts in navigable channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.610" offset="9505834">Now despite the fact Section 15 goes on to impose an affirmative express duty upon he who causes an obstruction, indeed causes an obstruction even innocently to remove the obstruction, seek to immediately remove the obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.362" offset="9592769">The position of these petitioners is that they do not need to comply with that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.345" offset="9616802">All that they need to do is to tell the Core of Engineers that even though this obstruction was occasioned negligently, even though they have the statutory duty, they are abandoning the vessel and at that point the consequences of their negligence falls upon the United States and upon the public treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.600" offset="9701752">Now we submit that there --</text>

          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2400.388" stopTime="2472.165">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="2400.388" offset="9704887">And that sort of what the statute says at least the first part of it of what you just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.445" offset="9733204">Let us say that if a owner does not remove the wreck then failure to do so should be considered as an abandonment of such craft and subject the same to removal by the United States and what you have to argue, I'm taking what you are arguing is that the explicit remedies, a fact that negligence sinking or willful sinking of the ship is a crime and punishable as statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.879" offset="9882937">Fact that sinking and abandonment of the ship enables the United States to take it and to sell it and sell the cargo that despite the specific reference to those remedies, there are two other remedies namely, they are not specified, namely injunction and in personam liability?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="2472.165" stopTime="2703.327">
            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="2472.165" offset="9992025">Yes Mr. Justice Fortas, I would say in that connection this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.144" offset="10003937">The reason for the provisions in Section 15 and again in Section 19 with respect to the abandonment of vessels was not the immunization of negligent ship owners and others from liability in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.368" offset="10088887">The reason that these provisions were inserted and I might say that they apply not only in the case of negligibly sunk vessels, but also in the case of innocently sunk vessels where the vessel sinks without any fault upon the owner was to provide immunity to the United States if it sought to remove the vessel and the United States has had to from time to time invoke those provisions for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.314" offset="10196616">An example of that is the first Zubik case, Zubik against the United States where Zubik was challenging the right of the United States to remove and to retain a sunken vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.040" offset="10255548">And as the Court observed in that case the statute conferred upon the United States the right where the vessel has been abandoned by the owner, this is irrespective again whether the owner is at fault or not, to step in, if it feels necessary to do so to remove the vessel and it is given then the right to disposal of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.897" offset="10358993">Now there is no suggestion at all that in those provisions, Congress was intending to change the settled rule of the limitation of liability Act, an Act which I might say until their reply brief filed at least received by us just today, the petitioners entirely ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.891" offset="10442898">Now the Limitation of Liability Act enacted in 1851 as construed consistently by this Court restricts the right of the owner, ship owner to limit his liability to the value of the vessel and its cargo then pending that's after all what the petitioners are seeking to do here to cases in which the loss or the damage was without the owner's perfidy or fault or knowledge rather and that has been construed by this Court to mean without the owners fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.167" offset="10607992">Now it's utterly inconceivable to us if the Court pleases that in 1899 when Congress was enacting, what again this Court has recognized to be this great design for the protection of our navigable waters, the Congress on the one hand imposed these affirmative responsibilities upon the ship owner and on the other hand said to the ship owner if you violate them then your rights are greater -- are greater than the rights which you had under the limitation of Liability Act of 1851.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.851" offset="10782804">It would be we respectfully submit to attribute to Congress a completely perverse intent, to subscribe to the view of the petitioners in this case that Congress intended that those who negligibly obstruct our waters to be able to trust upon the public treasury, the responsibility for removing those obstructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.944" offset="10891160">Now if the Court pleases I think that some just passing reference should be made --</text>

            <text syncTime="2712.181" offset="10952077">Your Honor, this Rivers and Harbors Act as well as most them contain very little legislative history at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.057" offset="10995649">There is essentially what I think are colloquially referred to pork barrel bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.883" offset="11014875">The legislative history of the 1899 Act does indicate however that it was not intended to change existing law, but it was a codification of existing law and that too I think was recognized by this Court in Republic Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.323" offset="11080704">Now we have set forth in our brief the 1880, the relevant provisions of 1880, 1882 and 1890 Acts and we think that those acts taken in combination certainly bare out our contention that when Congress was addressing itself to these specific remedies these were remedies which were designed for the protection of the United States against a suit by the ship owner who might have claim that his vessel has innocently sunk and if the United States had had no right to remove it and then to cart it off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.978" offset="11259277">Our statutory remedy that's correct, but this, we respectfully submit Mr. Justice Harlan that on that the remedy is to be applied here not only on the basis, again of Republic Steel but on the basis of the principle illustrated again by the Rigsby case to which I referred before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.921" offset="11335032">Now I think that it should bear a mention that we do not accept the petitioner's position that it has been held 11 times over a period of 40 years that these rights do not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.778" offset="11390516">Actually in the context of a negligent ship owner the question has come up really, squarely presented in three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.998" offset="11427401">Those were Texmar decided by the Ninth Circuit which decision was against United States by a divided vote and the recent decision of the Fourth Circuit which also was against United States there too by divided vote, Judge Browning dissented in the Ninth Circuit, Judge Sobeloff dissented in the Fourth Circuit and the unanimous decision in the government's favor in the case which is before this Court at this time for review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.771" offset="11586435">Now the only other court case, American case which dealt with a negligent ship owner as such was the second Zubik case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.500" offset="11621334">In the second Zubik case, the Court regarded Section 10 as applying to sunken vessels but it took the position that only in rem remedies were provided by the Act and that's a position we think is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.891" offset="11682983">But it in terms of the question of the ship owner's right to abandon it is just these three cases about a negligent ship owner.</text>
