            <text syncTime="155.014" offset="723466">He was a nightshift inspector, a car inspector for the B.&amp; O. Railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.620" offset="761814">I make this point as to his non-trust, non-confidential, non-secret position because he has been described in other opinions as an espionage agent, as secret agent planted in the shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.130" offset="815940">I do want to make it clear that in the sense of espionage, he had no access to anything worth extracting from company files.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.888" offset="850944">He was an investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.280" offset="856482">He had general knowledge of railroad and useful to Ruffalo and the ability to talk to railroad men in railroader's language which his useful to any lawyer who has a railroad case.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.342" offset="1056789">The original charges had been developed against Ruffalo by detectives of the American Association of Railroads presented to the Local Bar Association, which invoked the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.640" offset="1097958">Before the panel of three conducting the primary hearing, there were two charges that had to do with Ruffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.047" offset="1147591">One, that Ruffalo through -- through two charges that had to do with Orlando, one, that Ruffalo, through Orlando, had solicited the claim of a Sam Cotellesse against the P&amp;LE Railroad, that was charge four.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.219" offset="1184266">Charge five, that Ruffalo had attempted to solicit through Orlando the claim of one Quinn against the B.&amp; O.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.722" offset="1218226">Both charges were dismissed by the panel at the first level for one of any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.523" offset="1257514">During the hearing on those charges which were unsupported and later to be dismissed, Ruffalo, the respondent, was himself called for cross-examination under Ohio practice and testified before the panel, defending himself on the charge of solicitation through Orlando.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.543" offset="1329507">He said that Orlando was only an investigator who gave Ruffalo expert advice on general railroading practices, who located witnesses, sometimes interviewed them, sometimes -- and often drove witnesses to courts so they would be available to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.905" offset="1390947">Orlando investigated all of Ruffalo's railroad cases, some of them were against the B &amp; O.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.452" offset="1425220">No evidence was ever developed to any greater extent as to just what Orlando did.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.482" offset="1453328">For example, there is no evidence that he ever investigated a case in the yard in which he worked, certainly, no evidence that he ever investigated at night when he should have been on duty on his own railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.192" offset="1508185">Ruffalo said he paid him piece work, $25.00 a day and expenses and the mathematic shows that he averages 10 days a month or thereabout which is consistent with Orlando's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.571" offset="1565654">Orlando was called, he testified to the same extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.932" offset="1835133">That is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.297" offset="1844537">That was after this testimony came in that the panel added the charge, in these words that Ruffalo did conspire with Orlando and paid Orlando moneys for preparing lawsuits against the B.&amp; O., the employer of Orlando, well knowing that the practice was deceptive and was morally and legally wrong as respects Orlando toward his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.695" offset="1950177">I note here they didn't say it was wrong for Ruffalo to prepare his case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.812" offset="1966582">They said it was wrong for Orlando toward Orlando's employer and therefore wrong for Ruffalo to use Orlando when Orlando was doing something that is disloyal to his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.504" offset="2021439">At the time the charge was added, the examiner said that the only evidence he was depending upon is that from Ruffalo's own lips to you, gentlemen, and then that from Orlando saying, “We don't have anything else to support it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.452" offset="2077132">However, they did give Ruffalo time to answer the charge based on what he had already said in which was a fairly meaningless procedure since there was nothing to add or take away from it.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.111" offset="2247868">The Court of Appeals, said that if we -- the profession of high-minded man must rely upon planting secret agents in the shops of those we call to account, we cannot hope to enjoy public respect and they would not find it unreasonable for Ohio to say that this would justify disbarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.537" offset="2337520">This is the one ground on which the Court of Appeals said that Ruffalo should be disbarred from the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.119" offset="2371897">So far as our position in this Court is concerned, I realized that you said in Theard that the state court finding brought title deeds of high respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.899" offset="2498957">But our position generally is that even a lawyer is entitled to due process when he is brought up on charges, and chiefly, that he ought to have the right to know in advance that what he is doing will be called to account before some reviewing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.485" offset="2569279">I would think also that this Court would look to the right of the client, the right of the public to have his case well-prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.001" offset="2611388">Here, I realized that the Court of Appeals said, “Present rules of discovery will do all you need to do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="635.190" offset="2644093">I'm afraid the Court of Appeals' judges who wrote that have never been down on the battleground trying cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.101" offset="2675754">You can't have discovery on the federal practice until you file the petition, you can't file the petition unless you have some idea what the accident was about, and indeed, discovery presupposes that we both investigate.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.507" offset="2749419">To give discovery to the defendant, I must do some preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.823" offset="2766660">As a practical matter too, it helps when you prepare an interrogatory to know what the information is you're trying to seek, and I would think that a blind reliance on no preparation at all, with the simply list of interrogatories after you filed a lawsuit on which you don't know whether you ought to believe or not, does not really serve the client well.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.194" offset="2856103">Our Canon of Ethics would deny to railroad employees, in the Sixth Circuit at least, effective legal assistance can hardly be justified unless it really involves some basic immorality.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.049" offset="2923604">But let's take a simple example, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.918" offset="2931022">Suppose a widow calls me, I do some railroad work, not a great deal, but some, says her husband has been killed on the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.863" offset="2966862">She has no real knowledge what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.061" offset="2975640">She's heard some rumors, in those cases and they have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.405" offset="2996955">It's commonplace to call a former client who you know works on the railroad and ask him if he will come in and tell you what he knows, what has he heard, and what area of the yard did it happen, what track, what generally is the story around the yard as to how the accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.390" offset="3072920">And these men generally are willing to come in but always with a caveat.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.286" offset="3092564">I'll have to mark off if I do, “Will you pay me for my time?”</text>
            <text syncTime="752.098" offset="3111790">Well, of course, you'll pay him for his time.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.760" offset="3122448">In the same way in an admiralty case who will pay a seaman first time to come in and tell us what is the layout of the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.252" offset="3148361">What kind of tackle?</text>
            <text syncTime="762.233" offset="3152332">What kind of equipment was involved in the accident?</text>
            <text syncTime="765.701" offset="3166124">And lawyers do pay money to employees of corporate defendant for information necessary to get some knowledge of the case and to lead them into further exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.262" offset="3216384">But the simple act of like paying an employee of say the River Terminal Railroad, to come in and tell what he has heard, would now be condemned by the holding of the Supreme Court of Ohio because there is no question but that it is a payment of money to a general employee for information helpful in preparing a case against that railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.419" offset="5493008">To me, this is a critical point.I think lawyers do need advanced definition from some source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.737" offset="5522369">It may be that the wrong is so universally recognized that you need not spell it out, but for a course of conduct that has been followed by lawyers from time in memorial, I think you do need advance definition when you're going to say, from now on this is improper and we will disbar a man who did it before we ever said it was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.622" offset="5617873">To say that you cannot pay for information is to say that every district attorney in the United States should be disbarred, I would assume, if he uses the information that comes from a paid informer who actually breaches someone's trust which isn't much go as much deeper than this business of using a simple yard laborer as an investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.673" offset="5710033">And note, Ohio had said that misconduct, as a defined offense, consists of a violation of the Canon of Professional Ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.019" offset="5755486">There are 47 of those who any lawyer could read through the 47 and know generally what he could do and what he could not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.014" offset="5791431">But if they say this is misconduct, and then they do, misconduct is defined as the term as used herein, says Ohio, as a violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.179" offset="5844093">No one has been able to find anywhere in all of the 47 Canons where this kind of views of an investigator violates anything or even comes close to violating a Canon of Ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.769" offset="5898428">Now this was the argument I made in the Court of Appeals, saying it is not wrong to which the Court of Appeals said that due process doesn't require the Bar Association to fashion a Canon of Ethics in advance on this ground that our lawyers are just not ethically naïve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.994" offset="5987349">I quote the Court exactly in language that I've said in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.417" offset="6001037">I thought it was rather prim, if a lawyer can read all of Draco's legal ethics, which is the leading text, read all the Canons and read every decision in the United States and find no word anywhere that hiring a man like Orlando is wrong, then on what -- how does due process get satisfied?</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.068" offset="6115662">How do you reconcile this with Lanzetta, with Connolly, with Giaccio, with Bouie where you've said in every kind of proceeding, where there is to be some criminal or quasi-criminal penalty, an advanced definition is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.909" offset="6183058">And particularly, when you give an advanced definition, this is your decision in Bouie of course, if you give an advanced definition as Ohio has saying, it's a violation of a Canon of Ethics, how can you then say you have satisfied due process when retroactively you expend and say any kind of conduct that we deem to show who are moral character will be enough to justify disbarment even though it doesn't violate the Canon of Ethics?</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.140" offset="6451911">The Court of Appeals said that one who hires an experienced lawyer, and here was a lawyer John Ruffalo who had 18 years of experience at the bar practicing in Youngstown, Ohio, to act as an undercover agent to obtain evidence and information for use in suits against his own employer does not exhibit the fair character and the integrity which must be the mark of a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.836" offset="6606764">The Court said, “We do not believe we should say to today's society of whom we ask that our profession be held in high regard that we do not have the ability to represent our clients except through planting secret agents in the shops of those we call to account in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.166" offset="6728077">If this kind of espionage is -- has become a way of life in some of today's business, more is expected of a lawyer, then that they conform to the minimal standards of the marketplace.</text>
