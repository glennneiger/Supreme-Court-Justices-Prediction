            <text syncTime="113.202" offset="556178">Now the important consideration for the purposes of this case is this, yesterday the counsel referred to the alleged filing of a spurious will and two other alleged contemptuous acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.597" offset="761710">Now we understand that the briefs filed by all parties are a part of the certiorari filed in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.656" offset="834017">Now what we are getting at is this, the case is here before this Court on the issue as to whether or not he was entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.496" offset="877380">But the very issue, the very point which a jury could give him to wit the finding of guilt or non-guilt, the finding of guilt or innocence is not challenged and has never been challenged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.094" offset="7671724">Article II, Section 9 says, “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to a speedy public trial by an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.318" offset="7716655">Nevertheless in Illinois over the years, there has grown up a body of law which I frankly concedes to the Court which has consistently withheld from criminal contender's a right to trial by a jury which I analyzed incidentally in my brief before the Supreme Court of the State to show that it grew as somewhat in topsy like fashion and was based upon a forced premise which originated in a pure civil contempt case where of course it's quite proper to deny trials by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.364" offset="7848835">And based upon that fragile basis, they grew with Illinois the body of law to which I have just referred and to which the Illinois Supreme Court still adheres in this case dismissing the holding of this Court in Cheff v.

            <text syncTime="1985.304" offset="8044544">You're quite right Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.845" offset="8050709">Up until now, they have adhere to Green and Barnett and in fact rely upon it again in their decision in this case, the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.263" offset="8100446">And we're critical of that of course when we say that they have failed to recognize the important modifications in Green and Barnett as now written by this Court in Cheff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.462" offset="8149243">Incidentally, I revisited Green after the colloquy I had with the Court yesterday and I am able to say that the Court that there was no criminal statute involved in Green in effect at the time of the alleged contemptuous acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.380" offset="8224893">The defendant there had been convicted of a crime and jumped and he refused to obey an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.189" offset="8260106">As he jumped down, he refused to obey an order to surrender and he was tried on contempt for disobedience of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.444" offset="8293125">And as Mr. Justice Harlan wrote in the majority opinion of that case, he observed that the bail jumping statute had not yet been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.665" offset="8330010">It had been enacted in 1990 -- in 1954 whereas the contemptuous acts -- the acts complained off occurred in 1951 and passed it on to the Court because I received the impression probably incorrectly yesterday that there was a contention that there was a criminal statute at to time.One other thing, counsel refers to the fact that in the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois we conceded guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.040" offset="8459577">And Mr. Justice White's observation on it of course I thought was quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.002" offset="8479431">That is that we contested right from the very beginning of course by reason of our plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.127" offset="8503881">But when we got to the Supreme Court of the State upon the record, I did not plan to engage in a long argument based upon the sufficiency of the evidence since the trial judge waived the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.824" offset="8558634">He was the trier of the fact, he waived the evidence, he judged the credibility of the witnesses and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.937" offset="8583084">Oh, I did not, however concede in the Supreme Court of the State that there was just no other side to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.539" offset="8609520">I said incidentally in brief that the page referred to by Mr. Hladis, in a footnote that the defendant concedes that the people's evidence when viewed on appeal as it must be viewed on appeal in the light most favorable to the people that the evidence was sufficient to support the Court's judgment because it's quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.324" offset="8700635">And I also said in our brief here on page 2, I said the petitioner did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence of the Illinois Supreme Court in view of the rule prevailing in that state that a verdict will not be disturbed on appeal when there is any evidence which when taken with its intendments most favorable to an appellee tends to prove the essential allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.558" offset="8817560">I would, I submit most respectfully to the Court that a complete waste of time to me on this record to go up and say that our psychiatrist should have been believed, the psychiatric evidence established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.126" offset="8863848">As Mr. Justice Brennan says that the malevolent intent necessary to a criminal contempt was not shown but we had an attorney who represented an adversary party in the trial court proceedings testified in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.081" offset="8931662">A cross-examination that when he thought with the petitioner prior to the time that he would open or present the spurious will, he was convinced and this is in the record that the petitioner did not realize the involvements he was getting into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.244" offset="9000312">It did not have the mind, my own language to understand his predicament at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.277" offset="9024449">All of which within, but this was disregarded of course by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.067" offset="9047646">And I point out although it -- only been touched on briefly by Mr. Hladis that one of the complications in this case is this amicus curiae secret report which we have referred to as the fink report since the amicus curiae was a Mr. Fink.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.098" offset="9131760">I like to think that the word is descriptive incidentally by the card here but in any event, the -- that report found its way into the trial court's chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.448" offset="9173138">It was viewed there in camera and he has refused to make it part of the record here in this case although we asked for an order on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.940" offset="9211173">So it still remains secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.502" offset="9217337">We don't know what's in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.238" offset="9224338">And it compounds the fact that we would deny the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.076" offset="9247640">Had we had a jury would be bad enough for the trial court to have such a report anyway if you can visualize a Federal District Court judge with FBI reports at his chambers before he proceeds to a trial -- a case if it's so much similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.709" offset="9306258">But where the trier of the fact is that person and I think additional emphasis should be given to (Inaudible) and that is one of the errors we complained about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.707" offset="9458186">In it, they alleged that they sought fraud was being perpetrated upon the Court by the presentation of this other will and they specifically asked the trial court for the appointment of an amicus curiae for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting if necessary the fraud involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.445" offset="9541151">The trial court read at that motion and appointed Mr. Fink.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.109" offset="9559855">Thereafter, I think within approximately 60 or 90 days, the trial court entered an order upon the amicus curiae requiring him to file his report with the trial court and such a report was filed and was held in camera by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.462" offset="9637177">Now the record incidentally on that shows when we made a demand for it prior to trial and then again at trial, now the Court, page 81 of the record said, “It is not a part of the record, it belongs to the Court itself and the Court will turn it over to you and you will be at liberty to read it as concerns any witnesses testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.345" offset="9736756">The Court wants to get at the truth or falsity at the proceeding so I will turn it over to you and you may use it for cross-examination”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.737" offset="9770297">And it was, portions of it were turned over to me somewhat in Jenks style, that is where a witness took the stand who was referred to in the fink report then I was entitled to cross-examine there on the basis of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.602" offset="9825782">But that was not the entire report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.819" offset="9834663">There is no way that we can show it to the Court where -- there is no way that we can indicate to the Court whether or not we are prejudiced which was the grounds relied upon by the Illinois Supreme Court for denying us a relief in that -- in connection with this particular point but I submit to the Court that it was impossible under the circumstances here for us to get such a report to determine whether or not we had been prejudiced since the trial judge himself to which (Inaudible) significance, refused to give it to us and refused to put it in the record.</text>
