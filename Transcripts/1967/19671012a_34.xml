            <text syncTime="185.948" offset="847182">I think that even under Your Honor's opinion, and I think that reading Your Honor's opinion and taking the majority decision, the distinction which is made here by the court below could not stand up even under Your Honor's dissent in the Sinclair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.470" offset="913220">That's why I used the word, “under the guise of” because in the other case we met the issues squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.945" offset="939133">The issue -- this Court met the issue squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.151" offset="948015">Can you enter an order restraining a labor dispute?</text>
            <text syncTime="214.285" offset="960554">Can this -- can any federal court enter an order restraining a work stoppage or publicity or any of the other things which are protected by the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.061" offset="999633">This was meeting the issue squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.942" offset="1007156">In this case, the issue was raised while -- “does it make any difference?”</text>
            <text syncTime="231.280" offset="1028472">The court below said, “Well, we're not really restraining a work stoppage, we're not really doing any of the other things which involved the protective activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.698" offset="1066193">What we're doing here is simply to enforce an arbitrator's award."</text>
            <text syncTime="243.963" offset="1079254">And we say and I think that we can demonstrate Your Honor that this is a distinction without a difference and therefore, this is why we used the word “under the guise of” and I think that even under, as I said before, under Your Honor's dissenting opinion, that distinction could not be tenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.830" offset="1154696">That is the first, that is the basic issue in this case and if Your Honors should resolve that issue as Your Honors did in the Sinclair in favor of the union here, then everything else would fall away because there would be no jurisdiction in the court below to entertain any of the other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.228" offset="1224286">Again, in the -- another question, the second question may be broken down but I'll try to put it all in one question, involved in the so-called injunction aspect of the cases, was it error for the trial judge to retain jurisdiction, assuming that he had it in the first place of a case admittedly moot just in case something might happen at some future time, and thereafter, when another dispute unrelated to the first one arose, they held the hearing on an ex parte report of one of the parties, an ex parte report of one of the parties without any formal pleading, without setting forth on record any new complaint or any amended complaint under dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.120" offset="1395858">And without requiring any newer amended complaint, pleading the new dispute and then enter an innocuous order which he refused to explain or clarify in anyway in violation of Rules 52 and 65(d) -- Rules 52(a) and 65(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="338.898" offset="1458970">These are the two basic questions which are related to the first injunction aspect of the case, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.618" offset="1493870">Now, with respect to the basic facts, ILA, the International Longshoremen's Association is in contractual relationship with PMTA, the Philadelphia Marine Trade Association under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the Philadelphia waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.057" offset="1563564">There are just a few aspects of that agreement that I would like to call to Your Honor's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.290" offset="1580492">Just I think four possibly five points -- five provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.240" offset="1600345">I might say at the outset that one of the major provisions in this contract was what they call “the day before hiring”.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.948" offset="1631169">Previously, they would hire the same day in the morning and the man would not know whether they had any work until they appeared at the shape up of 18 different points along the waterfront and when they were hired that day, then they knew they had hired them, they would have certain guarantees so that they couldn't be knocked off for any reason except those specifically outlined in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.088" offset="1711731">Under this agreement now, they had to be told the day before.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.960" offset="1727195">They have to be hired that day before for work commencing the next day and it might be during the period of the -- during the top period that the ship is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.027" offset="1759483">In any event, this is what they call the day before hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.213" offset="1776201">This hiring is not done at the hiring center.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.328" offset="1788635">This might be an important factor Your Honors will determine later.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.503" offset="1801383">It is not done at the hiring center.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.919" offset="1807026">These men are advised by their particular foreman the day before and they appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.757" offset="1830431">Now, one of the key provisions involved in this argument is the provision entitled 10(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="438.921" offset="1859062">This is the Section 10(6) that Your Honors will find in the record of number 34 on page 7 which provides what they call a “set-back clause” and it simply gives the employer the right to postpone the start of work from 8 o'clock in the morning till 1 o'clock in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.868" offset="1954879">And under these circumstances, the men get a one hour guarantee for the morning's work which they missed.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.443" offset="1981106">Another provision under this contract is Section 9(h) which provides that when the men are not put to work because of inclement weather, then they must be given the four-hour guarantee for the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.884" offset="2042859">The difference here is whether or not the one hour guarantee, the employers here, tend to assert the -- and did assert the Section 10(6) and try to give them under one hour guarantee instead of the four-hour guarantee under the Inclement Weather Clause even though the men were knocked off or not put to work because of inclement weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.905" offset="2135019">And then the last provision that I would note to Your Honors' attention in the collective bargaining agreement, is number 28 which relates to the grievance and arbitration machinery and this provides that all disputes and this say, I'm quoting the language now, all disputes of whatever nature or kind must be submitted to arbitration, including the interpretation of the agreement and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.885" offset="2222895">It's a very broad clause and all disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.884" offset="2234911">And I may say that under this clause, and under this particular clause and under the practice of the industry, whenever a dispute arose and that was sent to arbitration, if another dispute arose involving even the same issue, the parties did have the right and in fact exercise it and went to the arbitrator again.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.265" offset="2316413">There may be some, might be some distinction between the first dispute and the second dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.404" offset="2340968">But in any event, both parties always exercise the right to go to the arbitrator as many times as they wanted and I may say that previously, and I cited in my brief, when the Father Comey was the arbitrator on the Philadelphia waterfront, he -- the same issue, I think it was under 14(d), which is so-called -- involving the introduction of the so-called “technological advances” into the waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.938" offset="2443160">Father Comey had ruled on these four occasions that the issue was not arbitrable and on each occassion, he interpreted this Section 14(d) to mean that this was a matter for negotiation of the parties and it was not arbitrable because it was under the provisions of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.764" offset="2522467">It involved a technological advancement and therefore, it had to be negotiated and not arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.115" offset="2539813">The fifth time, the same kind of a dispute under the same provision of the agreement came before Father Comey.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.470" offset="2565204">He again refuted and said, “Well, it's only human to err” and he reversed himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.807" offset="2590595">There was some question.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.593" offset="2593729">My friend raises the question and says that he didn't really reverse himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.389" offset="2604910">I think he did the arbitration whether there's evidence but that doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.916" offset="2619016">The point is that he received the same dispute and the same clause and he interpreted the same clause five times.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.312" offset="2648586">The first four times uniformly; the fifth time he reversed himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.059" offset="2667604">The point I want to make is that throughout, even though the same issue was involved, the parties had the right to go to arbitration and that the arbitrator say whether (a) if it is the same dispute; (b) whether he still wants to follow the same decision that has been rendered before on the basis of this particular clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.511" offset="3085458">I was going to cover this but I think this would be a good point to break it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.855" offset="3094758">In other words, we had one dispute where the employer knocked the men off or told them to change the starting time from 8 o'clock in the morning to 1 o'clock in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.479" offset="3141256">He is supposed to do that by 7:30 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.048" offset="3151600">So the contract reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.445" offset="3161109">This went to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.564" offset="3165602">The union claims that it was governed by the provisions of 9(h), which relate -- which was the Inclement Weather Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.381" offset="3188903">The men were changed from 8:00 to 1:00 because the weather was inclement.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.637" offset="3205935">The union claimed that the Inclement Weather Clause applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.588" offset="3217742">The employer's claim that Section 10(6) applied which they said was unqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.437" offset="3241148">So they went to arbitration and the arbitrator handed down as award holding that Section 10(6) standing by itself was very clear and it must not be construed against -- in the light of anything else in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.451" offset="3297155">He did not consider 9(h), the Inclement Weather Clause did not give the union a full opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.026" offset="3319515">I may say that at the conclusion of the testimony and that was a long joint out hearing too.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.630" offset="3341876">We were quite surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.801" offset="3346578">I think both my friend and myself was surprised when he said he didn't want to hear argument, he didn't want have briefs so that we could sum up from the evidence which had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.802" offset="3378552">In any event, he ruled that Section 10(6) of the agreement was an unqualified provision which said that the employers could not demand the offer, could postpone the employment time with only one hour guarantee for the morning instead of the four-hour inclement weather guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.356" offset="3444799">Now, the next time a dispute arose and I was going to cover this specifically, that was the first dispute and he handed that down in connection with the dispute which arose on April in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.713" offset="3490252">About two or three months later, another dispute arose and men knocked off in this -- and each one of these instances, they were knocked off because the men -- one of the four-hour guarantee they thought they were entitledto the four-hour guarantee under the Inclement Weather Clause and the union again wanted to go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.655" offset="3562036">I think this brings up your focuses, attention immediately on the point that Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart raised and that is, could we again go to arbitration?</text>
            <text syncTime="874.541" offset="3601533">Now, just as the employers -- one that had do it and did in fact do it in other -- in connection with 14(d) when new advances were brought in to determine whether it was a new piece of machinery and whether the clause should be construed for arbitration or negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.823" offset="3678647">The point is that the arbitrator took it and upon his -- followed that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.924" offset="3695052">Now, between the time of the first dispute, Your Honor, and the time of the last one which was about 10 months, the employers invoked this clause 71 times; 71 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.176" offset="3748028">There were four occasions, however, when there were work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.210" offset="3768195">The first time, I don't believe there was a work stoppage but the remaining three did result in work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.993" offset="3787316">Now, when Your Honor says that well, they could do it tomorrow and the next day and the next day, Your Honor, I think overlooks the fact that each of these disputes is based on a separate set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.162" offset="3836008">It may involve the same principle or it may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.326" offset="3848652">It may involve a qualification of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.062" offset="3859623">But whether or not it involves the same principle, there's something which both parties have a right to test just as this Court has even in the past reversed itself perhaps not frequently but it has, but at least, the parties do have the right even if a sort -- that this Court should hand down a decision on a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.672" offset="3946036">Well, let's take Mahnich versus Southern Transportation Company where the Court handed down -- this Court handed down the decision and handed down and set forth the principle of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.131" offset="5579943">There was no order by the arbitrator requiring the men to return to work and when he simply said the arbitrator's award will be enforced, we could argue that on some other case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2499.568" offset="10101635">And that same case, Your Honors held that the -- you recognized that arbitration was the so-called “kingpin of the federal labor policy”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.688" offset="10138102">But you said that this Court is not the one that forged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.691" offset="10150118">That was for Congress to forge and I might say there that I think that the court below went astray when they took a part of Your Honor's decision in the Sinclair cases, stopped right in the middle where this Court was saying that arbitration is an important aspect of federal labor policy and so on but then they stopped right in the middle of the part there because Your Honors went on to say, “However, wherever the conduct which is being restrained or which is involved is an opposition to that involved in Section 4 of the Norris LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.754" offset="10290343">It just can't be entertained.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.755" offset="10302360">And Your Honor said that the courts have not about to go back into the business of injunctions again, of handing out injunctions against labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.687" offset="10330154">And so that -- I think that's where the court below went wrong in construing or in referring to Your Honors' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.233" offset="10352306">I stopped right in the middle of the paragraph and they'd left out the vital part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.851" offset="10366725">If I -- if I may even -- on page 14 of my brief, after reviewing the language which the Court of Appeals below had engaged in, and they stopped -- as I said right in the middle of the paragraph, Your Honors, the paragraph contiues with this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.004" offset="10463378">At the most, what is involved is the question of whether the employer is to be allowed to enjoy the benefits of an injunction along with a right which Congress gave him in Section 301, the suit for a breach of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.932" offset="10511130">And as we have already pointed out, Congress was not willing to ensure that enjoyment to an employer at the cost of putting the federal courts back into the business and of enjoining strikes and other related peaceful union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.441" offset="10553135">This is the part that the court below didn't see apparently and overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.467" offset="10573197">And this changes the whole complexion of the opinion, of the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.298" offset="10596603">Now, Your Honors, in that case also reviewed the legislative history and demonstrated that it was intended, Congress specifically intended to retain the provision in Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and whether or not the federal -- the arbitration provision is the kingpin of federal labor policy, this is a matter for Congress to decide and not for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.952" offset="10691166">Now, the same, the amici who filed the brief here were also involved in a similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.292" offset="10716557">They argued the case as one of their clients was involved and also another one in New York -- both in New Orleans and then New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.726" offset="10742262">In the New York case, that was the Marine Transport Lines versus Curran the specific issue involved here was presented there in which the amici were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.041" offset="10795551">And there, they made the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.100" offset="10803806">They attempted to make this distinction that because there was an arbitrator's award involved, somehow that gives it a different complexion at the Court that's not really a labor dispute which is involved, in the first place, that's what they contended and the second place, since it is an arbitrator's award, they're not really were stopping a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.176" offset="10868067">That's simply enforcing an arbitrator's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.676" offset="10882069">Here's what the Court said in that case which I've set forth on page 14 of my opinion -- of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.724" offset="10906311">The Court is being asked to enjoin a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.939" offset="10923133">This is the reality of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.763" offset="10930448">Whatever may be the form of the proceeding and citing to the extent that Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, that's the case involved here, is to the contrary, I decline to follow that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.070" offset="10979662">Then the Court went on to say, ”In Sinclair, the employers sought to enjoin a work stoppage before the arbitration took place in order to make the arbitration effective”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.970" offset="11019264">Here, the employer seeks to enjoin a work stoppage after the arbitration has taken place and after the arbitrator has directed that the work stoppage ceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.488" offset="11049357">In my opinion, there was no significant difference between the two situations as far as the power of this Court is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.823" offset="11070673">It inevitably follows that Sinclair, from Sinclair, that this Court lacks jurisdiction to grant the labor request here, citing also the Gulf South America case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.348" offset="11104737">There was one other case -- there's one case which the respondent here relies or that's the New Orleans case in which the decision by judge, Chief Judge Christenberry down there, he did enforce an arbitration award back in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.568" offset="11169625">However, Judge Christenberry had the identical question before him in Gulf South America case and this was after the Sinclair decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.130" offset="11199927">At that point, after reviewing the Sinclair decision, he reversed himself so that actually, there was no basis for the -- there's no real authority or they don't even have a single case to point to in a federal system which could support their proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.381" offset="11248933">The case went up to the Court of Appeals and the same distinctions were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.144" offset="11299924">In the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the same distinctions were made there and which are made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.796" offset="11326568">On this point, the Court there found that there were two aspects to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.451" offset="11341197">First of all, they found that the arbitrator himself had exceeded his jurisdiction and said that he -- it should be dismissed on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.257" offset="11376410">But they also made this point right squarely on this -- the point that's now under consideration and I quote from the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.009" offset="11407444">“The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was without jurisdiction to grant the injunctive relief in view of Section 4 of Norris-LaGuardia Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.862" offset="11434820">The Court rejected the contention of the employer that Section 301 or the 10(5) of the Act was a pro tanto repealer of Section 4 of Norris-LaGuardia and the Court does that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.723" offset="11470242">Then they went on to make this comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.719" offset="11478288">The Court relied on Sinclair Refining Company versus Atkinson as authority for this holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.430" offset="11501066">That decision of the Supreme Court has direct authority on the question and is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.272" offset="11520502">There the employers sought the injunction directly while he had the injunction as sort under the guise of enforcing the award of an arbitrator but this is a distinction without a difference under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.558" offset="11565641">And any other result would be exhorting form of a substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.929" offset="11579120">That's what the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said in connection with the identical contention which is here made and which was adopted by the Court of Appeals below and the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.833" offset="11630738">Now, as I said, there are only two cases which the respondent relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.011" offset="11655398">One is the New Orleans case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.129" offset="11667937">I think the amici cited by Chief Judge Christenberry and as I pointed out, Chief Judge Christenberry reversed himself in the later Gulf South America case and he was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.061" offset="11711613">The other case is the Rupert case cited in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.131" offset="11723943">The Rupert case is decided on the basis of an entirely different law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.166" offset="11740035">It's the New York -- it was the state court case decided by the State Court of New York, decided on the State Law of New York, which as the state court, the Court of Appeals in New York is very careful to point out is different in the federal law and because of that difference, they held that the arbitrator's award could be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.768" offset="11806490">But because of the difference in the New York statute and they recognized that under the federal system, it would have been a contrary result that would have been achieved and they reviewed some of the federal cases on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.189" offset="11852152">There are a number like the Seafarers versus Bull Line and few of the other cases and they said that well, these were under the federal statute and --</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.720" offset="12006275">If the union is wrong and this is exactly what this Court said in Sinclair, the damage remedy is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.150" offset="12031979">The damage remedy is all that Congress intended to give to the employers under the circumstances so that the employers are not without a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.610" offset="12061863">And then from the practical standpoint, the skills are even on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.089" offset="12087777">With the injunction, and I think that perhaps Congress was motivated by this, but with the injunction, the employers put the unions in a straightjacket.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.375" offset="14288854">We had broken this down to the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.276" offset="14296482">The first one is the injunction case which involved where I have said it's the innocuous order and the second one is the contempt case which he held the union in contempt because they did engage in a work stoppage, not the union but these men engaged in work stoppage and he held the union liable for the mass action of the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.589" offset="14369729">So he said membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.006" offset="14375372">Some of them were membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.291" offset="14380492">I may say that the gentlemen from the Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, the president took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.610" offset="14397837">He said he talked to some of these men who were striking or who were walking the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.120" offset="14411839">He said he never even had seen him before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.655" offset="14418004">He's been in the waterfront 20 or 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.673" offset="14426049">Never seen him before, so that obviously, there was a strong -- there was a substantial percentage of men who were not under union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.644" offset="14445902">But assuming even they were union members, all of them, the point is that the union cannot be held liable for the mass action of the members unless it participated with the members and unless by some either overt act or by some failure to act which under circumstances where they should have acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.852" offset="14514761">As for example in the United Mine Workers case, the Court of Appeals held that Mr. Lewis first didn't send out a single letter and he didn't take any step to try to call off the work stoppage and under the circumstances, he was in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.455" offset="14565230">So the Court of Appeals said, that it would be different and the -- that was in the United Mine Workers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.375" offset="14588844">The Court of Appeals said, it would be different if Mr. Lewis had sent out a letter stating his position that he didn't want a strike or it taken some means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.902" offset="14623013">In this case, the union sent out two pamphlets in which they most strongly point out to the men that they were wrong, that they had got -- they got a good contract and they should adhere to it and that they would take them out into arbitration; that the union itself would handle it, that union officials should handle it but the men nevertheless engaged in this wild cat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.482" offset="14705351">The court below held it to be a wild cat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.172" offset="14716008">And on the basis of the UMB decision, they should be absolved for the actions of the membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="3793.253" offset="15276387">And there, the court below said that since this came at this -- they held that this was a criminal contempt or rather a civil contempt and they held that the request for a jury trial would be appropriate only in the event it was a criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.492" offset="15333334">Actually, this is a specific issue which we have raised as I said starting on page 17 of our brief and number 78, Your Honor, and which the question of civil contempt as against criminal contempt is specifically and squarely put on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.482" offset="15389341">Now, in that case, when the Act itself was originally enacted in the Norris-LaGuardia -- it was part of the Norris-LaGuardia Act originally, it covered both civil and criminal contempt arising under that Act, under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.480" offset="15457259">Subsequently, it was transferred from the Norris-LaGuardia Act and put them under Title XVIII with the criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.245" offset="15492368">However, the Act itself says that it applies to all contempt arising out of labor disputes; all contempt arising out of labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.202" offset="15528208">The court below read that language to mean criminal contempt because the Act was now -- had now been placed in Title XVIII which relates to criminal statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3873.860" offset="15598843">I thought that this would -- now actually, the question of criminal contempt and civil contempt is argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.814" offset="15618591">The court below held that it was a civil contempt and therefore, the jury trial aspect, the jury trial wasn't warranted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.435" offset="15649102">We say that the language in the Act is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.032" offset="15659551">We've spelled that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.096" offset="15663731">It says that it applies to all the contempts arising out of a labor dispute, and therefore, a party is entitled to a jury trial under those circumstances and this is where we argued the question of criminal as against civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.332" offset="15712737">And we said that when they put -- even though they put it in Title XVIII, they didn't change the phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.137" offset="15731963">It arise -- it applied to criminal as well as civil and the Act was not changed in that respect but they took out that phraseology which related only to Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.291" offset="15768534">As I said, they broadened it but did not relate it, but did not confine it only to criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.098" offset="15791731">They held the language that it applies to all cases arising out of labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.630" offset="15813883">And I may say that originally, when the Act was first enacted, the House Bill, the legislative history shows that the House Bill would have it only on a criminal contempt, Your Honor, whereas the Senate proposal had both the criminal and civil contempts involved in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.088" offset="15895698">The House changed this position to conform with the Senate so that it apply to all both criminal and civil and for that reason alone, we said that we we're entitled a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.627" offset="15929866">We may entirely request for a jury trial but here again the Court -- I see my time has been up for a while and I haven't covered my all of the point that I had intended to cover, I hope the Court will forgive me for extending my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="4003.212" offset="16116172">The arbitrator in a most comprehensive opinion considered all of the contentions which were raised by all of the parties including the contention that was raised regarding the so-called “Inclement Weather Clause”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.201" offset="16176149">And I would like to call to Your Honors' attention that on page 24 of the record, the arbitrators specifically referred to the Section 9(h) the so-called “Inclement Weather Clause” and he stated it was the union's further contention that Section 9(h) of the previous collective bargaining agreement remained intact except for the modification contained in Section 10(5) of Memorandum of Settlement so that the award covered all the contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.382" offset="16292864">It was clear and as a matter of fact, no action was taken by the union to set aside the award for any grounds whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.533" offset="16325465">So the award at the present time, the merits of the award are not subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.837" offset="16346676">This is clear under this Court's decisions and the Steel Workers trilogy cases and particularly the Enterprise case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.042" offset="16379591">Now, with respect to the facts --</text>

            <text syncTime="4071.457" offset="16389204">But that award just covered the question as to how much money certain people were going to be paid but that narrowly, isn't that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis A. Scanlan</label>
            <text syncTime="4108.703" offset="16538206">What the award did, Mr. Justice Stewart, was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.792" offset="16554506">Under the old contract, the men were hired on a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.576" offset="16573628">They reported how to shape off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.526" offset="16581465">If they were not hired for a particular day, they do not receive any pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.107" offset="16599751">Now, under the contract which the award enforce, they were hired the day before and once they were hired, if they were set-back, they were guaranteed at least five hours pay and the award, when it said that the employers have a right to set-back without qualification with respect to the pay off provisions, it meant this, that all Longshoremen who were set-back for any reason whatsoever were entitled to at least five hours pay and this was something which they do not have before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.661" offset="16737991">Now, with respect to the action that was taken by the union after this award was entered, it was quite clear that the union came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.700" offset="16786160">There was nothing nebulous about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.441" offset="16793161">There's nothing subtle about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.332" offset="16800684">The union came out and said that they were not going to abide by this award and the award itself was final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.966" offset="16835271">The parties agreed that it would be final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.122" offset="16847809">But the union on two separate occasions before this court order was entered, specifically said that they did not like the award; that they were not going to be bound by the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.909" offset="16907055">And that is the reason why this action was taken in the first instance because of the statements that were made by the officers of the union that they absolutely would not comply with this award.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.126" offset="16963897">Now, at the first hearing, it was admitted by counsel for the union that the union was bound by the award and that in spite of the fact that the arbitrator had ruled against the union that the union would have to comply with the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.795" offset="17026591">This is the reason why the hearing was continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.578" offset="17041638">Now, after that, on September the 13th, 1965 and here is an illustration of what the union actually did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.971" offset="17083225">The men were set-back.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.065" offset="17095659">The gangs were told to report at 1 o'clock but the president of the union took it upon himself to use the microphone at the central dispatching office and he notified all gangs which were set back for that particular day and who were supposed to report at 1 o'clock that afternoon, he told them, “Do not report at 1 o'clock; report at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.760" offset="17206418">And he told other gangs, which have been cancelled that day and there was no question about the cancellation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.812" offset="17230660">These gangs were told to come back the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.655" offset="17241945">There was no dispute about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.554" offset="17249573">He told those gangs to report for work at 1 o'clock that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.929" offset="17271097">So here we had a most specific violation of the arbitrator's award and it was for that reason that the order was issued at the hearing on September the 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.946" offset="17327208">Now, this testimony regarding the action by the president of the union was uncontradicted.As a matter of fact, all of the testimony, of our testimony at the first hearing and at the second hearing was uncontradicted, so that the award, the order of the Court was issued, specifically enforcing the award and notifying the union to comply with and to abide by that award.</text>

            <text syncTime="4395.412" offset="17684982">Now, with respect to Rule 65(d), even if it is construed to be a mandatory injunction, which this Court has stated in the Lincoln Mills case and the Sinclair case, it's not proscribed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.355" offset="17752795">I believe that the order still complied with Rule 65(d) because it set forth what the union was supposed to do in clear and unmistakable terms.</text>
