            <text syncTime="449.892" offset="1902947">Of course, I think that a large measure of the litigation that's taken place over the last five or seven years has gone to the legal standards in this area determining disability and the Courts, I think, showed a rather short disagreement, at least in some circuits, with the agency's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.851" offset="1986748">Now, there was a petition for certiorari pending, but this was resolved by Congress in the recent Act which, I believe, in Section 158 (b) of the Act became effective January 2 of this year overruled the Court's that had disagreed with the agency's interpretation of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.354" offset="2072743">And so, I think it's hard to gauge or really to say that the factual determinations have been largely dispositive because there has been this legal dispute and, as I say, that it had resulted in a split among the circuits that Congress has now resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.011" offset="2967385">That is correct, Justice Black, and we reach this I think on a two-pronged argument, one on the basis of the-- what the committee report says that the Congress had in mind and the other is on our reading of the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.220" offset="3028302">The legislation arouse at-- after a time when the Courts had adopted the practice of approving fees in these cases, generally according to contingent fee arrangements that the applicant had entered into with his counsel, often going as high as 30% or 40% or 50% of past-due benefits, and it was at this point that the legislation was introduced and we think for the purpose of cutting back on this Court practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.811" offset="3150660">And, the committee report which we've set forth at pages 10 and 11 of our brief has the following Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.614" offset="3181798">It has come to the attention of the committee that attorneys have, upon occasion, charged what appear to be inordinately large fees for representing claimants in Federal District Court actions arising under the Social Security program.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.612" offset="3237804">Usually, these large fees result from a contingent fee arrangement, under which the attorney is entitled to a percentage frequently one-third to one-half of the approved benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.839" offset="3282735">Since litigation necessarily involves a considerable lapse of time, in many cases large amounts of accrued benefits, and consequently large legal fees are payable if the claimant wins his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.839" offset="3334771">And then, there's a sentence that we quote that, like the two sentences that Mr. Sharp referred to yesterday, paraphrase the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.335" offset="4524701">In view of this legislative history which was least intended to cut back the fees then being approved and paid through Court actions, the Congress adopted Section 206 (b)(1) of the statute, using the word “claimant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.694" offset="4602128">And, as I suggested yesterday, the very narrow question of interpretation in this case and the only question presented in this case comes down to what does the word “claimant” mean in this statute and we suggest, in terms of statutory interpretation, there are several clauses in the statute that modify the word “claimant” and conclusively define it in a way that can mean only the plaintiff who happens to be before the Court in that case, that is the head of the family in this case, Mr. Hopkins, and that it does not include anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.038" offset="4775476">We begin this analysis of the language of the statute with the first phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.879" offset="4802853">The statute begins, “whenever a Court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under this subchapter,” we suggest to the Court that the language, “a judgment favorable to a claimant” is something that ordinarily would refer to a plaintiff before a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.450" offset="4885191">He's the person on whose behalf and whose favor a judgment is rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.546" offset="4909537">Then, the statute goes on to speak of “claimant under this subchapter who was represented before the Court by an attorney,” and we suggest that there are two points in that phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.743" offset="4966379">First, the language “before the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.099" offset="4979754">It suggests the claimant is the person who is before the Court, the person who is a party.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.771" offset="13110418">We have a saying, if the Court please, in my area and Mr. Justice Fortas's area, very sagle judge who once said to me, “tell it like it is.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.712" offset="13258271">The disability we are concerned with here is not necessarily to have resulted from any industrial accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.605" offset="13301844">It can be from sickness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.978" offset="13419290">To begin with, a man who considers himself, let's take Mr. X and Mrs. X and three minor children under the age of seniority, under the age of 17, and he has, as in this case, a very limited formal education and has done a menial task all his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.884" offset="13542902">And, let us assume that he has some demonstratable disablement and he goes to the local district office of the Social Security Administration where he is confronted by a clerk who inquires as of his name, his address, his age, his genealogy, his wife's name, and his children's names.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.319" offset="13644675">At that particular point -- and this is by statute, at that particular point, there is an application made by Mr. X, an application made by Mrs. X, and an application made by Mr. X for his minor children, so that there are then before the administrative agency three claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.178" offset="13752090">The next step in this hierarchy is for the Social Security Administration at the field level to investigate these circumstances with field operators.</text>
