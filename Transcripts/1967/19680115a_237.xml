            <text syncTime="26.578" offset="209690">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Tennessee to review a 16-year old boy’s conviction and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.724" offset="266219">Because the primary question in this case is whether the total circumstances surrounding petitioner's identification and its use at trial violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.256" offset="324420">I intend to state the facts in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.446" offset="349184">On the night of January 22, 1965 Mrs. Margaret Beamer, a Negro nurse was sewing in the living room of her Nashville, Tennessee home.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.801" offset="402578">Her 12-year old daughter was in a bedroom, listening to phonograph records and a six-year old son was asleep in another bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.585" offset="441762">The living room was a lit by a single lamp and the lights were off in an adjoining hallway and kitchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.110" offset="479796">At about 9:10 pm Mrs. Beamer rose and entered this hallway.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.510" offset="505396">She was grabbed from behind and pushed to the floor by an intruder holding a long butcher knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.737" offset="534340">She began to scream and sob, and her 12-year old daughter came to the door of the adjacent bedroom and also began to scream when she saw her mother and the assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.889" offset="590973">Intruder then said, “Shut up or I'll kill you both, to the women,” and he had Mrs. Beamer order her daughter back into the bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.871" offset="630888">He then forced her to walk through an unlit kitchen, out behind the house up in an embankment to some railroads tracks and took her to a place in the woods where he raped her.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.025" offset="687522">The only light behind the house came from the moon, streetlights which were located in front of the house; there were no lights on the tracks.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.257" offset="804446">These events lasted from 10 to 30 minutes at the most and Mrs. Beamer testified that throughout she was frightened in fear and crying.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.955" offset="859199">After the rape, the rapist ran away and Mrs. Beamer reported the crime to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.734" offset="890337">After she did this at dates and times and under circumstances which the record does not particularly reveal, she was shown 30 or 40 photographs from police files and saw a several suspects at headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.998" offset="975391">However, the record is quite clear that she never was shown the petitioner in this case at these viewings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1101.219" offset="4508296">It's our position that this case is controlled by the Court's decision in Stovall, where a show up or exhibiting a defendant alone was permitted only because there was no other way to have any identification proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.741" offset="4574333">But in this case a line up was imminently practical. Petitioner was in custody and continuously available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.125" offset="4611845">Mrs. Beamer was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.980" offset="4623339">There was no shortage of persons to hold the line up, Biggers was taken from a juvenile detention facility to a police headquarters in a large city, in the daytime, a city in which there are approximately 75,000 Negroes and if some short delay was required not shown by the record, it would not have been prejudicial because the crime had taken place seven months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.666" offset="4742040">The dangers of the show up procedure are well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.986" offset="4755310">They were mentioned in the court's opinions last term, presenting a man alone says there is reason to believe he is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.160" offset="4788015">This is the very question which the identification is supposed to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.354" offset="4808808">It also magnifies any similarities between the defendant and the criminal because there is no opportunity for comparison and it affords no test of recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.302" offset="4864606">Now these dangers worked a particularly harsh result here, because of a number of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.507" offset="4893445">Mrs. Beamer's initial opportunity to observe had been slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.645" offset="4913925">The crime took place in a very short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.759" offset="4930435">She never saw the rapist in direct light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.444" offset="4941197">Indeed the state concedes in one of its briefs that it was a limited opportunity, and she was understandably frightened and in fear of her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.246" offset="4976306">Again the state concedes she was emotionally upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.947" offset="4995114">Secondly, the gap between the crime and identification was great and her memory must have faded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.951" offset="5019146">And thirdly, she relied on her memory of her voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.027" offset="5031476">She didn't identify him until after he spoke. Memory of a voice is a particularly abstract and unreliable factor on which to base an identification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.700" offset="6894216">Well in these circumstances are in Stovall case, the good to be done in that case was that here was the victim, the only person that could identify the defendant, she was not expected to delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.470" offset="6953253">I don't what her condition of mind was at that particular time but it seemingly might not have been or its possibility, I'll say you that, that it was not as good as if she had not been expected or if she had been expected to delay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.265" offset="7020440">But under those circumstances the suspect or the accused was carried to the hospital by himself and this Court held in that case that because of the circumstances it was imperative that the identification be made under those circumstances that was not -- then amount to a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.991" offset="7103300">In this case the circumstances were different but I think in line with the same rule of law, Mrs. Beamer had over the time and I don't know how often it occurred or how regular, but she had identified to the State by opposing counsel she had looked at, she had looked at 30 or 40 photographs, none of them were the defendant, she said and I have an explanation for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.612" offset="7201834">That is he didn't have it, he had no police record, he had no, the police had no photographs of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.615" offset="7229837">She looked at several people during that time, didn't say how often or how regular but during -- from January 22 to August 17, she looked at several people none of them were the man that she -- the man that attacked her or she didn't identify any as the man who attacked her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.508" offset="7313429">I think the reason for that is that this was the first time he had been taken into custody by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.069" offset="7335685">That I think shows the reliability of her testimony but the point that I was going to make, over this period of time I think the police had decided whether rightly or wrongly is impossibility to have a lineup and counsel opponent for ever person that Ms. Beamer might, that might be a suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.239" offset="7408306">I think they -- I believe from one inference that could be drawn from the record is that that they really had given up on finding the person who raped Ms. Beamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.762" offset="7466402">Since that is a case and since this investigation was continuing over long period of time I think the totality of the circumstances made it impossible, and seemed to me like not warranted in going through all the procedure that you'd go through in identifying a hot prospect immediately after the incident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.199" offset="7584162">I think it had become obvious to the police by this time that Ms. Beamer if she was emotionally upset, and I suggest in my brief that she was, I don't know that there's anything that indicates that she was upset, she was frightened by the time, but over a period of seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.125" offset="7651871">She had looked at several pictures, she had seen several, she had looked at 30 or 40 pictures, she had seen several people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.526" offset="7981432">That is saying her identification prior to the lineup or identification given at trial prior to lineup, she's saying, “he looks like he does now except his hair was shorter I believe it was at time the incident occurred.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.129" offset="8059904">She also said this, she said that, “His shirt was open when he got on top of me I could see that he had -- I could tell or he had a big flabby breast and that he had a fat abdomen.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.827" offset="8114657">Now, nobody disputed that, this was seven months prior to the time of the trial if the defendant didn't meet that description at that time, he would, he had been given notice or she had testified that it was up to him to refute that kind of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.747" offset="8174320">So I think she did yield considerable evidence about what he looked like at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.074" offset="8199711">She also said his voice, that she had some teenage boys and that his voice sounded considerably like those boys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.365" offset="8232835">Now, here is a point I want to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.169" offset="8244015">After she saw the defendant and I say in my brief that circumstance were limited, they're always limited to some extent, in this advancement, she said, she has never seen him before the attack, she didn't see him between the time of attack, then the arrest, and the arrest until she got down to police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.755" offset="8314441">But she said there was light only in the hall, he threw her down in the hallway of her home I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.100" offset="8343803">She said that she looked up into his face, she saw him, she saw him in the home too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.985" offset="8367313">It's not clear just how much she saw him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.271" offset="8376508">It looks like the daughter might have had -- does not, have got an opportunity to see him as Ms. Beamer, the daughter said she couldn't identify him but I won't say -- daughter did relate some circumstances about his appearance that corroborated what her mother had said about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.063" offset="8447666">But after she saw him at the police headquarters and incidentally one of the policemen said, there were five policemen present, the defendant said in the room where he was identified there were two policemen Ms. Beamer and another woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.211" offset="8516211">Now that's I think an important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.494" offset="8529377">It's argued that with five policemen present that that of itself suggested maybe Ms. Beamer wouldn't, didn't feel to free speak up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.343" offset="8560724">Well, I think what the policemen say, and there were five policemen around the headquarters, but the defendant's testimony is there were two policemen in the room where the identification took place, Ms. Beamer and another woman.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.418" offset="10041031">But this was the first time he had been in police headquarters and I may have added that they didn't have his picture, but I just think the inference to be drawn is if he hadn't been there, if they haven't arrested him, he had no police record, they didn't have any pictures to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.307" offset="10104560">I think that attempt to show that she was careful and that she had time to cool off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.664" offset="10134026">I know what Mr. Walsh (ph) treat his own eyewitness identification, he says the length of time is the matter to be considered, but in this case, I think that that was favorable to the state's position because this lady had taken her time, she had cooled off and had made it evident that she wasn't desperate to identify anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.838" offset="10214693">She'll just wait until the right man came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.208" offset="10228172">Now her daughter's testimony, her daughter couldn't identify the assailant, but her daughter gave this same description of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.613" offset="10273834">She says that he had long hair -- she had -- that he was large, that he was a member of the Negro race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.091" offset="10319705">One other identifying feature that her mother had given, I have forgotten exactly what it is, I have got the citation here I believe on page 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.692" offset="10358157">She even said I don't know if this is material, but the daughter even said that the defendant had on a short sleeve shirt, well isn't her mother testified that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.078" offset="10395669">That may not be material, but it certainly corroborates to some extent about what her mother had to say about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.698" offset="10434121">Now the – as I said before, I know it would have been some protection if counsel had been present, but the purpose of having counsel there is have to reconstruct what happened, the arguments made because this is a boy and he wouldn't know how to protect himself and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.865" offset="10534849">I don't really think that enters into this question because certainly under Wade and Gilbert, there's never been a doubt about until now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.951" offset="10571212">A defendant can be made to testify I mean make the statement for the purpose of – knowing what his – how his voice sound, but I don't know anything that counsel could have done if it had been there except to reconstruct circumstances and it is not shown that the defendant was handicapped in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.983" offset="10651355">He was 16-year old boy, but I don't know that means he couldn't have been as observant as any, as an adult all he had to do was, he was panicked and could recite what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.436" offset="10705168">So we think that that is not really sufficient to say that it amounts to denial of due process in this case because the counsel weren't apprised.</text>
