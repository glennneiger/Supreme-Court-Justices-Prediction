            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="32.273" offset="232469">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.529" offset="241455">I hope the Court will indulge me, I had about with myringitis this week and I seem to be losing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.924" offset="267055">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Florida District Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.342" offset="288789">That issue is the constitutionality of a rule adapted by the Florida Industrial Commission that an employee who is otherwise eligible for unemployment compensation will automatically forfeit that entitlement by filing a charge with the National Labor Relations Board protesting his layoff for discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.673" offset="378023">The facts in this case are quite simple and we think rather neatly demonstrate how this rule was going to work in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.027" offset="411460">The petitioner was a member of the Steel Workers Union which was the bargaining agent at her plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.866" offset="434866">They caught -- the bargaining agreement came to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.023" offset="447509">The parties had been unable to negotiate a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.013" offset="459421">A strike was called and the petitioner participated in that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.033" offset="479483">The strike was to save at least the flop.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.631" offset="493902">It was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.568" offset="497664">The company kept operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.587" offset="505710">And as a result, after a few weeks the union on behalf of all the employees announced that all of them were prepared to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.475" offset="541236">The company took back some of the employees including petitioner but did not take back some of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.648" offset="569971">Now, petitioner made no claim for unemployment benefits during the period of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.142" offset="587943">Florida, as does, I think every state denies unemployment during the period of the strike and no claim was made during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.911" offset="623052">But three or four weeks after petitioner had come back to work, the company advised her that she was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.413" offset="649070">She was laid off said the company because we don't have enough work to keep you busy.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.773" offset="670490">And so she applied for unemployment benefits and began to receive them.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.123" offset="683865">This is the typical case on which unemployment is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.189" offset="704136">Three weeks thereafter, as petitioner saw many of her fellow participants in the strike also being laid off, she and they decided that perhaps the real reason they had been laid off was not as the company said because there wasn't enough work but rather because as a means of retaliation for them having participated in the earlier strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.628" offset="789922">And so, petitioner and her fellow laid off workers asked and got the union to file on their behalf the charge with the National Labor Relations Board asserting that the real reason they had been laid off a month earlier and were still on layoff was because they had favored the union and was as a means of retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.417" offset="877066">Now, though the procedures are complicated with the Florida Industrial Commission ultimately held was that petitioner was entitled to have received her unemployment compensation as she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.213" offset="920221">For the first four weeks of that layoff because as the Commission said, during that time she did not challenge the layoff but said the commission the moment she filed that charge with the Labor Board, she automatically disqualified herself and forfeited any right to further unemployment compensation because said the commission, we will deem the filing of the charge the creation of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.920" offset="1027009">And through some artificial means that I frankly cannot comprehend, we will now say that having filed that charge, her unemployment is caused by a labor dispute though we don't say that for the first four weeks while she remained silent that it was caused by the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.840" offset="1098689">So we have a ruling which is a little bit hard to square with Florida's own statute but of course we can interpret it as it will that if a company says you are laid off for economic reasons, you are until you dispute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.431" offset="1153128">And at the moment you dispute it the active dispute, the active going to the National Labor Relations Board causes your unemployment to be due to the labor dispute.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="271.214" offset="1188237">Oh, I suppose the theory would be that she could not be heard to say that the layoff was not caused by a labor dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.935" offset="1219062">And she's the one who said it was that -- she was laid off because of her union activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.312" offset="1260648">It could -- but if that were the theory, I don't even think it's that because if that were the theory, you would disqualify her for the whole period since what she's complaining about is not all of a sudden it became an empty union layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.022" offset="1303489">What she's saying is the whole period of my layoff has been from my union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.998" offset="1319372">So if the theory is that she can't be heard to contest what she claims, the theory would have to be let's disqualify her for the entire period.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.298" offset="1348524">But it's clear indeed and that that's not what Florida is doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.812" offset="1358660">What Florida is saying is regardless of why you're laid off, we'll pay you your unemployment compensation as long as you remain meek and dazzle but the moment you go to the big fat Federal government, we're going to disqualify you.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.891" offset="1398888">That's exactly what they said and that's exactly what they've done.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.270" offset="1472449">That's true because the Florida Industrial Commission itself affirmed without opinion and the Florida District Court and Appeals denied certiorari which I assume does not constitute a ruling on the merits though it necessarily means under their law that it found no important question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="368.153" offset="1575999">Yes that there was at the time, sir it was -- originally petitioned for here, the dispute is to whether there was a right of appeal to the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.462" offset="1613197">The claim has not been renewed on the merits now.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.722" offset="1622288">We answered it fully in our replied brief at the time of the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.690" offset="1642141">There is no right of appeal from the District Court's denial of certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.834" offset="1662725">The only way this case could have gone further is that the Florida District Court had certified it to the Supreme Court as an important question and it thought it's so unimportant not even to hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.200" offset="1704208">So it certainly -- that is in fact the case did not certify it to the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.902" offset="1726986">But the fact is this case is -- the same rule is being enforced in many other cases and has been approved in some Florida cases with opinions one of which is cited in the respondent's brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.399" offset="1781008">Now the way the Florida rule is going to work I think is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.755" offset="1802428">Florida is saying to the employees who think they've been laid off in violation of the federal law, “You have a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.641" offset="1829909">If you remain quiet then you will receive what amounts to cash under about a 50 bucks a week from the moment you're laid off you'll get it when you needed it which is while you're unemployed or your other choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.019" offset="1883408">If you think you've been unlawfully laid off is to go file a charge with the National Labor Relations Board which to be sure may ultimately reward you with more money because you will get the full amount of your back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.695" offset="1930115">But there are two problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.874" offset="1938892">One is that as this case demonstrates, it is literally years till you collect from the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.645" offset="1961984">In this case, the Labor Board's decision came down two years and three months after the charge was filed and it's now still pending in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.422" offset="1997093">And if you are hungry while you are laid off, that late arrival of the money is not going to help pretty much.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.142" offset="2019976">And the second problem of course is you just might lose before the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.617" offset="2033873">Many people do.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.099" offset="2039724">In which case, by having taken that gamble you'll lose everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.335" offset="2056756">So that it is not hard to imagine that in the future, very few people are going to go to the National Labor Relations Board when they're in this circumstance in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.711" offset="2090193">Only those who can afford the gamble that is, who have enough money to feed themselves in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.348" offset="2120808">And they are willing to take the chance they might lose everything instead to take this assured $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.032" offset="2139512">Only those people and I think there'll be few are going to choose to go to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.009" offset="2167411">And the consequence that's going to have on the enforcement of federal law I think is also quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.402" offset="2188936">The Labor Board as has been mentioned in the earlier case through comparison, the Labor Board is not a self enforcing agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.031" offset="2223522">It can entertain a case and investigate a case only when a charge is filed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.663" offset="2242017">If Florida successfully persuades unemployed people they better not file charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.493" offset="2261347">Charges will not be filed with the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.709" offset="2270229">If they're not filed the Labor Board does not have authority to correct violations of federal law, does not have authority to enforce the public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.059" offset="2307636">If they're not filed, employers are going to discover a very easy way to combat unionization as the Labor Board points out in its amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.229" offset="2340237">All it need do as unionization begins is to start laying people off for economic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.439" offset="2361135">The employees will not fail to get the message but they'll be foolhardy if they challenge so long as the Florida rule here is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.848" offset="2402722">For these reasons, we submit as the Labor Board in its amicus brief that the Florida rule clearly violates the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.239" offset="2436368">We have a National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.007" offset="2443368">We have a board whose job it is to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.415" offset="2452982">It's enforcing a public policy not a private interest as is asserted by the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.067" offset="2483597">In enforcing that public policy, it's dependent upon the people who are injured coming to it and Florida is preventing those people from coming to it by imposing a penalty where they're coming to.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.911" offset="2527065">We think it's clear, we've cited many cases that demonstrate that it's clear that Florida just can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.813" offset="2554650">There is also a second basis upon which we challenge the constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.749" offset="2570324">Now, with what Florida is doing here, looking at it not from the interest of the Federal government but from the interest of the individual who is putting this dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.935" offset="2603133">We say that that person has a constitutional right to go to the Federal government and to ask for its protection and to ask for the enforcement of its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.125" offset="2639914">And that what Florida is doing here is exacting a price for exercising that constitutional right which it may not permissibly do.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.232" offset="2676276">No -- it's easier to assert that there is such a constitutional right to go to the government than it is to say precisely where that right comes from because I think if this case arose for the first time today, this question, the likely source of that right would be the First Amendment which creates a right to petition the government as it has been incorporated or read into the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.709" offset="2758196">But ironically, this question first got discussed by this Court before the First Amendment had been incorporated into the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.188" offset="2784110">It first got discussed in Slaughterhouse cases in 1873.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.597" offset="2801768">And in those cases in which this Court virtually read the privileges and immunities clause out of the Fourteenth Amendment, it felt the certain responsibility to say that there was some content left to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.066" offset="2839594">There's some reason why that clause was put into this amendment and it said the purpose of this amendment of the privileges and immunities clause is to protect those rights which are inherently those of national citizenship that relate to the rights of the citizen with the Federal government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.994" offset="2907303">It then went on to enumerate some examples which might very well have been to this case the right to petition the Federal government for the aid and comfort and assistance, the right to inform the Federal government of violations of its laws, the right to deal with the Federal government to assist it in carrying out its functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.934" offset="2979088">These are the privileges and immunities enumerated in the Slaughterhouse cases repeated in many cases since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.101" offset="3003747">And these are precisely the kinds of things which the petitioner in this case was trying to do when she had her charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.460" offset="3053171">Now, it's true, I might say, Privileges and Immunities Clause uses the same operative verb as the First Amendment abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.496" offset="3081383">No state may abridge the privileges and immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.536" offset="3097475">And it's true that Florida has not abridged them here by making it a crime to go to the Labor Board nor has it attached the act of going to the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.047" offset="3135509">But we take it clear from any of this Court cases under the First Amendment that what Florida has done which is to impose a penalty which amounts to a financial penalty for going to the Labor Board constitutes the kind of abridgement which is forbidden by the Privileges and Immunities clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.274" offset="3208443">It's true as respondent contends that unemployment compensation benefits are a privilege, not a right and that therefore in large measure the state is free to dispense them as it will to give them to everyone or to no one or to classify them as it would like.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.995" offset="3279391">But it's also clear that there is one limitation on the state's right to dispense its privileges and that limitation is that it may not condition the recede of them upon the foregoing of the constitutional right or the federal constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1174.698" offset="4802121">At the outset, let me note that the Florida Industrial Commission which is itself a co-respondent here and which is presumably the voice of the state has not seen fit the file of brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.439" offset="4849142">We would think if there were in fact some compelling state interests to the kind which would justify the interference with the constitutional rights, that the state agency that's administering the statute would have thought enough to have come and told this Court what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.820" offset="4902640">The fact is indeed that there are no such compelling state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.949" offset="4915179">None were asserted in the decision of the appeals referee in this case or anywhere up the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.115" offset="4939839">And the only one which the company having labored so hard is able to come up with clearly is not the kind of compelling state interest that would warrant the infringement with constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.498" offset="4981321">The company is alleged compelling state interest is that the state has an interest in avoiding dual compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.356" offset="5008802">A state has a right to say we don't want to give you unemployment benefits when there's a chance you're also going to collect from the Labor Board and therefore get double recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.807" offset="5042552">And the simple answer to that concern is that it's not a real concern because this Court said many, many years ago that if an employee after collecting unemployment compensation does get benefits from the Labor Board, you, the State of Florida in administering your Unemployment Compensation Act are free to recoup back the unemployment benefits you've paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.049" offset="5123532">Now the fact is, State of Florida since that decision has not chosen to setup any such procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.926" offset="6691088">It is rather complicated and we in our petition for certiorari oppose the jurisdiction of this Court because that first -- the first impression that we have was that the state court procedure had not been exhausted but then after taking another look at it while we came to the conclusion that probably that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.299" offset="6768619">So whether not the State Supreme Court of Florida will be reviewing one of these cases any time soon before the decision of this Court is forthcoming is not known but it is a rather complicated procedure and if this has anything to do with the absence of an attorney from the Attorney General's Office from the State of Florida have no way of knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.397" offset="6880946">But in any event, they did not file the brief but authorized me to appear orally for the commission at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.506" offset="6925354">So basically, that is the problem before the Court and we think that the issue concerning this ruling is the reasonableness of this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.961" offset="6971225">In other words, is the determination of the Board of Review to the extent that the filing of an unfair labor practice charge for the NLRB unreasonable not one of whether or not the privileges and immunities of this petitioner is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.816" offset="7034650">It is our position that privileges and immunities has no place or no application in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.466" offset="7073207">Now, we say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.680" offset="7086059">It is my understanding that in order for that doctrine to come into play and to be an issue and in order for that Section of the Fourteenth Amendment to be violated, we first of all have to be dealing with a right of national citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.069" offset="7159620">Now, its our contention that we are dealing with a group of employees, a limited number of employees in this particular area and these employees must be persons that not only can go to the State Unemployment Compensation Board and file a claim for unemployment compensation but must also be at the same time and in the same position of being eligible or able to file an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board and have this charge processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.261" offset="7316459">Now, no right of national citizenship is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.589" offset="7333700">The right or the -- in order to qualify for both of these positions, first of all, the person must be an employee and insofar as the federal aspect of the situation is concerned, the person must be an employee of an employer engaged in an interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.362" offset="7408828">It has nothing to do with citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.746" offset="7418337">If this Court held that this rule was invalid because it violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, you would be in effect holding that in order to first file an unfair labor practice charge within NLRB you would have to be a citizen of the United States of America and this is not the case nor was this result intended by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.569" offset="7713625">Now secondly, the petitioner advances as a reason for striking down this ruling of the Florida Industrial Commission that it violates the Supremacy Clause and in support of this position, primarily relies upon two cases one is Davis against Elmira State Bank and the other one is Hill against Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.329" offset="7804740">Now we think that the approach taken in these two cases even if the Supremacy Clause is involved here is not applicable and does not furnish any sufficient or adequate guidelines for determination that we must make here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.234" offset="7872345">The Elmira State Bank case involved a state statute and a federal statute that were in direct conflict as to what was to be done with the remaining assets of insolvent banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.475" offset="7921246">In other words, these two statutes ran head on and in Hill against Florida that involved a statute that imposed certain conditions upon labor organizations and business agents before they could decay on business within the State of Florida and this Court held there that the determination that was being made by the legislature and the penalties imposed such as a complete injunction against functioning as a labor organization altogether did violate the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.313" offset="8060635">We do not think that we are faced with such a situation here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.422" offset="8077040">What -- rather what we are faced with is the reasonableness of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.313" offset="8096580">This Court has held on a number of occasions that it's only inquiry and it's only purpose in reviewing such a case would be to determine the reasonableness of the rule advanced by the Unemployment Compensation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.245" offset="8160319">Now I think first of all we have to look at the reason that these statutes both federal and state were originally passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.349" offset="8204727">That's my understanding that the purpose of this statutes which were passed back in 1935, 1936 in that particular area was to alleviate mass unemployment rather than come into play in a particular situation that we have or that we are faced with here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.158" offset="8284035">In other words, the reason for this legislation in our opinion is not present when we consider what the purpose of the rule of the Florida Board of Review or the reason behind that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.072" offset="8347669">Now, this Court has had a number of occasions to review various rulings of industrial commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.060" offset="8387584">Once such rule was reviewed in the Oregon case, which had been cited in both briefs here today, that case involved is a situation in Alaska where you have seasonal employees and these seasonal employees finished their work in 1939 then before the season started in 1940, and a collective bargaining agreement had not been negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.024" offset="8487476">There were some attempts to prove that an impasse had been reached in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.057" offset="8515584">And even if negotiations had continued it would not have been successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.503" offset="8537422">This Court held that the disqualification of these employees, these seasonal employees from receiving these benefits even though no collective bargaining agreement had been reached and even though there might have been an impasse reached in, future negotiations would not have been helpful anyway that this disqualification was not so unreasonable as to strike it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.671" offset="8646092">Secondly, as pointed out by Mr. Gottesman and this is the point that I think that it -- that the petitioner has failed to get around and that is the fact that in all studies and I think with the approval of this Court, employment, unemployment compensation benefits will be denied where the employees are engaged in a strike situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.040" offset="8759568">Not true as Mr. Gottesman points out the employment -- unemployment there is voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.974" offset="8791228">The employee for one reason or another has decided not to cross the picket line and come into work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.587" offset="8817768">However, in this instance where the employee files an unfair labor practice charge, the employee also is contending that, “No, I am not unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.052" offset="8871581">I was discharged unlawfully and therefore I am entitled to my job back, reinstatement with full back pay”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.814" offset="8902614">Now, there is a certain choice on the part of the employee in that situation and for the Florida Board of Review to determine that this creates a disqualifying labor dispute does not seem so unreasonable to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.779" offset="8970533">In other words if unemployment compensation can be denied when an employee is striking and particularly if that employee is engaging in picketing and supporting a strike which has been held to be a First Amendment freedom then we feel that there is no basis and no reason for saying that when the employee voluntarily chooses to go before the National Labor Relations Board that also a labor dispute has been created.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2463.697" offset="9958170">But certainly to the extent its constitutional for Florida to deny workmen's compensation to do a strike, there is, is there not a burden on the right to strike?</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.915" offset="10027029">And the right to strike is guaranteed with Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Board?</text>

            <label>Mr. Glenn L. Greene, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2485.455" offset="10045210">I don't necessarily think that there is a particular burden on the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.385" offset="10064959">I think that -- well if there is, I don't think it's unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.548" offset="10085543">The reasons behind the decisions in the strike cases is, as I understand them is that -- first of all the state does not want to be put in the position of financing a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.125" offset="10127862">Secondly, the employer should not be put in the position in effect subsidize a dispute involving his particular business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.716" offset="10174255">Now, I think going on to this particular review that the same reasons there are applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.030" offset="10219499">The employer is nevertheless put in the same position if he has to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.362" offset="10252831">Secondly, I see no unreasonable requirement put up on the employee if he has to spend some time or some -- I don't -- by that I don't mean days or weeks but give some problem as to whether or not he in effect has a legitimate grievance before the Labor Board and if not then he can go to the state unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.937" offset="10371114">I don't think that the situation calls for this court to hand down a decision striking down a decision of the Florida Board of Rewiew which was in effect guarantee the empolyee in what the right to draw unemployment compensation and still go before the National Labor Relations Board and attack this discharge on the grounds of union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.850" offset="10498800">I think that's what it boils down to, the fact that the state can go against the employee and recoup whatever unemployment compensation benefits were gained by the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.327" offset="10560658">There's not necessarily at least in my opinion eliminate the problem still places an undo burden, we think on the employer and also as pointed out in the conclusion of our brief, it can lead to three separate cases of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.710" offset="10638190">A conflict between the state and the employee on unemployment compensation claim, a claim for back pay with the Federal government before the National Labor Relations Board and then in turn a suit by the state against the employee to recoup the unemployment compensation benefits if back pay is awarded by the Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.433" offset="10721155">And for these reasons, we do not feel that the petitioner have sustained the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.013" offset="10755427">He has pointed out that there is a burden on the state to come forward and show a compelling atmosphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.503" offset="10777370">But there is not a burden on the state to do this until the petitioner has shown that there is some constitutional question raised by this decision of the Florida Board of Review and we do not feel that there is a submission -- issue to be passed on by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.110" offset="10851767">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.223" offset="10876217">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.288" offset="10888547">I'm tempted to try it again where I probably shouldn't tread which is the dilemma that Mr. Justice White has exposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.783" offset="10914461">Each of us argue one thing for this case and would like something else for the others that are afraid and don't know quite how far to tread.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.595" offset="10953749">Obviously, we think, it was -- I've indicated, we think the denial of unemployment compensation to strikers is also a violation of law or it is also unconstitutional I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.175" offset="11000038">But I do think there is a difference and the question is different and I do think that it's important to identify what the difference is because it really is not essential perhaps desirable for this Court to decide both questions at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.338" offset="11052701">And the difference as we see it is this, Florida has a general policy of not compensating involuntary -- I'm sorry, voluntary unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.194" offset="11092198">Florida has a right it seems to us as a general rule to adopt a general construction or a general division of its unemployment compensation and only those who had a choice or who had no choice who are unemployed against their will shall receive unemployment compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2764.241" offset="11160325">But that choice is in -- but you never lest -- I would say that that's -- is unconstitutional.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="2769.138" offset="11179969">Yes, but it's a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.327" offset="11184671">The question we have here is the same as that in Sherbert versus Verner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.602" offset="11197733">The difference is that here, Florida is making an exception from its own rules to reach this and that clearly we think is a reaching out to punish the exercise of constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.790" offset="11238484">The question in the other case is whether Florida in applying its own general rule which is we won't compensate voluntary absence, nonetheless, though it is a part of a general rule is so infringing upon a federally protected interest that in balancing the Florida's general rule against the abrasion of the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.282" offset="11324479">The balance should be struck in favor of the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.479" offset="11337331">That issue really is the one that was involved in Sherbert versus Verner where the state had a general rule that those who did -- would not accept available work would be disqualified from unemployment compensation but that rule wasn't limited to or singled out for Sabbatarians, it was a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.789" offset="11406503">But nevertheless when they applied it to someone who could not take available work because it was work that occurred on a Saturday and she was Sabbatarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.780" offset="11438477">Though it was the application of a general rule, this Court struck it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.930" offset="11455091">And they struck it down because it said that the state interest involve were not sufficiently great.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.241" offset="11500335">It raises the question of the same context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.758" offset="11510366">The context of the application of a general state rule which everyone would concede is in most instances alright to -- in a particular situation where to do so robs against the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.619" offset="11557804">Whereas, what we have here is not the application of a general rule but the exception from a general rule for the sole purpose of reaching a federal interest which we think is in a sense an easier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.737" offset="11598346">Whereas I say we think Sherbert and Verner and the approach and the reasoning there may very well lead to the proposition that you cannot deny unemployment compensation to the striker.</text>
