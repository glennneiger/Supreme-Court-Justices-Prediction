            <label>Mr. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="14.821" offset="162670">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.574" offset="177716">This is a tax case involving a rather narrow question of statutory construction with respect to a matter as to which there is very little specific in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.312" offset="252635">And therefore, it seems to me that it is essentially a question of tax administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.907" offset="283042">The statutory provisions which are involved, there are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.812" offset="302582">They are set forth at the bottom of page 2 of the Government's main brief, Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code allows the taxpayer to deduct the necessary expenses of carrying on a trade or business including, and these are the words; traveling expenses including the entire amount spent for meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.768" offset="454405">And if that statutory provision was the only one there was, I suppose this problem would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.970" offset="487215">There is however another section of the statute, a section which I may say was not mentioned in the opinion of the court below at Section 262 which provides except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.732" offset="558268">No deduction shall be allowed for a personal living or family expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.890" offset="594944">The question arises on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.505" offset="613439">The taxpayer is a salesman whose home is in Fountain City, Tennessee, which I understand to be a suburb of Knoxville.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.922" offset="667042">He is one of some 16-group salesmen who works for a wholesale grocery company named Hale Brothers Incorporated which has its headquarters in Morristown, Tennessee, which is about 50 miles away from Fountain City.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.222" offset="752306">Each salesman has a territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.055" offset="767561">One or two have accounts only in their own hometowns.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.690" offset="794102">Some others have larger territories and make at least occasional overnight trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.038" offset="827538">But the taxpayer in this case left home each morning about 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning, made calls in several cities and towns and returned home between 4:30 and 5:00 in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.430" offset="913115">And the simple question in this case is whether this taxpayer is entitled to deduct in computing his taxable income, the cost of his two meals during that day, breakfast and lunch, which he usually had on the premises of his customers at places known to his employer so that his employer would be able to get in touch with him if there was any matter that he wanted to communicate to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.799" offset="1082598">I think I should also mention that there is pending before the Court another case, the William A. Bagley against the United States, against the commissioner, Number 155, in which a petition for a writ of certiorari has been applied for which is essentially in conflict with the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.727" offset="1190327">And the Court has not taken action on that petition.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="276.005" offset="1207359">What circuit was that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="277.488" stopTime="958.461">
            <label>Mr. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="277.488" offset="1213315">That's from the First Circuit with if I may say so an excellent opinion by Judge Aldrich which is included in the petition in that case and that which seems to me they present a very fine analysis of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.563" offset="1289592">The Bagley case is similar to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.293" offset="1308505">It's a little different in that it involves the free meals per day whereas the present case involves the two meals per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.700" offset="1350196">In the Bagley case, the taxpayer was an engineer who had retired from a job at General Electric and did consulting work.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.671" offset="1402023">He kept his office in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.619" offset="1417801">He was a widower, lived alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.388" offset="1436923">The evidence was that he didn't like to cook or wash dishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.957" offset="1455208">He left home in the morning at 6 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.259" offset="1472449">He often did not return until 9:00 or 10:00 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.429" offset="1489063">Sometimes traveled 100 miles during the day and took three meals; breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.131" offset="1527933">All of which he sought to deduct under Section 162 and the First Circuit held that none of them were deductible essentially under Section 262.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.691" offset="1602121">The statutory provision in its present form goes back to 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.116" offset="1635871">The earlier statute had simply allowed the deduction of business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.732" offset="1658337">And the Commissioner had first ruled that this allowed the deduction of travel expenses that is transportation expenses fares, but that it did not allowed the deduction of anything for meals and lodging, that that was barred by Section 262 since meals in particular were something which the taxpayer had to provide for himself anyway and it was a personal living or family expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.391" offset="1792920">Later under that statute in 1920, the Commissioner put out a new regulation in which he said that the taxpayer could deduct the additional amount which he was required to expend on account of meals and lodging over and above what he would have had to expend if he had not been in a travel status.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.612" offset="1885811">And the treasury of course immediately found that extremely difficult to administer because it was terribly hard to know what the additional amount was.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.849" offset="1930742">Some people might live rather high at home and therefore couldn't deduct very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.104" offset="1955819">And other people who are very frugal at home might be able to show a larger deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.724" offset="1982255">And it was in 1921 that Dr. T.S. Adams, the treasury's expert and adviser, appeared before Congress and recommended on behalf of the treasury, the statutory provision which is still in effect in essence allowing the deduction of the entire amount spent for meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of the trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.594" offset="2113703">Curiously enough, the particular question was which we are concerned does not seem to have a reason for the next 20 years or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.211" offset="2164172">I suppose that was because of high exemptions and relatively low rates which were involved at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.274" offset="2196459">However, it was very early established and there were decisions of the Tax Court in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.667" offset="2234075">The first -- the very first volume of then it was the Board of Tax Appeals, and there had been administrative rulings as early as 1919 that the commuter could not deduct his meal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.607" offset="2293844">And there where even some cases involving two-meal commuters, that is the businessman or the lawyer might come in and not only have lunch but he had to work in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.241" offset="2344312">So he went out some place and had supper, and neither the lunch nor the supper was allowed as a deduction although I would point out that it could at least in some sense be regarded as coming within the literal language of the statute which allows the deduction of the entire amount expended for meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.484" offset="2449324">Now, this meant that very early, it was recognized that away from home, was an illusive verbal construct and required some rather careful consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.631" offset="2521945">As early as 1940, the treasury ruled in effect that no deduction could be had unless the taxpayer was required to be a way long enough to need a sleep or rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.677" offset="2602088">From 1944 to 1962, there were more than a dozen cases which supported what is sometimes called the Commissioner's “overnight rule” where he tried to draw the line by saying that you can't deduct meals unless you are away overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.332" offset="2688711">I think a more refined version of it is to call it the sleep or rest rule because cases that soon arose where taxpayers didn't necessarily sleep at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.145" offset="2743986">The railroad conductor who took a long trip and took a room for rest during the day returning on an evening run, the Commissioner in 1940s said that if he was required to take the room, that he could deduct not only the cost of the room but also the meals.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.736" offset="2842311">And the First Circuit Court of Appeals for some years ago held that whether he was required or not, if the length of the trip was such as to make it appropriate for him to seek rest in the course of the journey, he could deduct not only the cost of the lodging but also the meals.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.801" offset="2930604">Beginning in 1948, the Commissioner made this very specific in two places, actually beginning in 1946 which is 21 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.410" offset="2980968">And for the convenience of the Court, I printed the text of this in the reply brief which has been filed in the Correll case on page 11 of the reply brief are set out the instructions, the official instructions which the Commissioner has used with respect to Form 1040, the standard taxpayer return form.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.024" offset="3099460">And since 1948, these instructions have always specified as indicated that near at the top of page 11, the last sentence of the indented quotation traveling “away from home” means going away from the city or town where you normally work and remaining away at least overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.321" offset="3200606">And you'll find that phrase at least overnight in all the rest of the instructions right down through 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.592" offset="3241775">The 1967 instructions I believe have not yet appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.155" offset="3264031">In addition the Commissioner puts out a booklet called “Your Federal Income Tax,” and since 1946, as quoted at the bottom of the page 12, this booklet has specifically referred to require his absence overnight, at top of page 13 from which he does not return the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.029" offset="3383463">The 1955 edition is quoted at the bottom of page 13 in the last full line and remaining away at least overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.448" offset="3429125">You then find some modification beginning in the 59 and the 63 editions where there is a reference to necessitate relief from duty to obtain sleep or to obtain necessary sleep showing the transition to the sleep or rest rule which seems to me to be inappropriate and thoroughly sound than refinement of the originally stated overnight rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.846" offset="3562768">In 1954, the Internal Revenue Code was given a comprehensive revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.845" offset="3594742">And there was some reference to this problem in three situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.072" offset="3623685">In the first place at the hearings, a taxpayer appeared objected to the overnight rule and set it out to be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.120" offset="3659839">No change was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.911" offset="3667048">I don't put great significance in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.343" offset="3676766">I simply record it as one of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.806" offset="3702575">Two amendments were made to the statute in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.637" offset="3725876">One was the enactment of a Section 120 which specifically allowed a state policeman to deduct an amount of $5.00 a day and in the provision which is sent then repealed by Congress because it was found impossible to justify this special deduction for state policemen when such a deduction was not available for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.577" offset="3853667">But in the Committee Report with respect to that, Congress referred specifically to the fact that the application of the statute at that time allowed for the deduction for meals while away from home overnight.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="958.461" offset="3937259">What page is that recorded on in the agreement?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="961.366" stopTime="1375.269">
            <label>Mr. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="961.366" offset="3948857">That is on the -- this is on pages 17 and 18, and the exact quotation from the Committee Report is on page 18 about three inches from the top of the page for meals while away from home overnight, the overnight is printed in italics in the brief and those are italics, the Committee Report is simply printed in ordinary type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.426" offset="4105070">There was also another provision in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.306" offset="4128580">This problem arises not only with respect to the deduction in Section 162, but in a somewhat mildly complicated way with respect to the determination of adjusted gross income which for practical purposes means whether you can get the deduction and also take the standard deduction of 10% of your income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.775" offset="4234428">And until 1954, because of the way the statute was worded, there was a difference wholly unjustified between the taxpayer who paid his own travel expenses and the taxpayer who was reimbursed by his employer with respect to the travel expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.844" offset="4314781">When Congress straightened that out in 1954 by an amendment to Section 622 (c) and again, the Committee Report expressly refers to the fact that the Commissioner's rule is away from home overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.998" offset="4399313">Now there was no official dissent from that view until 1962 when the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeal decided a case called Hanson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.067" offset="4467649">There was an earlier case in the First Circuit which uses a language to the effect that the Commissioner's construction of the statute is something that he dreamed up but actually the First Circuit case involved a railroad conductor who took a long trip to a distant place, took a room for sleep or rest, and came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.292" offset="4564511">And as I've indicated the Commissioner has long since accepted that goes on the overnight rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.814" offset="4594604">But it was the Hanson case in the Eighth Circuit which first threw uncertainty into that picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.026" offset="4647476">I may mention just to complete the statutory history that in 1962, Section 162 was amended in a way which is not applicable here because the years involved here are 1960 and ‘61 but which is also clearly not relevant because what it did was simply to limit the deduction to amounts which are not leverage in amount and there's not suggestion that anything of that sort was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.997" offset="4775372">Finally in 1963, the treasury recommended to Congress that the statute be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.171" offset="4812048">This is referred to on pages 25 and 26 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.602" offset="4841827">The treasury suggested that the deduction be allowed where there was an absence of 16 hours or more and where substantial arrest was needed in connection with the travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.474" offset="4897311">It also suggested that there be a duty area which would be a circle of 20 miles radius.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.644" offset="4937958">Nothing came of this recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.975" offset="4947257">It was not reported out of the Committee on Ways and Means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.819" offset="4970663">And I mentioned that simply to complete the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.043" offset="5007548">Now, one can look at this statutory language and try to search out the “meaning of Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.429" offset="5069093">And I would suggest that that is a rather illusory matter because I find it difficult to find any evidence that Congress ever thought about this detailed application of the statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.963" offset="5139205">I would like to suggest to the Court that this is essentially a case of tax administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.204" offset="5164178">That Congress has committed the administration of this statute to the treasury has authorized the Commissioner to make appropriate rules and regulations and the Commissioner has made such rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.275" offset="5244426">They might may or may not be the same as a Court would make as an original proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.012" offset="5279431">But my thought would be that unless the Court finds that this is an unreasonable or wholly inappropriate construction and application of the statute, it should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.434" offset="5337109">There are two problems, or there is a problem arising from the application of these two statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.190" offset="5384129">I repeat, if there was Section 162 alone, I wouldn't doubt that these meal expenses would be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.694" offset="5422164">If there was Section 262 alone, no deduction allowed for personal family and living expenses seems to me equally declare that the meal expenses would not be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.065" offset="5467617">What you actually have then is the two statutory provisions; both obviously intended to be given some effect by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.973" offset="5507218">And the problem is to work out a practical administrable way to give appropriate application to these provisions and I suggest to at the same time, to provide a measure of equality of treatment between taxpayers who are similarly situated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.790" offset="6142516">Now, it seems to me that there are two rather narrow grounds on which this case can be put.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.266" offset="6172400">One is suggested by Judge Aldrich in the Bagley opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.805" offset="6198627">He says that the statute refers to meals and lodging, and that unless there's also lodging that maybe it can be argued that there's no deduction for meals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.221" offset="6248260">Another basis of dealing with the problem it seems to me would distinguish between the person who makes an occasional or sporadic business trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.971" offset="6295280">The New York lawyer who has a case before this Court comes down to Washington, goes back the same evening on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.288" offset="6340524">And taxpayers like the present taxpayer who does it regularly as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.303" offset="6368632">If the place of business, if home is the place of business, this taxpayer took his place of business along with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.164" offset="6411995">Among other things, it's a little hard to see why this taxpayer should be allowed to deduct two meals, both breakfast and lunch, when the similar situated taxpayer, indeed some of his fellow employees who work only in one community, are not allowed to deduct either meal and while the ordinary taxpayer can't deduct his lunch because that is of course a personal family or living expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.609" offset="6533831">The suggestion is made in some of the Court of Appeals decisions that each case must turn on its own facts that the questions must come up before the courts and be decided case by case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.285" offset="6604466">And I would suggest that that is a thoroughly unsound way to administer a tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.456" offset="6645217">Here we have a homely problem arising some 47 years after the statute was enacted, arising after some 20 years in which it was uniformly applied in decisions sustained by the courts, the problems arise only because the courts have sought to move into a problem which is essentially one of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.808" offset="6758588">And to say that this should be decided in each case by courts depending upon their separate facts as to use a phrase of my old colleague Professor Tomas Reed Powell to introduce a chaos of independent episodes instead of something approaching an orderly system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.890" offset="6846882">Of all kinds of questions that could arise, it seems to me that this is one which ought to be capable of determination in an orderly way that revenue agents and taxpayers can understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.148" offset="6903933">I think that there are numerous rules which might be applied here time away, distance away, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.513" offset="6941445">I don't see that anyone of them is any better than the rule of which the Commissioner has devised and has thought to apply over a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.833" offset="6978748">It would seem to me that sound and wise tax and judicial administration call for upholding the construction adopted by the Commissioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.046" offset="7407574">He did as a matter of course, stay overnight and the amount of his meals and lodging was allowed as a deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.676" offset="10118040">Under Section 62, in order to determine what the phrase “adjusted gross income,” the code section entitles the person to deduct travel expenses incurred while away from home under I think its 62 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.402" offset="13932962">Of course, the question of whether or not it was actually law or should be law is another matter for this Court to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.927" offset="13963055">But I would say that basically our rule is that again repeating is the fact that we must ascertain whether or not it is a legitimate travel status.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.877" offset="14142882">The very nature of the trial and whether or not, he is generated for business purposes throughout the code sections is constant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.882" offset="14182902">They're constantly setting up circumstances where the facts of each case must determine whether or not it is a business deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.413" offset="14212995">And we contend that that is a reasonable rule and it's a rule which has been enforced since the Revenue Code has been adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.853" offset="14306826">That this rule was distinguished between the commuter who comes from his home in Connecticut to the New York City in his office, and the man who gets on a jet liner and flies from New York to Chicago and has lunch and comes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.197" offset="14368162">Or it would distinguish between a situation of Mr. Correll's one day travel where his expenses are generated for business purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.863" offset="14406823">And we believe that this rule does not involve an artificial construction of Section 162 wherein the word “overnight” or sleep or rest is superimposed in that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.677" offset="14466069">And by virtue of this, that the code section would be construed and it's clear, and it's an ambiguous meaning, and thereby would be according to the intent of Congress.</text>
