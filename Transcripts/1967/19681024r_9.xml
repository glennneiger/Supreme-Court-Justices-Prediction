            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="10.314" offset="146641">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.133" offset="162001">Yesterday, I thought the show that the classification made by the one year prior residence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.080" offset="189691">Between old residence, on the one hand and new residence on the other, not only operates in relation to the fundamental necessities, rudiments of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.885" offset="244966">But also, that it is utterly unrelated to any of the avowed purposes of the public assistance laws, because the favored and the disfavored are identically situated in relation to the kind or extended their need or the suitability of the ADC program for parallel programs as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.629" offset="343918">In the absence of relation to some irrational relation to some other state policy therefore, that is enough to make -- re-submit an equal protection case in the classic sense of the distinction between a redheaded man and brown headed man or any other capricious classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.090" offset="445795">Now, I go on first this morning to point out that our case is stronger still because we have a situation in which the state has singled out for the purposes of this favor hospital treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.671" offset="524058">Those who exercise the fundamental liberty of moving to a new residence in pursuit of better opportunities, better life or what else they considered to be an advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.472" offset="587274">That discrimination we say, is not merely capricious but it is invidious in the same sense that discrimination on grounds of race or religion is invidious, and it also operates to deter the exercise of a right which underlies a number of the provisions of the constitution and of course, those provisions in turn, help to show that this is an invidious distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.106" offset="721857">That is one that our fundamental constitutional principles condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.217" offset="746308">I do want to emphasize that this line of thought brings me while it relies on the constitutional provisions dealing with freedom of migration.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.965" offset="785283">It brings me back ultimately to the equal protection clause and to the Equal Protection Clause cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.811" offset="816630">I stressed that because I think this analysis eases the Court's problem of decision and makes it unnecessary to break new constitutional ground in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.585" offset="863754">For example, one does not have under these circumstances to face up to the question, what exact clause of the constitution do you find this in?</text>
            <text syncTime="199.847" offset="904819">Equally, the fact that the District of Columbia's statute is involved is not relevant when one is talking about a classification as invidious as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.378" offset="954974">Whereas, technically, it might be of significance, if one will rely on Article 4 Section 2 alone or on the privileges and immunities clause and the Fourteenth Amendment alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.784" offset="1004607">And again, one does not have to consider precisely how far Congress is entitled to define or limit of the privileges or immunities of United States citizens because certainly again, it is subject in its legislation to the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.376" offset="1090915">Now, we find the constitutional recognition or reflection of this basic liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.087" offset="1125815">The constitutional condemnation -- underlying condemnation and discrimination between old -- discrimination between old and new residents in three or four familiar clauses of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.705" offset="1192270">The first is Article 4, Section 2, which guarantees the citizens of any state should be entitled to the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.574" offset="1243679">In Blake and McClung this Court pointed out, that the underlying phases of that clause was that a citizen of one state should not be in a condition of alienage when he is within or when he removed to another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.772" offset="1308463">I suggest the old notion of the Elizabethan Settlement laws was precisely that one is in the condition of alienage when it comes to the new community.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.023" offset="1349528">The Commerce Clause as interpreted in Crandall and Nevada and the Edward's case incorporates or reflects at least to some extent this fundamental notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.756" offset="1392473">Indeed, it is interesting to recall that while in the Edward's case, the Court -- the majority opinion, did not consider how far a state was under an obligation to a Court the same benefits to immigrants that it accorded to all their residents because that was in front of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.016" offset="1473452">It did point out that the philosophy of the Elizabethan Settlement laws is the majority of opinions that is no longer in accordance with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.198" offset="1514203">Third, we find this basic notion again, reflected in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.713" offset="1556313">There was considerable discussion when the 14th Amendment was under deliberation by the Congress about the right to move freely from place to place, freedom of locomotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.144" offset="1610021">I am not aware Justice Fortas although I haven't recently made a detailed search, I must confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.077" offset="1633740">I am not aware of any explicit mention of going from one state to another the discussion clearly did take place in terms of movement where you will and I should supposed that fairly interpreted that incorporated going from one state to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.136" offset="1705942">But I am not aware of any explicit mention of this before the Slaughter-House Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.703" offset="1732274">There, in the majority opinion, it is stated, it was referenced to the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that one of the rights is this, it “is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State” and in the sense of course, this is history because the opinion was written within the memory event who had been alive and taking part in affairs at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.005" offset="1901443">And finally, I recall that the Court -- that the guarantee of liberty in the Due Process Clause has been cited by such distinguished scholars as Zechariah Chafee or as a source of the right to move from state to state and as a limitation on the power of the Federal government to curtail that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.287" offset="1998618">Now in view of the fact that there is discrimination, not only is capricious in the sense that I argued yesterday, but operates to the disadvantage of those who are exercising a constitutional liberty, I suggest that a decision condemning that discrimination would be in accordance with settled constitutional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.634" offset="2111990">Unless of course, and I now come to the last point, unless it can be shown to bear a rational relationship to some state objective other than that set forth in the legislation, because its perfectly clear that this discrimination does not fulfill any of the objectives set forth in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.663" offset="2204045">In considering the various justifications that have been advanced, I would like to start by clearing the under branch, there are numbers that seemed to me, to one can dispose of very quickly, while there are others that perhaps requires somewhat further discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.936" offset="2281159">First, it is said that this one year is delay; this discrimination is an aid in budgeting for a subsequent year.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.970" offset="2325253">No one has suggested how this aid's budgeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.482" offset="2343330">And I must confess although, I maybe wrong because I have never made up a welfare budget, I can't see how it would aid budgeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.057" offset="2377603">No one has a census of the people who come in during a year, who may go on welfare which they can later use as a basis for knowing who will be added to the roads for next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.375" offset="2426922">Indeed it is my impression that no one has a census of the number of people who move in to a state in any particular year even in (Inaudible) at least not ordinarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.609" offset="2471852">But so that the figures that might make the projection somewhat easier simply aren't available.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.807" offset="2504662">Second, there are other elements that enter into the prediction of the sides of the welfare roads such as the value of employment and other things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.448" offset="2559206">It would overwhelm the significance of this relatively small figure of the number of people who have become bona fide residents who haven't been there a year and finally, I suggest that under Carrington and Rash and similar decisions of this Court, the slight administrative aid in convenience in budgeting even if it existed would not be adequate to justify discrimination as severe and hostile as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.656" offset="2704029">Second that is said, that this discrimination is justified because it will prevent people from presenting fraudulent claims to two or more states.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.504" offset="2759408">There's absolutely no showing of any likelihood of this kind of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.021" offset="2789501">The total errors checks indicate in the ADC payments for all kinds of eligibility run around 3% while a number of errors in fraud by making paid claims onto a state would be fantastically small and I may add that there other -- other checks and sources of money of course are made and this could be checked along with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.010" offset="2909456">A weight of deal, I think, to illustrate how farfetched this argument is, is to suppose that a state where to make it crime, I guess it is to seek welfare in two jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.004" offset="2969433">And in order to enact the subsection saying, whoever applies for aid within one year of moving into the state shall be presumed to be committing fraud by seeking payments from two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.316" offset="3030664">Even a prima facie rebuttable presumption of that kind without unquestionably be struck down as arbitrary and capricious the same way as in thought against the United States and other cases of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.125" offset="3089910">And finally on this point, I suggest to you that this is in principle squarely the kind of thing that Oyama forbids, that there that was created in arbitrary presumption that one was circumventing the California laws but with respect to who may hold agriculture premises and the Court said that California could not create an invidious discrimination against the American citizens of Japanese decent.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.558" offset="3215611">In order to deal with the few cases of fraud, that might otherwise be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.662" offset="3252078">Third, it is suggesting that this rule provides an objective test of residence over this in the District of Columbia brief and it was suggested by Judge Holtzoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.849" offset="3316861">I think at this point one has to be very careful about what he means when he says that the requirement of one year residence provides an objective test of residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.365" offset="3382899">Residence under the Social Security Laws means residence means presence in the state, living there, not for a temporary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.171" offset="3434099">In other words, without the intention of going somewhere else.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.352" offset="3978804">The part that I want to emphasize with respect to this test of residence is that one must ask what is it that you are trying to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.097" offset="4033766">I think that it lurks behind that expression and it seemed to me that this came out in Mr. Barton's argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.101" offset="4073785">The notion that we are really asking more permanency than being in the state voluntarily with no intention of living and if to the extent that something more lurks there but then our answer is simply that requiring to something more is itself an arbitrary and capricious classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.233" offset="4186321">To the extent that this is meant, the justification is alleged as being and just providing a test of who is a resident in the sense of which the HEW uses the term and the welfare laws use the term, that is voluntary presence with no intention to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.637" offset="4287990">Then we say, again this is -- it isn't a good test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.736" offset="4304394">It's utterly -- arbitrary and capricious to say that whoever has lived in the state must be presumed to have an intention of presently living in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.525" offset="4359565">We just know that isn't so and of course, there is no better proof that isn't so in many, many instances than these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.685" offset="4400212">Certainly little Shawn Brown, the baby, who haven't been born for more than a year ago had no greater intention to live the District of Columbia than his mother and the oldest member of the family, who qualified for the aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.185" offset="4478161">Certainly, Juanita Smith, the young woman who had -- who's family for generations had lived in Pennsylvania got away for a few years and then came back to rejoin her own family, which she'd promise to look out for can't, be said to have been likely to be planning to leave Pennsylvania just because she'd been away for a short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.026" offset="4585576">I mentioned in one other case, because it seems to me that not only bear out this point but illustrate some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.258" offset="4618491">The other plaintiff from the Pennsylvania case was Jose Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.303" offset="4638657">She had four children, had been on aid in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.919" offset="4657048">The reason she left to go to South Carolina was to take care of some old aged and sick parents, and as long as she, which incidentally involved to cut in any welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.002" offset="4717443">After they reached the point where she could no longer help them, she went back to Pennsylvania, were now to presume because she hadn't been back a year that she intended to live again is I submit to you, utterly absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.606" offset="4783794">Again, I think if this was stated in the form of a presumption, it should be presumed that any person who hasn't been a resident for a year intends to live or is a drifter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.561" offset="4839696">That one would say, of course, that is arbitrary and capricious and it's equally arbitrary and capricious when it's advanced as a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.213" offset="4878252">I would add two more points although, I think they're unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.205" offset="4902285">It must be remembered that we are dealing with the statute where there is an elaborate process of verification with respect to other conditions of eligibility involving not only elaborate questionnaires or visits to the home, surveillance in many jurisdictions, checking on references.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.860" offset="4996848">If that can be done with the respect to other conditions of eligibility but it certainly can be done with equal ease with respect to this better, of whether the signs of the person intends to live, and so again I suggest that the cases like Carrington and yet Rash and Oyama and California, Harman and Forssenius, all sustain our position that this won't do as a justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1330.566" offset="5427660">Well I don't how we measure the matter of contribution or investment in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.973" offset="5457335">I suggest that this is really a euphemistic way of expressing the same discrimination against strangers or outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.426" offset="5503101">I don't see how in the Brown family, anybody can say that one of the children and the mother had an investment in Washington or had made a contribution to the Washington and the others haven't.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.146" offset="6777981">Well, but I don't that I can argue that the Equal Protection Clause repeals the provision of the constitution, dealing with the qualifications of electives for the presidency and the constitution itself says, that those who should be qualified to vote for president, shall be those qualified to vote for the most numerous branch of the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.030" offset="6881531">And in terms of that consideration, as suggested in the colloquy with Justice Stewart, it does seem to me that there is an argument, I don't have to either espouse or reject it, but there is an argument not present here that goes to justify the rationality of the classification for that purpose and then the other clause about qualifications for president operates on it automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.108" offset="6993857">So that -- I think Your Honor's case, Mr. Chief Justice, would be a very analogous one if it weren't for perhaps, what today seems like an odd constitutional query and my answer, were it not for that quirk, I suspect would have to be very different although, I don't want to pin myself to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.707" offset="7148293">It is said in this group of (Inaudible) that the state might protect its financial possession that it may deter the poor from entering the state and that it may prevent the movement of indigents into the states for the purpose of securing welfare payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.413" offset="7231049">Again, I think one has to be exact about what it means to the extent that this is simply an argument that it would cost us traditional money to give welfare to residents for less than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.574" offset="7303670">But the answer is that the cause won't excuse a classification which otherwise violates the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.213" offset="7346301">A state could say that discrimination against black mothers and children would save us money, but nobody would think of advancing that as a justification for the invidious and hostile classification or discrimination on grounds of religion that might save money, probably save South Carolina a little bit of money in Sherbert and Verner.</text>

            <text syncTime="4380.193" offset="17626216">Yes, that's correct Justice White and I think you can make that but I also think that it is a support to our case to say that for this Court, first of all, this Court historically has said it will give greater deference to acts of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.887" offset="17708972">And secondly, I think that test as to discrimination rises higher in a Fifth Amendment situation than it does in a Fourteenth Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.672" offset="17764143">Finally, it just let me say that as we point out in the very last two pages of our brief that the logical result of what appellees asked this Court to do is to end all type of discrimination and all of type of welfare statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.263" offset="17838435">Remember, all of the statutes that we mentioned yesterday with regard to all types of welfare programs have residency requirements therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.133" offset="17877932">In addition, is this Court now prepared to establish that welfare really is a right and that in making a program to carry out the distribution of that right to citizens that there can be no discrimination at all that persons under 65 who are not blind or disabled, who do not belong in families with dependent children, but are frequently in dire need must -- the states now provide a welfare for them?</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.939" offset="18021188">What is the result of ending this type of discrimination and I suggest that the entire welfare program which has been adopted by the states and the federal congress does have discrimination included therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.951" offset="18077194">We don't give welfare except if you happen to meet the particular requirements, if you happen to be blind or disabled or over 65, but what about the people who are not?</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.950" offset="18133201">Is this Court now prepared to say that the welfare right must be extended to everyone without any discrimination whatsoever?</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.857" offset="18180848">I don't that the Court has ever gone that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.777" offset="18196522">I'm sure it hasn't and I suggest it will do so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.908" offset="18217002">And finally, I direct the Court's attention to Katzenbach versus the Morgan in which this Court upheld Section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act and struck down the New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.435" offset="18299131">But at the same time admitted that Section 4(e) which referred to American Flag Schools was in itself discriminatory, nevertheless, a valid exercise of legislative prerogative.</text>
