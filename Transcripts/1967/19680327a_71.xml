            <text syncTime="33.457" offset="237171">Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Honorable Justices of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.519" offset="273429">In this case here we have several violations, we believe, of the Constitution of the United States as they apply to this individual, Carafas.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.492" offset="313344">The facts are simply as follows, on June the 3rd, of 1959, a theft complaint was given to the detectives of Nassau County which is in Mineola, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.410" offset="373008">Someone had -- someone has stolen furniture from a development.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.970" offset="403205">It developed that a Cadillac and a trailer was seen in the vicinity of this area sometime earlier that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.280" offset="440508">And as a consequence of the situation, the detectives learned who the owner that automobile, a Cadillac automobile was and it was James Carafas.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.843" offset="494738">Thereafter, the detectives learned where he resided -- 35-53 36th Avenue, in New York -- in Queens, New York and they went to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.476" offset="561298">This is a premises which contains two-stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.691" offset="578121">The first storey was occupied by a physician and the second story was occupied by Mr. Carafas and his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.794" offset="618559">Upon arriving there, Detective Grame and Capler (ph) turned the knob of the door and entered the premises in the vestibule.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.575" offset="665684">Thereafter, they said they went into the doctor's office and they inquired where Carafas lived and someone said, "upstairs", and Detective Grame and Capler (ph) then mounted the stairway.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.114" offset="731826">As they mounted the stairway, they said they noticed some furniture which was on the landing which was of the type described to them by the owner of the Development.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.234" offset="796296">And upon reaching the top of the stairway, they said they put one James Carafas under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.940" offset="835166">The version of the defendant or the petitioner in this instance is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.989" offset="863378">His version is that he was lying on a divan in his living room, and that these two detectives walked into his living room, awakened him and then start to run -- rushed at into his premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.854" offset="922833">So much so that quite a commotion was caused and other police had to be called from the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.623" offset="953866">Both husband and wife were put under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.496" offset="973406">Now the issues involved in this particular case are as follows: whether or not the evidence that was procured at this time should have been suppressed under the Mapp rule, which this Court decided on June the 19th, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.490" offset="1053341">And whether or not the violations of the Constitution also occurred as to the individual rights as to whether or not he had to be questioned without an attorney or whether he had to be given his constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.783" offset="1126484">Now, we contend --</text>

Foley of the Northern District of the State of New York.</text>
