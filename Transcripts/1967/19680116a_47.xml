            <label>Mr. Emanuel Redfield</label>
            <text syncTime="15.242" offset="164342">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.596" offset="181791">This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court of the State of New York which affirmed a conviction of the appellant for having violated Section 484-h of the Penal Law of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.026" offset="279489">Since the Highest Court of the State of New York, the Court of Appeals did not take this case for review, the Appellate Term as the Court in which -- it was a final court in which a judgment could be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.975" offset="355244">And this judgment raises several important and noble questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.151" offset="395995">And the first one is, was there on its face and in its operation, is Section 484-h of the Penal Law repugnant to the constitution, the amendment -- First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment because it acts as a restraint upon expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.544" offset="509576">The second question is, is the statute vague and overbroad by its terms and its standards if it has meaningful standards?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.641" offset="557955">And third, is this publication or before publications involved within the scope of the statute in other words, was the Act validly applied to this particular plaint -- appellant.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.311" offset="732662">Was in the scope but as applied, as the statute has been applied and construed with respect to this particular publication can you condemn this appellant.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="168.687" stopTime="177.522">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="168.687" offset="778115">Well, does the constitution permits you to do what the state did with respect to that publication regardless of what the statute says, that's our question as to --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="emanuel_redfield" startTime="177.522" stopTime="504.992">
            <label>Mr. Emanuel Redfield</label>
            <text syncTime="177.522" offset="813432">Yes, that's in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.046" offset="831509">I should say at the outset Your Honors that if this weren't a criminal conviction and I had a choice in the matter I would have not -- confining the issue solely to the first question because I think the issue was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.358" offset="908831">And not only is it right but I think it is imperative that a decision be reached on that point even if the appellant can be victorious on any of the other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.258" offset="960449">I think Your Honors, should at this time undertake the task of putting – address this question which has caused so many uncertainties and so much debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.875" offset="1018859">And the question comes down to this, whether the power of the state maybe exercised to punish a person who sells certain publications enumerated in the statute to persons based on the age of the reader or the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.385" offset="1136933">And I say too that the basic question -- that basic question falls unto two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.958" offset="1179251">The first, as a matter of principle, is it repugnant to the constitution and secondly, that by its operation in effect as a pragmatic question, does it intimidate the vendor and publisher of books to the point where it become censorship?</text>
            <text syncTime="295.594" offset="1285726">In other words, the second question to be clear is similar to the question that was raised and decided in Smith against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.473" offset="1325223">Smith against California you recall was a purely practical decision because the Court found that under the circumstances of the operation of the statute intimidation resulted was its consequent censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.677" offset="1410069">Now, the court below and -- meaning the Appellate Term in writing for affirmance wrote nothing and the Court of Appeals also stated nothing but I suspect from the argument that went on that it's determination came about because of the case of the Bookcase against Broderick which was decided about a year ago in the Court of Appeals of the State of New York in which I brought to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.344" offset="1564714">The Bookcase decision rested on a dictum in the Jacobellis case and also rested on the dissenting language in People against Bookcase in which case, a prior law had been rendered unconstitutional by the Highest Court of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.628" offset="1665860">So at this point, I cannot give you the ultimate construction of the statute as rendered in this case but can only refer you to what was said in Bookcase against Broderick.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.049" offset="1751542">My appellant who received the suspended sentence is not a flamboyant vendor nor a self-seeking or say like charging along in the rights of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.254" offset="1832417">He is just the poor, simple, humble owner of a candy store or stationary store or a newspaper (Inaudible) that sort of a place that is so common throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.563" offset="1901589">He has this little store which of size 70 by -- seven by 30 feet in the little village of Bellmore, Long Island, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.248" offset="1948400">And he works from morning to late at night with his wife to eat out in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.329" offset="1984658">And it's so much though, that he had to shut the store for about three days during the pendency of the trial under this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.700" offset="2026141">And as I said, he sells almost everything that that type of a store sells and as part of it, he carries about 200 titles of magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.166" offset="2087999">He has no choice in these titles, they are sent to him automatically by the jobbers.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.550" offset="2269602">Now, the charge against him was on October 18th, 1965 he sold two magazines, one called Mr. Annual and the other is Sarah this thing and if Your Honors recall just a few months ago as I can recall, you had this particular title before you in the case of Gent versus Arkansas which I argued here.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.979" offset="2459251">And now they call it “Girly” and then there was another charge against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.435" offset="2493106">Then on October 26, 1965, he sold magazine called “Man to Man” an escapade to a similar type of magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.616" offset="2561860">And it should be observed, why -- of course he sold them to this boy of 16 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.214" offset="2596237">It should be observed that the charge here is only that these pictures contain nudes and I should -- that the magazines contained pictures that were nudes and that these were harmful to minors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.050" offset="4135581">In other words, if it were given away, the person couldn't be guilty of the crime but if he got money for it, it made a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.547" offset="4181556">And the reason I emphasize this is so that you could see that there is something wrong with the statute right off because if the purpose of the statute is to restrict the promiscuous circulation of this type of magazine to those under 17 they certainly haven't attained that even in the text because it can be distributed to those who will not pay a monetary consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.078" offset="4527731">And also point out the fact that several of the amicus in this case as well as the Columbia law review had found some solace in the recent Gold case in which children's right to read should be considered and protected because children wished to be free of the orthodoxy of adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.535" offset="4637550">But -- and this relates too to the observation made earlier today that children do not have freedom of speech as much as adult.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.474" offset="7989269">484-h, a violation of which was punishable as a misdemeanor is a children's obscenity law validly based on the variable obscenity concept approved by this Court in Mishkin against New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.301" offset="8128554">I submit that the Court of Appeals characterization is correct since the statute's definition of harmful to minors includes the elements of this Court's definition of obscenity that is predominant, appeal to prurient interest, patent, offensiveness and absence of social importance with slight adjustments of wording necessary to relate and confined its prohibiting reach to children.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.805" offset="9250565">In the Mishkin and Ginzburg cases, I think that very frankly that the Court has noticed the prurient interest of these so-called girly magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.743" offset="9306363">And in Mishkin, no psychiatric testimony or the light was presented to show that the material in question appealed to the prurient interest of pseudo masochist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.135" offset="9351920">However, 484-h could've exercised its regulatory effect constitutionally even if it were not an obscenity law and thus the question of whether the state's proof in this case satisfy the obscenity criteria of 484-h is not a federal question eligible for decision by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.193" offset="9444185">Since the people's proof shows beyond a reasonable doubt sailed with the requisite scienter of nude photo magazine, nude photo magazines to a 16-year-old boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.966" offset="9499251">It has proved all that need to be proved to justify criminal punishment on constitutional grounds where the attribute of sovereignty on which the prosecution and statute is founded is the state's power as parens patriae for the benefit of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.528" offset="9573439">Since 484-h is an obscenity law, I don't believe the appellant can raise the First Amendment objections through it since under this Court's holding in the Roth against the United States case, obscenity is not protected -- is not protected expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.217" offset="9664240">The scienter provision knowingly is not invalid on its face because it will not restrict by indirect effect the flow of protected material to adults within the rationale of Smith against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.023" offset="9739473">This is so because most adults are patently over the age limit set out in 484-h under 17 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.584" offset="9781687">Thus dealers will not withhold sale to adults and will not fail to make a sale where the adult is a customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.994" offset="9831320">Moreover, the law provides for the defensive honest mistake as to age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.437" offset="9857128">It follows that the deal who has made inquiry as to age and receive reassurance will rot -- will rely on the honest mistake provision and will not hesitate to sell to an adult at all even if the dealer has not examined the working question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.299" offset="9936541">In the few situations where age is in doubt, the buyer to whom allegedly the dealer might be hesitant to sell in the absence of an honest mistake provision as to age will usually not be an adult but instead will be a youngster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.537" offset="10001533">Indeed, most youngsters in this marginal age group are so young that they have been included in 4 -- that they could've have been included in 484-h's prohibition without giving constitutional offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.331" offset="10072691">Thus, indirect restriction on distribution to them does not raise federal questions since they could be denied access by direct prohibition, it's constitutionally indifferent whether the state has instead contrived this accepts -- acceptable denial of access by indirect means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.076" offset="10167672">There is nothing constitutionally objectionable in placing the burden of judgment on the book dealer and to require him to determine if the material sold by him comes within the prohibited class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.910" offset="10218977">In Mishkin, this Court approved the New York statute namely Section 118 -- 44 of Penal Law the old Section 1141, excuse me, which it viewed as placing the same burden of judgment on book dealers as on publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.719" offset="10290239">Appellants claimed in this regard a vagueness argument in disguise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.086" offset="10311764">But this Court in effect has held that the definitions of obscenity in Roth against United States, Manual Enterprises against Day, Jacobellis against Ohio and the Mishkin, Ginzburg and Fanny Hill cases are adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.053" offset="10375607">It follows that the definitions in 484-h give sufficiently definite noticed of what materials are within its prohibition and do not place an excessive burden on the deal.</text>
