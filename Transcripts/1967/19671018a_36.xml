            <text syncTime="17.059" offset="171656">Yesterday afternoon the discussion centered on the jurisdictional issue relating to the powers of the Courts of Appeals to issue writs of mandamus at the behest of the government in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.853" offset="226826">And unless there are further questions on that phase of the case, I'd like to turn my attention to the issue on the merits, and that is the propriety of Judge Will's ruling in this case that the government must turn over to the defense, a list of the names and addresses of all individuals to whom the defendant had made statements relating to the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.530" offset="345527">Did I understand you to say that the indictment in this case has been dismissed by the Judge [Inaudible] there would have been no appeal by the government?</text>

            <text syncTime="80.648" offset="425984">Petitioner's counsel mentioned the Apex case, which does -- a Ninth Circuit case I believe, which holds that the only, the government may only appeal the dismissal of an indictment when the reason for the dismissal has to do with the validity of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.797" offset="498604">While the issue has not been authoritatively resolved by, has not been addressed by this Court, I think the government at least tacitly accepts the Apex principle and would not attempt to appeal a dismissal for failure to comply with the judge's order.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.572" offset="705703">Now, to us the essential point as to the propriety of the Judge Will's ruling is that the Federal Criminal Rule simply do not contain any authority for this kind of disclosure of the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.847" offset="770800">Now, two years ago when the federal rules were extensively revised in this area of discovery, it was urged upon the revisers that many of the principles of civil discovery be carried into the criminal sphere, and specifically that a list of witnesses that the government intended to call be furnished to the defense in advance of trial and the revisers declined to make that change and you will find --</text>

            <text syncTime="218.824" offset="978631">excluding instances where the judge had some affirmative reason for not turning over particular names that is to say the proposal was not in terms of granting or denying the judge's discretion, am I -- is my recollection correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="239.404" offset="1060968">I think I believe that's how it read, but I think that Judge Will has adopted a policy of routinely making this information available to the defense rather than requiring any showing of particular need on the part of the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.100" offset="1263783">We contend that the order is erroneous insofar as it does reflect a practice of routinely making -- ordering these disclosures without regard to the circumstances of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.220" offset="1324283">Had Judge Will found something special in the facts here, had the defense argued that there was something special in the facts here, which required disclosure of this information that would be a different case.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.808" offset="1434624">I must say to you, as I indicated yesterday, that I have the greatest difficulty in considering statements to the effect that judge ought to be -- we ought to use mandamus really to discipline a Judge with respect to a general practice, the details and the circumstances of which we don't have before us in the sense that they're not in this record and I think it's a very serious thing, it's a very drastic thing that you're asking us to do in the absence of what I would regard as adequate information?</text>

            <text syncTime="379.492" offset="1621347">Well, without reopening that issue completely, I note that in the La Buy case in 352 United States, a major statement of this Court as to the function of mandamus, the Court in noting that mandamus should be resorted to only in extreme cases went on to say, and I'm quoting the Supreme Court, “There is an end of patience and it clearly appears that the Court of Appeals has for years admonished the trial judges of the Seventh Circuit that the practice of making references does not commend itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.981" offset="1767320">And the court goes on to point out that in 1942 and subsequent occasions the court had rebuked, Court of Appeals had rebuked the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.611" offset="1809847">It emphasizes the fact that the particular judge involved in that case had referred 11 cases to masters in the past six years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.482" offset="6977285">This Court in at least two cases has indicated that the bill of particulars was a method by which potential witnesses could be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.512" offset="7017409">As a matter of fact in the Roviaro case, this Court said that the name of the informant could be obtained by the use of the bill of particulars and if the government didn't want to furnish it, the recourse of the court would be to dismiss the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.941" offset="7615091">That is a possibility Mr. Chief Justice, but we suggest that even in the framework of the record as it stands now, the nature of the particular offense charged that is that this is not a charge of income tax evasion, this is a charge of willfully making a false return under the penalties of perjury, not believing the contents of that return to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.298" offset="7708609">It's in the nature of a written perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.896" offset="7718954">The government is frank to admit now that here are admissions by the defendant concerning this willfulness reflecting upon the proposition of whether in fact he had perjured himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.805" offset="7934621">This Court must rule within the framework of these facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.915" offset="7954996">This is precisely what the Court took some pains to do in La Buy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.073" offset="7971715">In La Buy, this Court went in precise details about the exceptional circumstances in the case that came before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.087" offset="8007764">We suggest in the ultimate, if it please the Court, that if the government is permitted to use the extraordinary writ in the situation that the floodgates would open, that the entire trial of cases and criminal cases would be open to speculation, the defendants would be hard-put to proceed, that the government would have it within its power whether the grant of -- to answer a bill of particulars or not.</text>
