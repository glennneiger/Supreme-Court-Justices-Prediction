            <text syncTime="23.950" offset="199137">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.200" offset="216168">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reviewing judgment -- the decision of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.062" offset="267577">The issue presented before the Court today is may a property which was seized from the petitioner's automobile during a general administrative search at a time subsequent to petitioner's arrest after his automobile had been impounded by the police and towed where police -- precinct lot some four or five miles from the place of arrest while the petitioner was in custody and under lawful arrest at the police station be received in evidence against the petitioner consistent with the Fourth Amendment with the search of the automobile and the seizure of the property as performed without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.677" offset="466108">The regulation promulgated by the Metropolitan Police Department in this case is cited on page 3 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.434" offset="513128">During the late evening hours of August 29th, 1964 at approximately 11:45 PM that evening, a York robbery occurred in the 5500 Block of 13th Street, Northwest Washington DC.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.060" offset="583659">Among one of the articles taken from the victim that evening was a registration card to his automobile bearing his name and identification of that automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.727" offset="642278">An off-duty police officer at approximately at the time of the robbery observed three colored males running North on 13th Street and enter a Ford automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.476" offset="701315">The officer wrote down a description of the automobile and the tag number.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.492" offset="725347">He phoned this description in to the sixth precinct approximately five to 10 minutes after he observed the three males running North on 13th Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.127" offset="767875">The next day another police officer was assigned to investigate this robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.966" offset="795251">And at that time was given a description of the automobile and the tag number.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.025" offset="823463">The police officer at that time checked with the Motor Vehicle Department of the District of Columbia and ascertain that the petitioner in this case was the owner of that automobile and also that the car was registered to a premises in the vicinity of the 2500 Block of M Street, Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.201" offset="900159">The police officer preceded to the area the 2500 Block of M Street Northwest, at which time, he saw the petitioner in this case attempt to enter his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.755" offset="962435">The officer testified that the petitioner had opened the door to his car when he approached him, asked him his name, placed him under arrest for robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.886" offset="1014888">The petitioner was placed in a police cruiser at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.010" offset="1035368">The arresting officer conducted a cursory search of the automobile to see whether or not there were any weapons in the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.892" offset="1066924">He found none.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.724" offset="1078314">He then called for a police crane to come and tow the vehicle to the sixth precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.556" offset="1105586">The car was left on the M street --at 1M Street unlocked and unattended to await the arrival of the police crane.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.825" offset="1150621">The arresting officer and his partner transported the petitioner via a police cruiser to the sixth precinct which was a ride of 10 to 20 minutes and was approximately six or seven miles from the place of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.145" offset="1215927">The time of arrest without any warrant was estimated to be at 1:30 PM in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.442" offset="1245184">At approximately 3:00 PM the same day, the operator of the crane arrived at the sixth precinct and informed the arresting officer that the car was on the lot inside of the precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.249" offset="1304325">He notified the officer that there was a light rain falling, and that he did not roll up the windows because he did not want to disturb any finger prints which may have been found on the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.932" offset="1355107">Officer Baker who was the arresting officer went out to the automobile to make an inventory search pursuant to the police regulation which is cited again on page 3 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.801" offset="1414562">Officer Baker first went and put a property tag on the steering wheel.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.942" offset="1439117">He then proceeded into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.133" offset="1447894">He searched the glove compartment, the rear of the car and he also testified that he looked behind the sun visor.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.574" offset="1481644">He found nothing to remove from the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.913" offset="1495019">He got out of the car, walked around to the passenger side.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.825" offset="1514663">He opened up the right front door to roll up the window to protect it from the rain.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.649" offset="1541935">At this point, lying on the door well with the automobile was a registration card belonging to the victim of the robbery that occurred the night before.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.178" offset="1620093">It was the right door well on the right front door.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.897" offset="1639006">After the officer discovered the registration card, he left the door opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.232" offset="1664293">He left the registration card lying in the well.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.472" offset="1677249">He went into the precinct and brought the petitioner back and confronted him with the evidence which he found.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.670" offset="1710059">He then took the evidence, turned it over to the police property clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.994" offset="1727300">The next day he went down to the Court and obtained a search warrant directed to the police property clerk to seize the registration card which he had found the day before.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.857" offset="1782784">Officer Baker testified that the sole purpose of the search was to find and protect property which may have been in the car pursuant to the police regulation which was in effect at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.600" offset="1837746">On a motion to suppress this evidence, it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.486" offset="1853315">However the District Court found that the police officer had more than one thing in mind when he went out to look at this car.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.624" offset="1897827">At page 118 of the record, the district judge stated that not only did he go out to protect the automobile from the elements or to remove property, but in fact he did conduct a search of that automobile for that he eventually opened up the trunk of the car which was locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.368" offset="2016841">The Fourth Amendment to the constitution has laid down procedures to be followed where police officers want to search areas protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.337" offset="2072743">Most recently, this doctrine was reaffirmed in Katz versus the United States in which the Court said that searches conducted outside the judicial process without prior approval by judge of magistrate are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, subject only to a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.470" offset="2177233">Well, if a -- would you be making the same argument if the police property clerk could have the duty of examining automobiles that have been impounded legally and had gone and searched the car in a routine search or to pick up -- to inventory personal property and to put it in the lock box or in a check room or something and had discovered the same statement and had to call somebody's attention to him.</text>
