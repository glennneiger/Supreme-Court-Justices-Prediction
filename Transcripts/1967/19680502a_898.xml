            <label>Mr. Murray H. Bring</label>
            <text syncTime="48.964" offset="299238">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.189" offset="324106">This case involves an important question of statutory interpretation with respect to a constitutionally inspired federal statue that governs the conduct of federal officers when they made or are required to break in to a private dwelling in order to affect another wise lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.692" offset="406131">Also involved in the case is a question whether consistent with the Fourth Amendment federal officers may force their way into a private dwelling at night in order to make an arrest with other warrant under circumstances which did not excuse their failure to obtain the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.303" offset="484603">The facts of the case are not complicated and maybe briefly summarized as follows; on Saturday evening February 19th, 1966, a man by the name of Edward Jones was entering the United States from Mexico at the San Ysidro, California port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.932" offset="559104">He was stopped by custom officials and was searched, whereupon the customs officials discovered a container of cocaine concealed in his undershorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.636" offset="601945">They immediately arrested him for violations of the narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.179" offset="624097">And thereupon, they began a process of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.151" offset="639979">Initially, Mr. Jones denied that he was involved in this elicit transaction with anyone else but after about three or four hours of interrogation, he admitted to the customs officers that he had actually been taken to Mexico on the preceding day by a person named Johnny, that Johnny had hired him to pick up the narcotics and bring them back to Los Angeles for delivery to Johnny and that Johnny had promised to pay him $100 if he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.036" offset="759515">At that point, the customs officials transported Jones from San Diego to Los Angeles and at approximately at 3 o?clock in the morning, Jones in the presence of the customs officers try to telephone a number in Los Angeles which was written on a card that the police officers found in Jones?s possession when he was arrested, also on a card was the named Johnny.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.070" offset="859617">No one answered that telephone call and three or four other attempts were made to call that number during the early morning hours of Sunday, February 20th and again no answer was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.671" offset="910085">The officers then for some reason which is undisclosed by the record transported Jones back to San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.699" offset="942164">At 3:00 PM on the following afternoon, the officers again invited Jones to try and call the number in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.106" offset="975809">On this occasion, the call was answered by a male voice on the other side of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.726" offset="1002245">Jones identified himself as BJ and addressed the person on the other side of the telephone as Johnny.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.855" offset="1038817">He indicated that he was still in San Diego and that he still had the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.392" offset="1060968">Johnny then inquired whether Jones had any trouble in crossing the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.938" offset="1079150">Jones indicated that he had not and Johnny said that he had been arrested when he had been down in Mexico and that was the reason he was curious as to whether or not Jones had had any trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.083" offset="1119692">Jones inquired whether Johnny was going to be in hes apartment and when Johnny said he would, Jones said well I'll come up to Los Angeles to your apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.040" offset="1151561">At that point, the agents did not attempt to verify any further any of the information which had been given to them by Jones who dwell all intents and purposes was an unreliable informant nor did they go to a magistrate in an effort to try to obtain a warrant for Johnny's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.187" offset="1228152">Rather they transported Jones to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.960" offset="1243199">They went to the location where Johnny's apartment was.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.449" offset="1261171">They outfitted Jones with an electronic transmitting device and they returned the container of cocaine to Jones and sent him to Johnny?s apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.048" offset="1303594">At this time the officers of which there were four or five in number took up positions near the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.770" offset="1326477">And they attempted to overhear the conversation that took place between Jones and people inside of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.497" offset="1361377">Jones went to the apartment, knocked on the door and the door was answered by a woman who was visiting Johnny at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.118" offset="1391888">Jones asked if Johnny was in and the lady said that he was and that she would get him.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.551" offset="1413622">Jones then went into the apartment and the lady closed the door to the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.333" offset="1432743">Now, this much of the conversation was overheard by the officers who were listening to the electronic transmitting device.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.471" offset="1465240">When Jones went into the apartment, the lady who was there called Johnny who turned out to be petitioner, from the bedroom and he came in to the living room and met with Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.712" offset="1514245">The conversation that followed was not overheard by the police officers because there was music being played in the background and this drowned out their ability to hear the conversation over the electronic transmitting device.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.230" offset="1568266">Apparently, the officers in Los Angeles did not have available to them some of the more sophisticated means of bugging that this Court has just heard about and they therefore were frustrated in their efforts to hear what went on in the apartment and to make the recording of that conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.252" offset="1632423">One of the officers did testify that he heard one of the people in the apartment mentioned the word ?package? though he could not identify which of the two people mentioned that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.121" offset="1675891">And the other person made a response, though he also could not identify or make out what the response was.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.690" offset="1702118">At this point after Jones had been in the apartment for approximately five to ten minutes, the officers decided that because they could not make a recording of the conversation that was going on within the apartment that they should then proceed into the apartment to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.475" offset="1769305">Three or four officers approached the door of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.685" offset="1782157">The officer in charge of the group knocked on the door, waited a few seconds, when there was no reply, he turned the knob of the door, the door being unlocked he opened it and rushed into the apartment with his gun drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.685" offset="1830118">He was immediately followed by two or three other officers at least one of who, also had his gun drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.307" offset="1856554">There was no announcement by the police at least the record discloses that their was no announcement by the police that any of the officers announced who they were, what their purpose was or what their authority was before entering the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.452" offset="1913187">Once inside of the apartment, the officers observed petitioners sitting on the couch, dressed only in his underclothes and Jones sitting on a chair next to the couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.526" offset="1957491">As they entered one of the officers indicated that he saw a petitioner withdraw his hand from underneath the cushion of the couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.526" offset="1989465">They immediately announced that both petitioner and Jones were under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.067" offset="2007646">They took petitioner from the couch, placed him against the wall, put him in handcuffs, searched him, searched Jones and then undertook a general and comprehensive search of the entire apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.085" offset="2055711">In the course of that search, they found the container of narcotics and under the cushion of the couch near where the petitioner had been sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.849" offset="2090820">They also found in other rooms of the apartment certain evidence which was not introduced at petitioners trial but which was testified about specifically some squares, aluminum squares and some balloons which the police officer indicated were customarily used in the elicit trade of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.457" offset="2177233">The officers then placed both petitioner and Jones under arrest and took them from the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.469" offset="2209207">Mr. Jones did not have on his person the $100.00 which he claimed petitioner had promised to give him if he had delivered the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.890" offset="2246928">At the trial, when the government attempted to introduce the container of narcotics, the petitioners counsel objected in a rather general fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.854" offset="2302830">He indicated that principally the police did not have probable cause to enter the apartment when they did to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.995" offset="2331355">He also objected to the fact that the police entered the apartment without a warrant and his discussion or his general lodging of the objection also contained a reference to the fact that the police broke into the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.875" offset="2382869">The District Court denied the objection, had admitted the narcotics into evidence and an appeal from his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.853" offset="2414738">The conviction was affirmed, the Court of Appeals sustaining the District Court's admission of the narcotics into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.983" offset="2447339">Now, the petitioner today principally contends that the arrest of the petitioner was unlawful and that the search which was conducted subsequent to that arrest was also unlawful thereby requiring that the narcotics should have been excluded from the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.744" offset="2518392">The basic reason for the illegality of the arrest is the fact that the officers when they broke in to petitioner's apartment did not comply with the requirements of 18 USC Section 3109 which indicates that an officer may break in to an apartment to effect an arrest but only if he first announces his authority and his purpose for breaking in.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="628.763" offset="2618389">Mr. Bring, Section 3109 by its terms applies only to what an officer may do to execute a search warrant and here this was an arrest without a warrant just for two reasons, 180 degrees different from what the statute seems to be addressed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.104" offset="2699786">But I gathered from reading the briefs that both counsel agreed that this is the applicable statue, am I right about it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="murray_h_bring" startTime="655.839" stopTime="661.466">
            <label>Mr. Murray H. Bring</label>
            <text syncTime="655.839" offset="2726745">Mr. Justice Stewart that is correct by its term the statue would not seem to contemplate an arrest without a warrant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="661.466" stopTime="661.848">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="661.466" offset="2749210">Right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray H. Bring</label>
            <text syncTime="661.848" offset="2750777">On the other hand, that specific question was raised in United States against Miller where the government conceded that the statute does apply to any arrest without a warrant and the Court specifically held that it does apply to that kind of arrest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="672.524" stopTime="674.238">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="672.524" offset="2793514">Yeah, right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="murray_h_bring" startTime="674.238" stopTime="778.322">
            <label>Mr. Murray H. Bring</label>
            <text syncTime="674.238" offset="2800306">So that you might say that the statue has been extended beyond the specific language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.256" offset="2832384">Now the government and the Court of Appeals below, both take the position that the statute does not apply in this case because there was not a breaking open of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.732" offset="2886301">And the theory upon which their argument rests is best summarized at page 6 of the government's brief where it takes the position that in common understanding, break open connotes the forcible destruction of a locked door.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.682" offset="2950144">In other words, it is the government's position and it was not the position of the Court below that the word break open means only the use of force to gain access to a private dwelling and that unless force is used, the announcement requirement of Section 3109 is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.696" offset="3030183">Your Honors, we take the position that this is a hyper-technical and detached overly-strained interpretation of the words break open and it's not consistent at all with the basic objectives which the announcement requirement of Section 3109 were intended to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.988" offset="3107297">Mr. or Judge learned hand has indicated in one of his famous decisions that the art of interpretation is the art of proliferating a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.810" offset="3146585">And we think that if one analyzes what the purpose of Section 3109 is, what the purpose of the announcement requirement is, it makes no sense whatsoever as the government suggests to draw a distinction between forcibly breaking into an apartment and walking through a closed but unlocked door.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.213" offset="3256195">The Ninth Circuit itself has so held that if a police officer gains access by using a passkey to open the door that somehow that is brought within the purview of Section 3109 even though the government admits there's no force involved there.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.187" offset="3344071">There it seems to me to be no difference if forces to be at all relevant in the application of the statutes, whether the door knob is turned by the force of the energy of the hand turning the knob or whether it passkey is use.</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray H. Bring</label>
            <text syncTime="835.017" offset="3443440">I would make the same argument to this extent that the objectives of the statue are designed to ensure the privacy of the occupant of the home and to prevent violence which frequently accompanies unannounced intrusions into the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.878" offset="3498924">And also to ensure the presumption of innocence that every citizen enjoys.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.872" offset="3514911">Now, one of the door is open or closed or partially secured by arrested chain or whatever the situation maybe, those objectives it seems to me have to be served in every case unless there are some indication that the person in the apartment has voluntarily relinquished his privacy or has invited the police to come into the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.465" offset="3601220">Now, I think as is the case in most search and seizure cases, you have to look at the facts in every situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.475" offset="3629223">But I can easily conceive of the case in which the door would be open in which the statutory requirement should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.585" offset="3657749">For example, a person may have come into his apartment and shut the door closed thinking that he closed it but in fact the latch didn?t catch and a gust of wind may have come along and opened the door again.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.265" offset="3704456">The person then goes into another room of the apartment maybe watching television, maybe eating dinner, the police come, they see the door open and they walked into the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.038" offset="3739564">Now, as far as the person inside the apartment is concerned, he doesn't know who those people are, he doesn't know why they're there.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.382" offset="3800900">And they may elicit the same violent response that any unannounced intrusion into the home may elicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.335" offset="3824724">So there, the situation in my opinion where the fact that the door open does not eliminate the necessity from making the announcement require -- the necessity from making the announcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.372" offset="5420910">And it's understandable that that analogy is drawn because in each case, the societal interest involved are the same namely to preserve the right of privacy of the occupant and to minimize the chances of violence which are attended upon unannounced intrusions into the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.413" offset="5493008">Interestingly, only within the last two months, the Supreme Court of California has rendered a decision which is squarely on point with this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.686" offset="8586115">First, we contend that nothing in either the constitution, the case is decided by this Court where the relevant statute requires an agent who's affecting an arrest to announce his purpose before opening an unlocked door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.331" offset="8648704">Second, we contend that even in this record, there are sufficient facts to show that the agents would be justified in not announcing their purpose before entering the apartment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.034" offset="8707532">First I think I'd like to address myself to the statute if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.989" offset="8727280">I think both parties before the Court have conceded that in general, the principles enunciated in the statute governed the decision before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.644" offset="8769912">I think this was recognized in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.096" offset="8783705">I think it might occur where we accept the fact that the constitution, the requirement of announcement has constitutional overtones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.106" offset="8827800">However, I don't think having said that, that we can necessarily accept the fact that this statute totally controls the question of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.004" offset="8867401">Obviously, the statue was not drafted with the problems of arrest in mind and in response to Mr. Justice Fortas question about the statue and it does not say anything about an exception for agents who might be endangered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.496" offset="8925393">Their own lives might be in danger in affecting the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.140" offset="8935946">It does refer to people who might be inside when the search is being conducted and might be in danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.212" offset="8956217">I think the reason for this is clear that the Congress was not concerned, was not addressing itself to a search situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.323" offset="8984639">So that I don't think that we can say the statute completely controls the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.956" offset="9011179">I do think that in so far as it talks about the need to announce the purpose before breaking in, it embodies a concept which certainly in so far as the federal Courts are concerned this Court decision in Miller makes clear is a governing standard and as I say has constitutional overtones.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.880" offset="9162898">One, I think the question is Mr. Bring has argued in his brief that the Fourth Amendment protects privacy not property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.863" offset="9202813">Certainly, that's conceded by the government in all situation, we are talking about the right of the government to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.221" offset="9236250">The Fourth Amendment said some of the requirements when they can enter and when they can breach a person's privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.657" offset="9270000">When a private premises can be invaded by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.646" offset="9281912">So in so far as it requires a warrant or arrest pursuant to probable cause to justify the intrusion, that's clearly concerned more with privacy than property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.338" offset="9316707">I think the historical development of the announcement rule as is set forth in our brief indicates that that part of the law of search and seizure is more closely related to the question of property than privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.932" offset="9383058">But certainly it does have some function with regard to privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2792.558" offset="11273592">The burglar has absolutely no right to enter an apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.993" offset="11291355">By the terms of most burglary statutes, it only applies when he is not only entering, but entering for some unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.196" offset="11320195">So the society has every right to prevent the entrance of the burglar, and has every right to apply its laws very rigorously to prevent his entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.796" offset="11406608">He cannot be excluded, so that the context is so entirely different that I don't think that there is any reason to construe the use of the word as the same in both situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.122" offset="11467839">I think -- well, it might be argued in the state case that a state policeman dealing with the question of burglary on a day to day basis should understand breaking as a -- as it's understood in the burglary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.593" offset="11525726">We are here, dealing with the statute directed, to provide directions for federal officers who don't handle common law crimes such as burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.622" offset="11557909">There's no reason to suspect that those agents will have in mind the concept of breaking as it's used in a burglary statute when they read the statute, and try and conform their conduct to the standards which it prescribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.421" offset="11637008">I think that they would understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.755" offset="11650382">The agents who made this arrest would have understood the statute as to not require an announcement, because I don't think they considered that they were breaking into this apartment when they opened, entered through the unlocked door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.282" offset="11708479">However, even if this Court were to reject our contention in this regard, and hold that an announcement is required before opening an unlocked door, I think there are circumstances here which would have justified the officers in breaking into this apartment without announcing their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.624" offset="11825821">Now, here again, I must state that because this was not developed -- this contention was not developed in the trial Court -- the record is only scanty on this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.422" offset="11925086">There are two such passages contained in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.967" offset="11963225">First, there is I think the entire posture of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.220" offset="11980257">At the time the agents entered, they knew that the informant was inside.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.441" offset="12017142">I don't think it would be unreasonable for the agents in no circumstances, to realize that if they knocked, and announced that they were there to arrest, that the petitioner might have immediately expected that the agents upcoming so closely on Jones's heels, it was obvious that Jones was working with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.349" offset="12104808">And if petitioner had come to that conclusion, then the agents could have expected that he might, if he was armed, take some effort either to injure Jones, or to use Jones as a hostage, in an attempt to resist arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.667" offset="12166040">I think also when you're dealing with a crime such as a narcotics violation which carries such heavy penalties --</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.964" offset="12339179">I think that it's also possible, as I say that when you're dealing with something like a narcotics statute, which has mandatory five-year penalty, and penalties running up to 20 years, it's not unreasonable for the agents to assume that if they announced their purpose, the party within may take some action to resist arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.020" offset="13199444">He testified that when he went in to the apartment, he immediately went over, he noticed Jones sitting on the couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.946" offset="13235179">So Jones, with his hand under the cushion, immediately went over, and removed -- I'm sorry, not Jones, the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.866" offset="13262869">So the petitioner was sitting on the couch with his hand under the under cushion, he went over, and immediately removed the petitioner from the area of the couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.723" offset="13290245">He was asked why he did this, and his answer was, it appears on page 46, I didn't know particularly what was underneath the cushion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.485" offset="13329324">My feeling was that possibly, it could have been a weapon of some type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.020" offset="13347401">So, it's obvious that at least to this member of the arresting team, there was some reason to suspect or to fear that the petitioner was armed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.955" offset="13407169">It's obvious that the agent in charge, who went in with his gun drawn, was expecting some danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.776" offset="13434441">The situation just on its face does indicate there is a substantial danger, and if the petitioner is armed, he will either resist arrest, or injure the informant, who has been left in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.035" offset="13507480">I think that under the -- that these circumstances would justify the officers in not announcing their purpose before they entered, even if the door had been locked.</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.688" offset="14262105">Mr. Chief Justice may it appease the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.112" offset="14267852">I'll just take a moment or two to respond to a couple of the points Mr. Martin made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.808" offset="14286555">First, with respect as to whether or not this question is right for a decision by this Court, I think the dispositive answer to that Your Honors is just the fact that the Court of Appeals below was met with the same argument by the government, and they undertook to pass on the question on its merits, and to render a decision which was contrary to the rulings of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia thereby presenting a clear conflict between circuits on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.424" offset="14389060">In a similar situation, in Jones versus United States, 362 US, the Court of -- this Court decided to decide a question which had not been properly been raised at the trial Court, in fact, involving the very same statute on the ground that the Court of Appeals had undertaken to decide the question on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.819" offset="14466696">I think the same result is required in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.284" offset="14484459">But beyond that, the record, it seems to me, it makes it perfectly clear that the two contingencies which the government has indicated should be further explored or should have been further explored at the trial, are not really -- do not cast any doubt upon what actually happened when the police officers went in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.703" offset="14562200">There's no doubt from the record that the officers did not make any announcement whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.744" offset="14586337">The officers testified at great length about the events and circumstances which led up to their entry into the apartment, and how they entered the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.265" offset="14620400">And it's perfectly clear from the testimony of the Officer in Charge on page 21 of the appendix, that no announcement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.962" offset="14647254">In fact, he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.393" offset="14652897">I knocked on the door, waited a few seconds, and no answer came from within, so I opened the unlocked door, and came into the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.287" offset="14680482">Now, surely, if he had made an announcement in describing how he entered the apartment, he would have indicated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.172" offset="14704097">In addition with respect to the so-called exigent circumstances that the government realized upon the record, simply does not show that the police had any reason whatsoever to believe that either Jones or themselves were in any peril.</text>
