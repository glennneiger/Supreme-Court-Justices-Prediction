            <label>Mr. Alan M. Wilner</label>
            <text syncTime="61.422" offset="349080">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.540" offset="353573">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.483" offset="369351">This appeal asks whether the 1966 Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act which I shall refer to hereafter as Public Law 89601 are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.092" offset="419715">Specifically, it asks whether or not Congress can extend the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local school and hospital employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.540" offset="461511">Now leaving aside for the moment the question of the Eleventh Amendment and the statutory question of whether the states or the ultimate consumers of the goods which they purchase in Commerce, we view this case as involving two essential issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.597" offset="525772">We do not of course mean to abandon either the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory construction argument, but we would prefer to rest upon our brief as to those arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.298" offset="572583">The first issue is whether the activity being regulated has a sufficiently substantial effect on interstate commerce to be constitutionally regulable by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.929" offset="619081">Now, this does not involve any consideration of whether the Commerce Clause is plenary or exclusive or just how powerful it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.531" offset="653458">It does not involve the Tenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.149" offset="664012">The only consideration here is whether the activity is or affects commerce in such a way as to make it regulable per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.961" offset="703195">The second issue is if the Court in examining the activities under consideration, determines that they are or substantially affect commerce, it must then determine the nature and extent of the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.684" offset="762128">It is at this point that the question of whether our federal system itself is an implied limitation on the commerce power comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.728" offset="802252">Now there are as the Court may know, 28 states who are appellants here, obviously more than one point of view has been expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.858" offset="838823">Professor Wright my co-counsel in his brief has addressed himself primarily to the first issue and he will argue that today.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.515" offset="873409">Accordingly, I shall address myself to the second issue that is whether assuming that the activities affect commerce or our commerce the fact that they are carried on by states under the circumstances present here precludes Congress from regulating them in a way that it is sought to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.431" offset="953135">Now we assert initially as our basis, as this Court itself said in the case of Texas versus White that the preservation of the states and the maintenance of their governments is as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the union and the maintenance of the national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.615" offset="1033801">We start with that as our premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.255" offset="1044355">Less it'd be said that this is a pass√©, no longer good law, I would point out to the Court that this very language and this very context was cited with approval by Mr. Justice Frankfurter only eight years ago in the concurring opinion in United States versus Florida, reported at 363 U.S. 121 his particular language at 132.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.978" offset="1147277">The Secretary of Labor asserts that this is no consideration in ascertaining the scope of the commerce power and for that, he relies on language of this Court in the cases of United States versus California, 297 U.S., Case versus Bowles, reported at 327 U.S. and Board of Trustees versus United States reported at 289 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.073" offset="1243617">Now, it is our position that the actual decisions in these cases are not controlling here that the degree of federal intrusion upon the states is entirely different and so are its effects and we urge that the Court reconsider the dicta and we submit and will attempt to demonstrate that that's all that it was that the Court reconsider the dicta in those cases in the light of the facts involved here and because this is central to our argument, I would like to develop this in some depth now.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.003" offset="1375378">As we point out in our brief, from almost the very beginning, there had been an implied limitation upon the national taxing power where state governmental activities were concerned and until the case of United States versus California, there had been no occasion to conclude that the commerce power was not subject to the same limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.478" offset="1465240">At least, I might point out that in the California case where the distinction, so far as I'm able to determine was for the first time made, the Court cited no previous authority for making the distinction between the taxing and commerce power and I refer to the Court to 297 U.S. at page 185 where this distinction was first made.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.033" offset="1551548">In California of course, the question was whether the state owned belt railway was subject to the Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.814" offset="1586657">California argued that the railroad was owned and operated as a sovereign function of the state, relying on the doctrine of immunity which had been evolved from the tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.495" offset="1629393">Now the Court never stopped to analyze even, whether even under the taxing doctrine, that is with the limitations imposed upon the taxing power, the railroad would be immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.993" offset="1675368">But instead asserted, I submit quite unnecessarily, that the limitations applicable to the taxing power were not applicable to the commerce power and on that basis, the railroad could be regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.480" offset="1729285">Now, I say that the distinction raised in that case was unnecessary because the facts will demonstrate that the railroad was not only regulable under the commerce power, but also taxable under the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.959" offset="1783202">In the later case, in the State of California versus Anglim decided some seven years after the California case in this Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the same belt railroad was not immune from the federal carrier's tax of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.424" offset="1853106">I might mention that perhaps the Chief Justice may have some special recollection of that case having come up under his tenure as Attorney General of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.110" offset="1895842">The District Court in the Anglim case expressly held that the railroad was not an essentially and traditionally governmental function and for that reason was taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.844" offset="1942758">This decision is reported at 37 Fed Supp at page 667.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.078" offset="1963656">The Circuit Court agreed entirely with the lower court's approach reporting its decision at 129 F2nd 460.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.930" offset="2003048">The Circuit Court also went on the theory that the Taxing Act was a commerce regulation, but it expressly agreed with the District Court's conclusion that as a factual matter, it was -- the railroad was also taxable under the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.333" offset="2064697">This Court denied certiorari at 317 U.S. 669 and in fact I think had implicitly accepted the Circuit and District Court approaches in the earlier case of California versus Latimer at 305 U.S. 255 where it sustained a different aspect of the carrier's tax of 1937 against the very same belt railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.638" offset="2165948">Thus, I submit to the Court that the distinction raised in the first California case with respect to the very activity which was there under consideration amounted to unnecessary dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.460" offset="2217253">The same result would have been reached whether the taxing power or the commerce power was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.845" offset="2242748">The railroad was not an essentially -- an essential governmental function and that is why it could be regulated and taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.854" offset="2278797">Now the idea that the taxing power is somehow less potent or somehow more limited than the commerce power it was not supported by precedent and in fact was rejected later by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.609" offset="2337834">As a general proposition, the taxing power has been described many times by this Court in the same broad way as it has described the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.905" offset="2379003">In Tanner versus Little for example, an early case reported the 240 U.S. 369, the Court said that the power of taxation is as extensive as the range of subjects over which the government extends.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.905" offset="2435009">It is absolute and unlimited in the absence of constitutional limitations and restraints and carries with it the power to embarrass and destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.849" offset="2474820">Not only has a taxing power been described in this very broad way on its own but it has also been equated with the other plenary enumerated powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.399" offset="2521004">In the case of Ashton versus Cameron County for example, reported at 298 U.S. 513, which I might add was decided after the California case, the Court equated the tax and the bankruptcy powers stating ‚Äúboth powers are granted by the same section of the Constitution and we can find no reason for saying that one is implied limited by the necessity of preserving independence of the states while the other is not.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="635.035" offset="2643466">Even more specifically to the point, ‚Äúthe Court in the same case stated at page 532 that for a very long time, this Court has steadfastly adhered to the doctrine that the taxing power of Congress does not extend to the states where there are political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.006" offset="2711385">The same basic reasoning which leads to that conclusion we think, requires like limitation upon the power which springs from the Bankruptcy Clause.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="663.244" offset="2756315">Later, in the case of New York versus United States, the famous tax case with the mineral waters Justice Frankfurter referring to the California case stated, ‚Äúthat surely the power of Congress to lay taxes has impliedly no lesser reach in the power of Congress to regulate commerce.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="683.080" offset="2835728">Now, it serves no real purpose I think to bounce cases back off against one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.277" offset="2868433">What we must do now is look to the basic underlying legal concepts which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.325" offset="2896645">Now in California, the Court assumed that the reason for the limitation on the taxing power was to enable each government to tax freely.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.926" offset="2931127">This is what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.871" offset="2938859">In the earlier case of Metcalf versus Mitchell however, the Court stated the rationale in this words, ‚Äúbut neither government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="724.205" offset="3000195">Now, this I submit is a far broader basis for the limitation than that which was expressed in the California case and I think it strikes more to the heart of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.612" offset="3041782">It is also the approach which was adopted by all eight justices in the case of New York versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.117" offset="3071875">Justice Frankfurter stated in the New York case that ‚Äúthe fact that ours is a federal constitutional system as expressly recognized in the Tenth Amendment carries with it implications regarding the taxing power as in other aspects of government,‚Äù citing his authority, Hopkins Federal versus Cleary, which of course involved a limitation on the commerce and banking powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.728" offset="3182320">Now, as a result of the Anglim cases, the California belt railroad tax cases as a result of Ashton versus Cameron and of New York versus United States and as a result of the other cases which we cite in our brief and which I don't think it's important to go into at this stage, it would appear that the distinction which was raised in the first California case was inappropriate and no longer recognized, but then it was repeated in the case of Case versus Bowles reported at 327 U.S. 92.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.022" offset="3315440">Now, in Case versus Bowles, the Court rejected the distinction between essential and nonessential state functions with respect to the war power because it appeared to be unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.765" offset="3362461">This is what the Court said, citing the New York tax case in which the Court was unable to arrive at any agreement as to where the balance would be struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.574" offset="3405720">Based upon the New York case, the court just said, -- simply said, it seemed to me that ‚Äúwe can't work out any kind of balance therefore there isn't any.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="835.006" offset="3443440">Now, in that case, the question was whether the power of the State of Washington to sell timber to the highest bider was subordinate to the OPA Ceiling Price Regulations which had been issued pursuant to the war power.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.287" offset="3504567">In that context, the essential and nonessential distinction which had been raised as a test by some of the justices in the New York tax case which had been accepted before in tax cases may well had been unworkable and maybe that distinction is unworkable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.312" offset="3576665">But even that would not mean that no limitation is to be implied because I submit that theory itself would be unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.602" offset="3609788">To demonstrate this, I ask the Court to look at what Public Law 89601 actually does.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.727" offset="3642284">Now in the middle of a fiscal year that is after state budgets had already been enacted, after the next necessary taxes had been levy, along comes Congress and raises the pay of state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.238" offset="3696306">Now we stipulated below and the record will indicate that the cost of this to the state just the monetary cost alone would be enormous, perhaps $100 million to $200 million annually, whether it's 200 or 100 we submit as terribly significant, but it would be somewhere in that neighborhood for the first year of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.818" offset="3782614">Of course --</text>

            <text syncTime="952.470" offset="3913226">This is primarily overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.555" offset="3921586">What this Act does essentially without getting into the statutory problems of it, is to eliminate the device of compensatory time which all levels of government have used for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.482" offset="3973308">That is if an employee works, if the wage, if the hourly thing is 40 hours and an employee works 44 hours in one week, he would be given four hours off at some other time and he could accumulate these extra hours so he could take a whole day off and this worked well in both the federal and the state systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.444" offset="4065155">The effect of this Act is that unless the compensatory time can be given within the same pay period, the state can no longer use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.003" offset="4099427">It must pay a premium overtime and it is this of course which applies not only to people making a dollar an hour but people to making $10.00 an hour as well and it's this which affects the primary -- the major cost burden because we stipulated below and the record will show that in many instances, it's just impossible for state governments to compensate their people within the same pay period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.519" offset="4213426">I think the very events of the past two weeks with these disturbances in the city will demonstrate with all of the overtime that had to be paid under this Act if it were applicable to those people and the constitutional question would be that it could be --</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.254" offset="6956387">Now we are submitting to the Court how is this commerce power any different when it is used this way when they tell the states how much taxes to levy, how to appropriate tax derived revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.179" offset="7016051">We submit that there's no logical distinction between these two powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.602" offset="7033814">The rationale for limiting the scope of one is the rationale for limiting the scope of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.244" offset="7056384">Now, if this approach is adopted, if the tax limitations are implied on the commerce power, we don't consider that it would be terribly unworkable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.959" offset="7095254">It would only mean that this Court will act to -- view acts of Congress in the light of whether they seriously intrude upon basic functions of state government and you don't need clich√©s like essential or governmental or sovereign to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.878" offset="7154918">You don't need a mathematical formula.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.717" offset="7202252">What you've got to do is to examine this Act, look at what it does and determine whether it's so interferes with states as states that exceeds the national power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.281" offset="7248541">This will have to be done I submit on a case by case basis looking at each act individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.188" offset="7272155">Out of this perhaps will involve some guidelines but this need not be made explicit now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.352" offset="7296815">All that is required now is to recognize that federalism is an implied limitation on federal power and to decide on whatever test is adopted if you accept the limitation that this act, Public Law 89601 exceeds that limitation and is therefore void.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.125" offset="7739852">I intend to address myself primarily to the Commerce Clause issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.146" offset="7763989">They are as Mr. Wilner said issues of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.176" offset="7776110">There is no case that I can point to nor I think that the Solicitor General can point to that tells us unerringly the answer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.060" offset="7807561">But there are in my judgment principles that furnish guides to right decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.621" offset="7829817">I start out with the fact that the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states and I take the words among the several states are words of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.153" offset="7879973">They were not used by the framers and put them at the document longer and there is a difference between a plenary power to regulate all commerce and the power to regulate commerce among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.908" offset="7935039">I suggest first that where in fact we have commerce among the several states and this is undoubtedly a conception that has expanded as our transportation network and our economy expanded, but here, there is of course no doubt whatever about Congress' power to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.130" offset="8007868">Second, where we have an activity that is local, it may still have such an impact on commerce among the several states that it must be held to be within the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.935" offset="8059068">This is a lesson that Texas learned in 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.425" offset="8073070">Third, that when the relation between local activity and commerce among the several states is not sufficiently close then the power of Congress has come to an end as Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said in what remains the authoritative exposition of the Congress Clause, it will be inconvenient and absolutely unnecessary for the Congress to have been given a complete power over all commercial activity and he drew the line in saying that Congress can regulate that commerce that concerns more states than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.180" offset="8228133">The problem then becomes one of measuring the relation between a local activity at interstate commerce and decided when that relationship is close enough so that Congress may properly invoke its powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.737" offset="8286333">The Court has used various terms in recent history and we rely only on the cases from 1937 on, close and substantial, close and intimate, substantial and harmful, all of these terms suggest that there must be a propinquity between the activity and substantiality.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.408" offset="9424959">It seems to me that if Congress is to regulate a particular activity or a particular function of the state institution, it must be because that activity or that function have the needed relation to commerce among the several states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.033" offset="12375542">This case I think illustrates the growth and development of constitutional law and practice in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.038" offset="12427473">Of course in the sense, the problem of intergovernmental immunities goes back to the early days, Mcculloch and Maryland, but I suppose that two years ago -- excuse me, two generations ago, two generations go, no one would have been here standing in my place seeking to support a statute such as this, among other things there was no such statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.496" offset="12565400">We should not forget however that it was about two generations ago that South Carolina against United States was decided which held that the United States could impose a tax on an activity conducted by the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.528" offset="12645439">One generation ago, there were marked developments in this area, particularly in the tax field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.652" offset="12689951">There was a whole series of cases which step by step moved along and eventually broke down in large measure, the rigidities of the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunities -- intergovernmental immunities in the tax field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.003" offset="12783365">I think it's not irrelevant to point out too that it was 48 years ago next month that a very parallel case was argued before the high court of Australia, the Engineers case which is reported in 28 Common Law of Law Reports at page 129 which involved the power of the Commonwealth to enact a statute subjecting state employees, in this case it's railroad, to the compulsory arbitration law of the Commonwealth of Australia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.956" offset="12951176">I was reading about this just the other evening and noted that counsel for the Commonwealth in that case was Robert Gordon Menzies and every state, but one joined in opposition to the statute there and counsel for the states included John G. Latham who later became Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and Herbert Evatt who was later a justice of the High Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.651" offset="13078026">In this case, the syllogism, it seems to me it's fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.218" offset="13104253">I know the dangers of syllogisms and the risk that a legal problem may be over simplified by treating it in unduly logical terms, nevertheless it maybe of assistance to see how this case fits into the constitutional picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.479" offset="13201324">First, it seems to me that there is no doubt in the operation of schools and hospitals is an activity which affects commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.950" offset="13251166">The stipulations in this case show that the schools and hospitals in the states here involved affect the commerce in a very substantial way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.683" offset="13290141">The court below and its opinion and its quoted on page 9 of our brief, in reference to the stipulation which says that in the current fiscal year which was two or three years ago, an estimated 33 and three tenths billion dollars will be spent by state and local public educational institutions in the Unites States in the same fiscal year of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.075" offset="13403721">These authority spent $3.9 billion operating public hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.981" offset="13439248">If it were not the states which were conducting these activities, it seems to me that there could be no question about the power of Congress to make the Fair Labor Standards Act applicable to schools and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.986" offset="13515316">We know that the Act is applicable to retail stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.973" offset="13531303">We have cases like the heart of Atlanta case involving the extension of the commerce power to a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.127" offset="13575920">If these were privately conducted schools and hospitals, I think it could be hard to find counsel who would come here and contend that the act of Congress involved was not a regulation of activities which substantially affect commerce among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.169" offset="13652093">So we are dealing with the regulation of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.104" offset="13667767">I suggest that that's really beyond the realm of dispute now and that is the first proposition of the syllogism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.688" offset="13722102">Under the Constitution, the Congress has power to regulate commerce among the several states and this is a power granted without qualification in terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.439" offset="13777168">It applies to all commerce even that conducted by or for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.128" offset="13807888">And thus since we are dealing with a matter which substantially affects commerce and since the power of Congress to regulate commerce extends to commerce conducted by a state, we come to our conclusion that Congress has power to regulate wages and hours of employees in schools and hospitals even though these are conducted by a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.498" offset="13917393">Are there any flaws in this process?</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.188" offset="13932126">Are there subtleties or refinements which had been overlooked or submerged in the reasoning eye of outline?</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.773" offset="13970474">I do not think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.273" offset="13984475">For many years in the area of intergovernmental immunities in the tax field, the Court labored to workout a distinction between activities which were governmental in nature and those which were proprietary in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.801" offset="14062529">Some of the tax cases cited in the briefs here have been distinguished by my learned friends on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.826" offset="14110699">This distinction was undoubtedly a useful stage in the process, but it was found in due course that the distinction is one which did not prove to be useful in the long run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.577" offset="14169631">On what basis is such a matter to be determined as far as such a case as this is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.299" offset="14204531">Historically, neither elementary schools nor hospitals were conducted by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.005" offset="14239431">They are not analytically a part of governmental activity like legislatures and courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.059" offset="14275584">In more recent times, the states have become extensively involved in elementary education and hospitals, but these activities are not exclusively conducted by states and any of the plaintiff states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.242" offset="14356355">The Congress has long followed a policy of regulating wages and hours of work and activities which affect commerce and has been steadily extending its legislation to cover a very large part of the total area where interstate commerce is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.574" offset="14457710">It is earnestly contended here that this regulation is not necessary and it is not valid because the operation of schools and hospitals to quote from one of the headings in the state's brief, does not constitute commerce and does not affect commerce in a way which subjects them to congressional regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.450" offset="14561155">The argument in support of this is put almost entirely in competitive terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.382" offset="14588949">It is suggested for example that private schools and hospitals will not have difficulty in competing if they are subjected to federal wage and hour regulation while state schools and hospitals are not because competition between these groups does not exist and to the extent it does exist, it is not on a price basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.418" offset="14697096">I'm not sure that even in the area of competition that it is as simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.276" offset="14724472">As a matter of fact in recent years, we have developed enormous systems of insurance with respect to medical cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.139" offset="14759894">This is true at least as far as the hospitals are concerned and not only Blue Cross on a national scale, but private insurance plans and payments are made in very large amounts to state and other public institutions for medical and hospital service and there may well be competition between the two, but I don't think that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.060" offset="14887581">I don't think that competition is the ground upon which this statute should particularly be rested even though that is the matter which was referred to in the committee report which related to hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.642" offset="14957902">Incidentally it is true as far as elementary and secondary education is concerned that this statute was passed in what might be called almost casual manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.610" offset="15017775">There were no hearings, but I don't know that Congress is under any obligation to hold hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.113" offset="15039822">There are no findings in the statute, but there are no constitutional requirement that there would be findings in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.706" offset="15078170">The speculation is that the provision with respect to elementary and secondary schools was put in by an opponent by the Bill who wanted to sink it by putting in so many things that people wouldn't vote for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.300" offset="15136580">Apparently to his surprise, it was adopted and then accepted by the conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.166" offset="15164061">All of which I think is irrelevant because it is in the statute as passed by Congress and as we see it, it was plainly within the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.855" offset="15226755">But as I have said, though I think there is competition and I think it could be advanced in terms of competition, that isn't the only basis upon which Congress can exercise its power to regulate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.871" offset="15294882">The Constitution doesn't say that Congress shall have power to regulate competition in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.654" offset="15317974">It says, Congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the federal state -- among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.908" offset="15347022">And the Congress seeks to regulate wages and hours not merely to provide a better basis for truly fair competition, but also to minimize work stoppages from legitimate employee discontent and also to increase purchasing power which will directly affect the flow of goods in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.425" offset="15441063">There can be no doubt, I suggest that the succession of statutes which the Congress passed beginning in the 1930s, not only Fair Labor Standards Act but also on employment insurance and old age and survivors insurance has had an enormous impact on the development and continuity of commerce and of commerce among the several states in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.972" offset="15563212">The strikes in schools and even in hospitals are not unknown even in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.563" offset="15597589">We've cited on page 12 of our brief an important study of strikes by public employees which deals among other things with the strikes by public employees in schools and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.486" offset="15649311">There is another aspect of the matter which is born in upon our consciousness over the past few weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.851" offset="15678777">A very large proportion of the employees in public schools and hospitals who receive less than the minimum wage or work more than maximum hours are in the poverty group and the Congress might well feel that removing a part of the economic discrimination against them which they've long contended against could have an important bearing on maintaining the stability of the free flow of commerce in the institutions in which these people worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.114" offset="15827780">What is the web of cases which has been spun over the past 40 years or more and which I suggest now enmeshes the plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.851" offset="15898728">Perhaps, the earliest case that need to be mentioned is Sanitary District of Chicago against the United States, decided in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.236" offset="15960273">This involved a clearly governmental activity, namely the disposition of sewage in the City of Chicago which had a direct relation to the health of Chicago and of other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.710" offset="16046164">This Court held that a statute enacted by Congress in regulating that activity under the Commerce Clause was valid and that speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, the power and authority of the United States to remove obstructions to interstate foreign commerce was without question superior to that of the states to provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.465" offset="16201226">Then the next case came along, United States against California, involving the San Francisco belt harbor railroad and the question was whether the Federal Safety Appliance Act was applicable to such a railroad conducted by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.127" offset="16315852">Now my friends here of course seek to distinguish the case on the ground that that was a proprietary activity, the distinction which was developed in the tax cases, but which was later pretty thoroughly disposed of, but in that case the Court was very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.520" offset="16409475">It said ‚Äúthat it deemed it unimportant to say whether the state conducts its railroad in its sovereign or in its private capacity.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.624" offset="16461824">In whatever capacity the Court said, ‚Äúthe state's power must be insubordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce which has been granted specifically to the national government.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.768" offset="16530474">In somewhat similar case that I'll take up out of chronological order is California against Taylor which involved the application of the Railway Labor Act to the same railroad and the Court there said that the state by engaging in interstate commerce has subjected itself to the commerce power so that Congress can regulate its employment relationships, now that of course gets very close to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.384" offset="16676864">A case which I think is of special importance here and one for which I have certain nostalgic feeling since I wrote the brief for the government in it, is Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois against the United States, decided in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.404" offset="16769024">It was argued here by Judge Thacher as Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.649" offset="16793997">That involved the application of customs duties to scientific apparatus which was imported by the University of Illinois and I remember well in the consideration of the case the discussion of the relative position of the taxing power and the power to regulate foreign commerce and we deliberately based the brief in that case on the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.514" offset="16929416">We made only casual or incidental reference to the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.742" offset="16958360">I would point out too that that case involves education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.157" offset="16976018">This was the University of Illinois, an educational institution and the items which were imported were scientific equipment for use in the education enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.923" offset="17043101">The Court in an opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, a very, well I want to say a curt but a short opinion, referred to the commerce power as an exclusive power and its exercise may not be limited, qualified or impeded to any extent by state action and he then went on to say the fact that the state in the performance of state functions may use imported articles does not mean that the importation is a function of the state government independent of federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.119" offset="17211852">The control of importation does not rest with the state, but with the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.002" offset="17239333">There is thus no violation of the principle which the petitioner invokes which was the principle of intergovernmental immunities for there is no encroachment on the power of the state as none exists with respect to the subject over which the federal power has been exerted.</text>

            <text syncTime="4420.158" offset="17784038">I do think that the case of the Board of trustees of University of Illinois against United States comes very close to this case when you get done to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.352" offset="17828760">It's easy to toss it off and say, oh it was a tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="4453.714" offset="17918203">Now the next one of these cases is the one involving price control, Case against Bowles also involves education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.108" offset="17971806">It involved the sale of Timber from lands held by the State of Washington for the support of public schools in that state and the state sought to sell them at the -- sell the timber at the best price it could get and they run into trouble with the Emergency Price Control Act and in the case which came to this Court, the power of Congress through that statute to regulate the prices at which state timber could be sold involving proceeds which would be used for school purposes, that statute was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.363" offset="18148812">And now finally, we have a very recent case, the significance of which I think might possibly be minimized because it is a per curiam decision and somehow or rather per curiam decisions get in the back of the back and are overlooked unless the facts aren't stated and that unless they are specifically brought out, they sometimes do not have the effect that case have decided by opinion do have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.353" offset="18288828">The case I'm referring to is 380 ‚Äì is United States against Ohio in 385 U.S. at page 9.</text>

            <text syncTime="4557.428" offset="18333132">Its way in the front but it's only two lines long.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.057" offset="18351626">United States against Ohio involved wheat grown on a state prison farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.565" offset="18393631">It was grown by the State of Ohio without complying with the crop restriction provisions of a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.464" offset="18433233">Pursuant to an opinion of the state attorney general that since it was a state and since under the Constitution of Ohio, the wheat could not be sold outside the state that it did not involve commerce and was not subject to federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.433" offset="18517138">The United States sued to collect the penalty which was due from persons who operated areas growing wheat in excess of their allowance and the District Court granted judgment to the United States for some $27,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.607" offset="18593834">That was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which took a position somewhat like that presented here by counsel for the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.383" offset="18644929">They said, well, this is such a little effect on Commerce that we can't really suppose that it ought to be something that the Congress could regulate and they reversed the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.769" offset="18706474">In the summer of 1966, the then Solicitor General filed a petition for certiorari with this Court to review that judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and in October of that year, that petition was granted and the judgment was reversed without argument here on the authority of the case of Wickard against Filburn which had extended the -- which had sustained the extension of the commerce power to the growing of crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.001" offset="18867388">Now, that gets even closer to governmental activity it seems to me than schools and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.256" offset="18908348">Prisons have long been a governmental activity and no one else can conduct prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.542" offset="18945546">It doesn't perhaps go as far as legislatures and courts Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.932" offset="18975117">I would suppose however if the legislature itself grew some wheat that this case would be applicable to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.218" offset="19020257">And I would suggest that it's very hard to get away from the application of the University of Illinois and the State of Ohio in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.417" offset="19081070">There is one more case mentioned in our brief, Oklahoma against Guy F. Atkinson Company where it was contended that the federal government have no power to build a dam because some of the lands which would be affected would be state lands and this was important not merely from the proprietary point of view but also from the governmental point of view because it would interfere with the state taxing power and among other things in some way would obliterate the boundary of the state, but the Court had no difficulty there in sustaining the power of Congress to authorize the building of the dam under its power to regulate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.558" offset="19285556">A number of other cases are discussed in our brief and even more in the brief for the appellant states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.936" offset="19331114">They seem to me to show that the time has passed when the argument which counsel for the appellants are making here can be a successfully made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.208" offset="19400182">We believe that this is a regulation of commerce whether it is one which should be made, was one for the judgment of Congress and Congress has made that judgment of the fact that states are affected at least in these operations is not sufficient to eliminate the power of Congress over commerce and accordingly we submit that the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="4864.494" offset="19561305">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.134" offset="19575933">I have certainly failed to communicate what our position is if I have led the learned Solicitor General to suppose that it resembles the position the Sixth Circuit took in United States v. Ohio, a position that quite accurately describes as being, well, it's just a little wheat there for it doesn't have much effect in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.244" offset="19668302">The position we take here fully accepts Wickard v. Filburn and it seem to me that United States v. Ohio was an a fortiori case from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.343" offset="19704769">The Court will recall that in Wickard, Justice Jackson examined at some length the economics of the wheat industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.643" offset="19729951">He found as I recall that about 20% of all wheat is consumed at the place where it grown.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.116" offset="19759835">This is the single most variable factor in the market and therefore the factor that had the most impact on the price of wheat moving in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.039" offset="19799542">And although the amount of wheat consumed in the Ohio jail or in Filburn's farm by itself was insignificant taken as a whole the problem of home consumed wheat was one of great importance if commerce would be effectively regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.652" offset="19865997">That is far different from our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.695" offset="19874147">We're not saying that what our people do as something so trivial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.284" offset="19900479">We're saying simply that it is something that doesn't affect interstate commerce.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="4956.386" offset="19928900">Well, then it must be your position Professor Wright that the wages paid to people per se will not affect interstate commerce and now let's suppose you had a monopoly, pure monopoly to then compete with anybody, just assume that with me if you will, and it's general activities are such to bring it within the interstate commerce category but that doesn't compete with anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.832" offset="20042689">The federal government regulates wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.870" offset="20062856">There's a fact that there is no competitive factor there excluded from the scope of the commerce power.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="4998.606" offset="20097755">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.843" offset="20106742">I don't have to think that competition is by any means the only factor that may permit the Congress to invoke the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.723" offset="20142268">I think that this is one of the things one looks to and determining is their -- the relation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.033" offset="20175496">Mr. Justice White's questions dramatized for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.457" offset="20197230">The difficulty I had with the syllogism imposed by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.994" offset="20223352">I cannot say on the argument as he puts it how there is any stopping point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.220" offset="20252296">I do not see with regard to his made true premise how there could be any limit on the concept of commerce among the several states that the hearings leading to the 1966 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.941" offset="20311124">The Secretary of Labor told the Congress for example that it was beyond its power to fix minimum wages for a truck driver if he drove with his truck only in intrastate commerce and yet I dare say that a truck or the gasoline it uses or things at that sort would be bought out of the state and the possibility of a work stoppage would be as real or as unreal in its impact on commerce as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.423" offset="20421047">With regard to the minor premise put by the Solicitor General, I suggest again that the Congress can bring the states within some regulations of commerce, but because states are states, they do not exist merely at the pleasure of a transient majority of the Congress and that their interferences with the function of a state in its capacity as a constituent partner in the federal union, the Congress cannot touch --</text>

            <text syncTime="5116.594" offset="20569736">Yes and in my judgment Mr. Justice White the two arguments fit together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.758" offset="20602441">You can't separate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.117" offset="20623862">There was a time when it was the practice in this Court to strike down acts of Congress because the majority of the Court thought that the act of Congress was a bad thing and I'm sure that my friend and I would make common cause in saying that that was an inappropriate approach to judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.467" offset="20721246">I submit that it would be equally wrong for this Court to uphold an act of Congress because it accomplishes something that we may think is good.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.797" offset="20758549">The question in either event is not whether we like or dislike what the Congress has done, it is whether the Congress is active in the powers that the Constitution of the United States pressed in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.213" offset="20804211">As a voter and a taxpayer in Texas, I would be happy to support a state minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.062" offset="20827617">As a citizen of the United States, I do not think that the Congress of the United States have the power that is here claimed.</text>
