            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">No. 127, Reading Company, petitioner, versus Francis Shunk Brown, 3d, etc.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Raeburn White, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="24.703" offset="202167">Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.089" offset="215751">This is a petition for the review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, a bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.288" offset="248560">And the issue before the court is whether a claim for damages arising out of the negligence of the receiver while operating a business during in -- a Chapter XI proceeding, what subsequently became a bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.107" offset="315852">Is an expense of administration with the priority to which such expenses are entitled or whatever it has no standing whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.084" offset="359737">The I.J. Knight Realty Corporation owned and operated an eight-story industrial building in Philadelphia known as the Fretz Building.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.496" offset="397354">And on November the 16th 1962, Knight filed a petition for arrangement under Chapter XI and the District Court for the Houston District appointed a receiver and authorized him to operate the business which he proceeded to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.571" offset="473631">Six weeks later, on the first of January 1963, the Fretz Building was totally destroyed by a disastrous fire which has been described as the worst fire that Philadelphia ever had.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.880" offset="526921">And a large number of adjoining structures were destroyed and damaged including a property going to the Reading Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.347" offset="572792">The receivership was subsequently terminated and Knight was adjudicated of bankrupt and Brown was then elected trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.074" offset="607692">The Reading Company and over a hundred other property owners whose property was destroyed in the fire filed claims as administrative expenses due the negligence of the receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.274" offset="656488">And the trustee thereafter petitioned the referee to expunge the crime not only as an expense of administration but also as a general unsecured claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.975" offset="707271">The referee did expunge the claims, expunged the Reading Company claim and he also ruled that the Reading Claim should be a test case for all of the hundred some odd other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.832" offset="766725">There are approximately three and a half million dollars in claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.168" offset="784071">The assets -- the estimate at the time, the record was prepared, were between $638,045 and I believe that the -- that figure is more nearly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.235" offset="844361">The Government is in this case because it has a tax claim of some $245,000 relating to the pre-petitioned period and there were other claims amounting to about $378,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.471" offset="905279">The District Court for the Houston District affirmed the referee and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court with three judges dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.372" offset="948851">This Court granted certiorari on the 16th of October 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.352" offset="968808">And for purposes of this case, it is admitted that this fire was caused when an engineer hired by the receiver accidentally attached a portable heater to high-tension wires while working on some frozen sprinkler pipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.338" offset="1036727">Knight had been out of possession as I said for approximately six weeks so that the bankrupt could not be held responsible for the engineer's negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.515" offset="1081448">A consequent -- this is a claim against the receiver as such and has in our view an entirely different character from claims against the bankrupt which arose prior to the bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.539" offset="1141530">Now the cost of expenses of administration are provided for in Section 64a (1) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.757" offset="1174444">That Act -- that Section reads in part as follows, Debts which have priority, "The debts to have priority, in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and to be paid in full out of bankrupt estates, and the order of payment, shall be (1) the costs and expenses of administration, including the actual and necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate subsequent to filing the petition."</text>
            <text syncTime="296.125" offset="1287920">The term "cost and expenses" has never been defined by Congress and consequently, we argue that the term bears the meaning which had been required over the years in other insolvency proceedings, mainly equity receiverships.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.611" offset="1369840">Claims for torts committed in equity receiverships by agents of the receiver have absolutely uniformly been held to be expenses of administration and to be entitled a priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.716" offset="1422190">We've cited a large number of cases in our brief which of course, I'm not going to refer to but I would like to make one short -- read one short quotation by my -- decision by this Court, The Farmers' Loan and -- not but this Court -- sorry, it's a lower court case, the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company versus the Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.182" offset="1496064">Such claims for injuries occurring in the receiver's own management are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.792" offset="1514559">It is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.121" offset="1519888">In preference to the mortgaged debt not for the reason of their preferential nature nor because of any superior equity in their favor over claims for damages which arose before the receiver was appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.717" offset="1574222">But because there are liabilities which were incurred by the receiver in the course of his own operation of the road and are payable by him as other expenses of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.898" offset="1622915">Now, all of the text riders that we've been able to find, every single one without exception says that torts committed by a receiver in the operation of the business and I make no distinction between equity receiverships and bankruptcy receiverships, are expenses of administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.413" offset="1945057">Collier said so and it's interesting to me that the Government quotes Collier repeatedly as an authority but it does -- but in no place do they quote this action, it says that these are payable as expenses of administration.</text>
