            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="28.936" offset="115670">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, this case on clause appeals from the Tenth Circuit presents for the Court's consideration, the validity of the Federal Power Commission's first area rate determination fixing just and reasonable rates for the sale by producers of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.608" offset="246387">The particular decision here involves the so-called Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, which is a major producing area responsible for approximately 12% of the gas flowing in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.123" offset="328411">Off of this gas, roughly three-quarters, a little bit more than three-quarters, goes to the California market and the remainder to on-route are points in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and by another pipeline to the Midwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.826" offset="411272">The prices fixed by the Commission in this case will result in refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.370" offset="445440">That is refunds with respect to increased prices which had previously been suspended by the Commission and allowed to go into effect subject to the refund obligation of approximately $32 million plus interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.387" offset="517538">In addition, and certainly no less important, the decision will result in annual rate reductions beginning as of September 1st, 1965, the date of the Commission's decision, of approximately $16 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.431" offset="609698">But obviously, the decision although important for itself, has greater importance in establishing the legal framework for all producer ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.851" offset="671347">And this includes the four other cases that we now have before the Commission in various stages which together with Permian, when they are completed will fix the rates for gas flowing in interstate commerce approximately 93%.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.764" offset="750968">In other words, with these first five cases by process of packaging, we will be able to dispose of 93% of the gas flowing in the interstate commerce.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_a_solomon" startTime="200.799" stopTime="894.055">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="200.799" offset="803109">Yes sir, the one which is nearest to being completed is the Southern Louisiana area.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.542" offset="830067">There is a case involving the so-called Hugoton-Anadarko Area of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.059" offset="860160">There is a case which is concurrent with it which involves three of the Texas Railroad districts along the Gulf of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.379" offset="893492">And there are some newer cases which has packaged all of the areas in between in the southwest which probably will depend on how you split them up where they're closer to one group or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.956" offset="947722">Yes, it is different areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.719" offset="962873">We are strongly urging in this case that the Commission's decision be infirmed in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.915" offset="995579">Now, the genesis of the action under review here today is of course the Commission -- this Court's decision in 1954 in the Phillips case, hearing of 347.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.409" offset="1049600">It's first held with the rates which natural gas producers should sell their gas in the interstate commerce, are subject to regulation by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.067" offset="1088261">I don't think I really have to go into detail with this Court as to the history during the succeeding six years, or rather a board of history of the Commission's attempts to resolve this price in question by conventional individual company cost of service rate making technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.898" offset="1187527">As you are aware, in the second Phillips case, which in this Court is styled Wisconsin against the Federal Power Commission, decided in 1962 in Volume 373.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.379" offset="1261505">In the second Phillips case, the Commission reached the conclusion that the individual company prudent investment cost of service technique made no sense for the natural gas industry, economically, administratively does not acquire it legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.413" offset="1345620">Instead, it's cited that would institute these area rate proceedings of which this is the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.674" offset="1370593">In the interim, building on this Court's decision in the CATCO case, the Commission has utilized its conditioning authority under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, to as the Court put it, hold the line, this program has worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.322" offset="1449273">It does not only stopped the previous spiral of prices which the Court is aware of, but its resulted in the last seven years, in price reductions below contract levels which for the seven-year period have aggregated about $134 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.411" offset="1545613">And I want to say that there're another $20 million in refunds which will ride on the decision of this Court in another series of cases to be heard later this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.767" offset="1595037">The petition -- the Commission's 1960 Phillips decision decided that we were going to regulate by area rates, but I'm afraid, it's fair to say, a very little else.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.391" offset="1661492">Accordingly, when the Commission instituted the Permian proceeding which it did roughly two months thereafter, that on December 23rd, 1960, there were virtually no guidelines as to how the parties to -- should proceed, or for that matter, what the Commission's real intent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.012" offset="1748010">I very strongly suspect that this uncertainty together with certain language in the Phillips decision itself which could be read as indicating that the Commission would drop consideration of costs and rely largely on unregulated field prices was responsible for the unhappiness of the consumer interest such as the State of California, who unsuccessfully challenged the Phillips decision in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.514" offset="1874024">But as I will show, that if this was what they were afraid of, their fears have not -- their fears were unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.152" offset="1916552">I think it maybe helpful to the Court in evaluating the Commission's end product here.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.671" offset="1942674">If I briefly outline the procedure the Commission followed in reaching its decision, the order of December 23rd, 1960 named about 330 producing parties who were -- had filed rates on file in the Permian area as respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.798" offset="2039118">And in addition, about 47 other parties, some big and some small, were allowed to intervene in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.167" offset="2088647">The first thing that happened was that the Commission held a prehearing conference in Midland, Texas in March 1961, to try and workout with the party some way of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.997" offset="2151967">But again, I'm sorry to say that very little was accomplished here, except what I guess was important, a recognition that there wasn't any real agreement as to how area rates should be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.122" offset="2216438">The one thing that did come out of this proceeding in subsequent discussions among the parties was agreement that there should be a cost questionnaire developed by the Commission staff with the assistance of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.204" offset="2288744">And since it was recognized that the preparation and the filling out and compilation of this cost questionnaire was going to take time, it was decided that they would -- we would split up of the hearing and we would start the hearing with general evidence on the economic phases of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.916" offset="2399608">Now, this economic phase in the -- of the hearing were important phase of the hearing, started in October of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.210" offset="2452793">It started essentially with producer testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.253" offset="2472960">They stressed as one would expect the alleged existence of a free and competitive market for the sale of gas from producers to pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.307" offset="2529176">And the more -- they need to encourage gas exploration and development to meet the ever increasing demands for gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.407" offset="2581525">The producers in effect asserted that the only way the country was going to be able to get enough gas to meet these increasing needs was by substantial price encouragement to the producing industry to go out and explore for and develop new gas fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.459" offset="2677760">And this they suggest that in terms of the Permian Basin would necessitate a ceiling price of about 20 cents which was roughly about 4 cents higher than the going price for gas in Permian at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.160" offset="2756545">Now, in the course of this presentation, the producers presented some very significant and fairly unique as of that time evidence that the production industry which formulate had been very much tied together between the exploration and development of oil and gas, was that they were locked together whether they like it or not, that the production industry as of about the time of the beginning of this case, you can't fix a definite date, some people got this, what I'm about to say earlier, others who were getting it at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.234" offset="2940865">But roughly about this 1960 period, the production industry had developed the ability and capacity to explore and drill directly for gas reserves as contrasted with oil reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.131" offset="3012441">Now, the importance of this is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.532" offset="3030100">In the first place, it was important to the basic argument being made by the producers, because as long as gas is merely a byproduct of oil, the argument that you need very high prices to induce gas exploration obviously is not a very good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.837" offset="3115259">But if now for the first time, you could really explore for gas individually, and if you could decide where you're going to put your money, that price arguably became significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.648" offset="3206583">The producers put forward this directional argument as a contention that there should be a general increase in prices or at least a high ceiling applicable to all gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.648" offset="3286518">They did this despite the fact that a lot of the gas, flowing gas, was oil-well gas or what in this standpoint is the same thing, residue gas produced from oil-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.665" offset="3370632">Let me -- maybe I be better to find some terms that I'll be throwing around here.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.142" offset="3392470">By gas-well gas, we're talking about dry gas, gas which more or less is not connected with oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.359" offset="3437401">It's about -- it comes out of reservoirs which are not oil reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.813" offset="3455164">As we'll get into in a few minutes, there's a serious problem here too because gas-well gas or at least most gas-well gas does have some heavy hydrocarbons condensate which are liquefiable and which not only are liquefiable but which are probably more valuable economically if they are liquefied.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.821" offset="3551190">So we still have the condensate liquid problems to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.002" offset="3575954">But --</text>

            <text syncTime="903.504" offset="3613989">In Permian Basin, there was at the time of this decision still roughly two-thirds oil-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.821" offset="3651187">The Permian Basin essentially started out as being one of the big oil reservoirs of West Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.910" offset="3683579">But even in Permian Basin, the gas-well percentage is increasing nationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.669" offset="3718583">It is I think, almost up to 50% or maybe higher are -- well, 66% nationally now.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.045" offset="3840104">Well, you can't talk that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.246" offset="3848882">The original gas discoveries in Kansas or the thing which probably more than anything else started the natural gas industry is the pipeline industry was gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.427" offset="3897678">Then you've got a lot of this oil-well gas in the big developments in Texas, then in Northern Louisiana, and now the offshore gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.893" offset="3947520">A lot of the offshore gas which certainly bring major gas is coming in as gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.348" offset="3969358">It's exceedingly rich and condensate.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.469" offset="3981793">So we're not just talking about the natural gas industry, but it's not oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.965" offset="4019827">Well, the point I was making was that the -- this directional hypothesis were put forward as a general claim for a price increase, even though most of the gas in Permian to be priced was oil-well gas or residue derived from the oil ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.419" offset="4101642">And even though all of the flowing gas or practically all of the flowing gas had been developed prior to the time in which there was any significant directional search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.560" offset="4162142">Now, the reason for this of course and maybe I should mention this again because another basic fact is distinguished with this industry from certain others, is that gas is sold on 20-year contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.421" offset="4225672">Actually, these contracts after they expire they tend to be even further selling, gasses sold now which was developed 15 to 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.487" offset="4277917">And the flowing gas of 1960 isn't gas that was developed in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.464" offset="4309786">Now, based on the facts that I just mentioned and the recognition that gas-well gas is the need for the future, the distributors in their economic presentation put forward to the Commission a basic new approach to the whole subject of gas pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.820" offset="4415216">They relied largely on policy testimony by Dr. Alfred Kahn, the chairman of the Economics Department of Cornell University, has developed a more concrete terms by his economists statistician, what have you, colleagues of a private organization going under a rather fancy name of the National Economic Research Associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.399" offset="4521587">I would -– I should give any impression that this is a governmental body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.407" offset="4541544">And the distributors working through these people developed what has been known as the two-price system, which the Commission eventually adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.668" offset="4602671">They started from the premise and that there is a finite and discernible cost for the separate search development and production of gas as distinguished from oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.490" offset="4661917">And Dr. Kahn proposed that if this is the case, that the new gas-well gas, the gas of the future, the gas which was going to be responsive to price and was the gas that needed to adduced, should be separately priced from the old stuff and should be priced not on historical cost concepts but price on the basis of its own current cost for this search and discovery of gas, this of course would achieve a number of basic advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.003" offset="4851984">Afar from the least is that it would eliminate in this basic pricing determination many of the more difficult allocation problems which have driven us all mad in this case of trying to determine what the joint cost of oil and gas should be when they are joint product that people aren't -- are really operating one better than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.358" offset="4969430">And I said, there are still all these all problems of condensate but at least you got rid of the -- the oil part of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.035" offset="5060127">And if you look at the decision, you'll see for example that in this new gas-well pricing, instead of making an allocation of embedded cost, what the Commission was able to do using the information supplied in the record by both producers and distributors in picking and choosing the proper ones, was to price the gas and have priced the operation which leads to gas and have a condensate liquid credit based upon the value, and on regulated liquid business and simply determine that the liquid credit which is what these people are getting from liquids is the part of the cost which can be subtracted from gas, and to a large extent, avoid these allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.417" offset="5305574">Now, we do have some, I don't want to oversell this, like most things, this is a matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.161" offset="5336607">But if you will read the very good discussion on this in the Commission decision and the examiner's decision, you'll see that the very great advantages and improvements were made on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.545" offset="5394077">The other point I'm trying to make and certainly equally important is that by this two-price system based on a current cost for gas, we are able to adjust prospectively gas prices as conditions in the cost or otherwise required without automatically raising the price on oil as other flowing gas and giving windfalls to people who produce gas under very different conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.925" offset="5535660">This is not important in terms of the Permian decision that we have here before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.981" offset="5559902">This math that we could fix and did fix a cost based price for new pipeline gas of $16 and a half cents without affording the 2 cent windfall which would have resulted if we priced flowing gas at this price which on historical basis came out to $14 and a half cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.860" offset="5655406">Now of course, you could have done it another way, you could have combine these prices and come out with something in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.188" offset="5680692">But if you would have done that, maybe you would have avoided the windfall to a certain extent if not completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.018" offset="5712039">But you wouldn't have had as higher price for the new development and search as the Commission found was the appropriate price if you're going to induce enough gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.715" offset="5762821">Let me take sometime here, it's a useful thing to do, to discuss some of the arguments against this two-price system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.075" offset="5808274">Nobody was bored originally except the distributors, the staff of the Commission and the staff of the California Commission argued that this was all very well in theory but there really hadn't been much of the demonstration that this directional search had been put into effect as yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.803" offset="5895210">And they said that under these circumstances the historical method was appropriate, particularly since the evidence indicated that there were not any great price up trends in cost since about 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.580" offset="5962292">The Commission disagreed with this and concluded that the evidence did show that there was a real increasing directional ability here and that it would agree with the producer and distributor evidence on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.657" offset="6058527">And this of course required the rejection of the two staff's argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.561" offset="6422152">There are very good reasons for this which I will get into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.668" offset="6446602">The rejection upon the acceptance of directional capability did unfortunately require of the rejection by the Commission of a major pioneering effort by the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.477" offset="6529881">Our chief economist, Dr. Harold Warren had developed and put into evidence an econometric study attempting to relate supply and demand in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.948" offset="6595709">His study had not taken into account directionality and the Commission felt that as a result of this, that it was necessary to -- they couldn't rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.217" offset="6644820">The Commission noted with respect to this study as well as certain other imperfect pricing techniques which had been put forward here, it's hoped that future developers might make their use possible in subsequent proceedings, because I want to make it perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.814" offset="6731233">We're convinced that this present area rate decision is a good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.561" offset="6754220">Fully meeting the end requirement task of the Hope -- but we don't suggest it's the final word and we know that we're going to develop further insight into this problem with experience in the other cases and with experience in our future review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.785" offset="6831125">The producer argument of the gas two-price system, was of course that they should -- as I said, that they should get the higher price for all of their gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.705" offset="6878772">And it's most unsophisticated level that the argument is gas is gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.887" offset="6919523">And the consumer, the pipeline, can't tell whether a molecule was old gas or new gas, but therefore, even if the old gas had been developed as a pure byproduct of the search for oil, it should have the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.856" offset="6995383">We don't think this is a really a good argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.799" offset="7003115">This is the same type of argument that got this industry into trouble though the indefinite escalation clauses whereby everybody in the industry would always get the highest price that was being charged at a later date.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.817" offset="7175210">The fact is that gas maybe gas molecularly but the value of gas and the cost of gas at different times and on different circumstance are not the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.458" offset="7489829">Whether if you drill at this particular spot to a given level, that you're more likely to hit a gas reservoir as contrasted with an oil reservoir.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.846" offset="7591288">But it is pretty well established now that this industry does what inland -- know what it's going to search for when it's searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.686" offset="7646668">The other contention against the two-price system is that a one price high price should be allowed for all gas because revenues from gas have been the primary source for reinvestment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.669" offset="7718661">But as the Commission pointed out the allowances in the old gas price here, in over beyond out-of-pocket cost, the allowances for exploration and development in DD&amp;A depreciation, depletion and what's that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.037" offset="7804134">I forgot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.414" offset="7805597">In return, will all provide more than adequate revenues for reinvestment if the price is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.779" offset="7839033">If the price for new gas isn't right, it doesn't matter how much money you give for old gas, they'll simply put their money on other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.578" offset="7870276">Moreover, the producer just aren't restricted to old gas revenues, they have plenty of revenues from other sources which they'll put into gas if the price is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.756" offset="7922939">And they have accessed to equity and debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.793" offset="7935164">In short, gas exploration and development will continue as long as there's a profitable market for natural gas and won't continue if there isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.166" offset="7980617">The choice of the two-price system resulted in another problem for the Commission and that is the evidentiary problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.411" offset="8021577">As I indicated, we had agreed to prepare and did prepare with the cooperation of the producers and the distributors and the clients, a detailed cost questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.437" offset="8077688">The data from this cost questionnaire is very useful, subsequently used as the basic method of fixing the price for old flowing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.284" offset="8121051">It was also used to a very great extent for new gas but it was not adequate to this task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.795" offset="8151144">It was not adequate to this task because it had been geared at the beginning of this proceeding to a conventional historical cost approach and there was a lot of information which would need it if you're going to get a current cost for gas discovery which was just not in this cost questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.101" offset="8232333">Now this presented a problem but it was not an insoluble problem and the breach was filled and testimony by both producers and distributors, by a careful selection by expert witnesses of information taken from a variety of sources to supplement the cost information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.783" offset="8335047">These sources range from the United States Census of Mineral Industries, to a Chase Manhattan Bank gas survey, to information developed on a regular basis by the American Gas Association, the American Petroleum Institute, to trade publications such as the Oil &amp; Gas Journal and the World Oil Magazine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.715" offset="8698776">The Commission decided for the reasons that they explained in some detail that the new gas-well gas price would be based on national data or as part of a new discovery for the future generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.760" offset="8770978">The Commission also decided and utilized for Permian figures which are more directly related to Permian.</text>

            <text syncTime="2221.595" offset="8886335">The Commission also faced up to the question as to whether there was a justification or not in new gas-well price for separate deviations for this national law for Permian cited there was not, this has not been shown on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.616" offset="8962403">These selections were by no means one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.416" offset="8981629">I think it's fair to say that the examiner and the Commission costing is largely based from the evidence of Dr. Roseman (ph) who was a witness for the distributors, but there are situations in which the Commission found he was too low.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.246" offset="9068983">There areas where they picked other testimony which they thought better reflected the true fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.436" offset="9113704">This picking and choosing of statistical information of the pipe I'm talking about has been criticized in the briefs here primarily by the Sun Oil Company as being outrageous attempt to get away from anything which is real in the way of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.137" offset="9196460">It's surprising since Sun or the other producers were violently against the effort by the California Commission to adopt the uniform system of accounts during the course of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.588" offset="9254348">But actually Sun was right and California was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.653" offset="9270544">Because any efforts to adopt the uniform system of accounts which give the – which – we'd had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.436" offset="9301682">The beginning of this proceeding, it would have almost certainly not proved adequate to the past because this whole directional idea and lot of the other developments here were things which grew up in the course of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.306" offset="9357166">We picked and used on a thoroughly analyzed basis, good statistical sources by no means skew against the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.044" offset="9436160">We analyzed them to the best of our ability and the argument that we should have waited until there could be agreement as to a uniform system of accounting and statistical information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.541" offset="9514109">And then developed area rate making is of course only an argument that we should postpone, area rate making in depth, the Commission was not willing to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.189" offset="9572728">Sun is also challenged and maybe it's a good point to mention this, the data we used in pricing old gas-well gas, the flowing gas, now here the information from the cost questionnaire which we had agreed with in various parties was available and usable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.445" offset="9673770">And it was used as the basic way of pricing the old gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.646" offset="9706580">It was, however, and I think this is not unimportant, wasn't just on that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.253" offset="9728940">The examiner has suggested that there was a possibility of a technique of trending back the new gas-well prices that he had found on basis of cost trends over a period of years to get the old gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.448" offset="9797695">And the Commission used this technique as a check against its historical cost and technique and came out with a quite comparable figure of the old gas-well cost on a historical basis with about 14.39 or 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.573" offset="9890273">On the trend back, it was 14.67 or something like that and the Commission felt that this was a reasonable check on its figure which had grounded off to 14 and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.404" offset="9945548">Now, Sun objects to the Appendix B form which was the basic form, cost form, which were used for this old gas-well gas because it says it's unrepresented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.816" offset="10011167">In fact, this Appendix B form includes the cost for the producers who in Permian account for 85% of the gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.465" offset="10057770">Sun knew that the figure of 15% on some place or other achieves this figure of 15% by simply ignoring the fact that the Commission, to avoid the worst of these allocation problems, Justice Stewart, shows not to price oil-well gas, flowing oil-well gas at all, but instead priced gas-well gas and fixed the price of oil-well gas on a value basis at the same level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.680" offset="10182635">It also gets this low figure by of course of the Commission in another similar effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.693" offset="10210743">It didn't use the figures which we had on the record, in which of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.239" offset="10224953">It gives a slightly lower price relating to so-called combination of oil and gas leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.387" offset="10269466">Again, we avoided using these figure because it involved an allocation between oil and gas which we thought would produce a result less true than if we didn't used these figures at all and used the other mass of material we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.015" offset="10327980">The only real question as far as the use of the questionnaire information is concerned, as I said, is with respect to small producers and whether these costs are representative of the cost of small producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.299" offset="10969130">They just don't maintain the type of books upon which you can get any meaningful information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.622" offset="10990446">The Commission tried to handle this by providing for a simplified Appendix C questionnaire which was optional for small producers under 10 million Mcf a year and it didn't work very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.601" offset="11054393">Of about 285 small producers in this area, 25 of them chose to respond on Appendix B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.841" offset="11083337">That's the main one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.314" offset="11089189">A 130 responded on Appendix C, but of that information, only 60 of them had anything which you could even use for compositing the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.430" offset="11133701">It's true and an argument is made here that the composite cost of the 60 small producers who did submit usable material on Appendix C, are somewhat higher than the Appendix B clause which we used for old gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.104" offset="11208411">But it is also true that the 25 small producers who filed on Appendix B who went about as much gas as the 60 will file on Appendix C, it's slightly lower cost than the major producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.499" offset="11269956">Casting real doubt upon whether these higher costs on Appendix C were really meaningful, and moreover, if we had included these Appendix C clause in our old gas-well gas, which we did not, the total effect would have been roughly -- well, it's less than a mill, seven-tenths of a mill on the entire business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.101" offset="11368385">I don't want to give the impression that we -- in our decision here, as the result of this ignored small producer problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.402" offset="11397538">There isn't any evidence as far as I know that small producers really have lower cost on the overall basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.688" offset="11426691">There is some evidence that some other costs are lower such as drilling companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.391" offset="11441528">There are also evidence offsetting this that some of their cost -- pardon me, some of their costs are higher really, also evidence that some of their costs are lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.106" offset="11476323">They used the geophysical and geological and lease work of the majors in the like piggyback ride.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.955" offset="11511745">But what's more important, even if the smaller producers as a class did have demonstrably higher cost which they don't, it wouldn't materially aid them to set a separate higher price for their gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.229" offset="11576842">The reason for this is clear, even assuming that you could establish different prices for the same type of gas, nearly on the basis of the size of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.486" offset="11625848">The pipelines would not and should not buy gas for more money when there's gas for less money available in the same area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.320" offset="11665241">And the small producers recognized this dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.502" offset="11681959">They have not sought a higher separate price for themselves and they have not even asked for exemption entirely from area rates as various people including Justice Clark of this Court has suggested from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.123" offset="11748415">Instead, what they were asking is that the highest possible price for all gas so that they can ride along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.393" offset="11781538">A perfectly reasonable eye concept to what the real marketplace is here, the Commission was understandably, unwillingness -- unwilling to raise overall prices on this unproven claims of the small producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.387" offset="11841515">But they have done two important things for smaller producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.455" offset="11857816">In the first place, we have established a small producer certificate system which allows the producer to get out of the administrative burdens which are much more real for them than for the big company of continually filing with our Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.926" offset="11923644">Now they can get one certificate which is good for all of their sales and they can file up for increase as their contracts permit up to the ceiling, as we've said here without bothering to come to us with rate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.710" offset="11986756">The second place, we have, because we found it was not worth the price to do otherwise but also because it would benefit them, relieve them from observing the quality differentials that the Commission established on major permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.322" offset="12061257">Now, let me get to the problem that I -- that you asked before Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.146" offset="12080483">This quality question presented another major problem for the Commission acquiring innovation of some sort or another from itself is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.952" offset="12123742">Particularly in Permian, considerable percentage of the gas which the pipeline buy, more important, not what they buy, considerable percentage of the gas as it comes to the pipeline is not of pipeline quality and has to be processed by the pipelines at considerable expense for them and their consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.377" offset="12217469">There are a number of kinds of this deficiency which were set out in the record, high sulfur, too much water, too little pressure, and particular nasty thing in the Permian Basin, other gas comes out with a lot of CO2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.936" offset="12283716">And whereas the petroleum industry has shown tremendous ability to make use of all sorts of wastes and byproducts, so far, at least on this record, they haven't figured out what to do with CO2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.872" offset="12331468">This may come yet, but it hasn't come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.961" offset="12347768">And there's additional problem and that's the Btu problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.929" offset="12363651">Btu is the heating content of the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.948" offset="12375771">I think its British thermal units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.785" offset="12391131">Gas as it comes out of the round, depending on its molecular structure is of this different heating value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.025" offset="12424046">The Btu problem will come back to as a little different than these others because it goes both up and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.893" offset="12451527">Now, the producer said, don't worry about the quality problem, you can depend on the pipelines to bargain this down from any ceiling rates you set for bad quality gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.837" offset="12523311">And it certainly is evidenced that the pipelines in certain areas have paid less for low pressure gas which they had to compress to bring up to the level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.618" offset="12578377">But there's also evidence that this is far from the perfect system and the Commission was unwilling to do this while a lot of gas which has a low quality get the ceiling because there hadn't been such provisions and contracts and allow a higher in effect ceilings for bargaining in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.900" offset="12663536">What the Commission did was to treat the risk, a very real risk in the Permian Basin, of finding and developing gas of less than pipeline quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.998" offset="12739918">As one of the major elements which it relied upon in fixing the 12% rate of return which fixed not for average quality gas but as the return for finding pipeline quality gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.393" offset="12829571">In other words, it said, essentially the risk of finding low quality gas is analogist to the risk of finding no gas or the risk of finding gas in insufficient quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.877" offset="12891429">And we will consider it as one of the major elements in determining on a 12% rate of return on investment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.304" offset="12933120">The Court of Appeals in one stage of its opinion seems to have thought this was wrong, that the -- rather being treated as risk, we should treat as a producer cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.585" offset="12994247">We don't understand this because obviously this is not a producer cost, bad gas cost of producer, no more and no less than good gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.714" offset="13038759">And the gas we're talking about, the processing cost we're talking about here are the cost which the pipelines have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.971" offset="13075853">There is producer of processing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.885" offset="13091527">Of course, there's producer processing of gas in Permian, but where the producers process the gas in Permian and then sell it, they get the pipeline quality ceiling price but without any discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.028" offset="13144085">Now, we don't suggest that the technique the Commission adopted for handling this difficult quality problem is necessarily the only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.210" offset="13188807">The examiner equally innovating had a different one in which he fixed the price for average gas and then had a -- what you call a gold standard, above that where higher quality gas and a compression technique for lower quality gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.096" offset="13272294">And the -- whereas this is far from -- perfected in the examiner's opinion, this a possible approach to the problem also.</text>

            <text syncTime="3641.672" offset="14566609">This is based on evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.347" offset="14577371">We've been accused of supporting this by post record filings of these quality statements of the actual amounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.412" offset="14653544">Then, we have referred to these filings which support the Commission's judgment based on the record of what the extent of the quality differential would be because it does show we were right and because we know that if the specific quality statements have shown that we were wrong by 2 or 3 cents and that this was a much more serious problem that the Commission had counted on in fixing the rate of return, that the producers quite properly would be back here saying, “You have to remand it, you've made a serious mistake even if there was a basis for you're making”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.753" offset="14814981">Let me say a quick word about the Btu problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.279" offset="14833058">This is heating content, and here you can have very low Btu and very high Btu and this is not only a natural phenomena, but much more important, it is feasible and economic for pipelines unless there's -- for producers unless there's a good reason to the contrary to extract the high Btu's which can be converted into bottled gas and sold as propane and butane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.458" offset="14945802">Now, traditionally in this area, there has been a downward Btu adjustment starting at 1000 Btu per cubic foot and the Commission adopted that in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.957" offset="15015811">Traditionally, there has been no upward Btu adjustment in this area, but traditionally, the average value of Btu value of the gas sold was about 1042 Btu at least, this were the best statistics we could get on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.581" offset="15102224">And this is not insignificant because particularly in this area, the pipelines sell to the California distributors on a thermal basis, high Btu gas, they don't just extract it for their own operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.395" offset="15161574">The Commission felt that significant and important here to provide an inducement to the producer not to extract the high Btu's before it got to the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.400" offset="15221551">And they provided for the first time, unique in this area for upward Btu.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.526" offset="15246002">They set the upward Btu in a 1050, an approximation of the average Btu in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.315" offset="15293231">The very simple reason that the -- if they were going to give a bonus or no bonus was ever before been given, they weren't going to give a bonus for people giving less valuable gas than they have been supplying without a bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.390" offset="15353522">The Court of Appeals couldn't understand this gap of figure that we had to -- apparently a figure that if we're going to have a Btu adjustment half a start downward or an upward from the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.873" offset="15399393">For the reasons I just state, I don't think this is true but if we had done that, as long as we would have set it somewhere at around 1042 or 1050 both upwards and downwards and that would not benefit the producers quite a bit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3890.044" offset="15560098">Now, maybe belatedly let me turn the basic legal challenges to the Commission's action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.834" offset="15587265">The Court in giving a green light to area rate making in the second Phillips case, as we already made clear or rather reiterated, that the Natural Gas Act does not impose any special method for fixing just and reasonable rates, and particularly that the individual company prudent investment costs of service technique which has become conventional in utility rate making since this Court decision in Hope is not the only perhaps to a reasonable end result in dealing with the industry like natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.075" offset="15752255">The essential difficulty when utilizing individual company costs and pricing natural gas were set out by the Commission in the second Phillips decision and are summarized in Justice Harlan's decision affirming the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.794" offset="15827174">In short, unlike a normal utility fixing a transportation or communications or heating and lighting service, prudent investment and gas exploration will have only a tangential relationship to the end product of what you will get at and maybe more important, the conversiveness equivalent grades of gas from producers with different cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.816" offset="15939187">Now, whether this results from efficiency or luck, whatever, will not and should not have different values in the marketplace, likewise are not going to play high prices to one producer and another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.861" offset="16019435">Even if as certainly is not the case in this industry, even if gas were sold on a cost or price competitive basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.756" offset="16070949">And the fact which I think measures -- mentioned in Phillips previously, that two or more producers with quite different cost frequently share the same well or the same lease, only is a further illustration of the absurdity of attempting to price on the individual cost basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.788" offset="16163109">There are other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.652" offset="16170527">As the Court pointed out, individual company pricing will penalize the person who takes the risk and reward the person who say – say for a fellow who follows after him because the risk taker will have less cost for buying leases on a property where they don't expect gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.121" offset="16252447">Then the fellow comes along later and buys on the periphery of a known gas reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.773" offset="16279092">And of course, the extremely grave administrative problems in fixing rates separately, even for the 45 major producers say nothing with the smaller producers is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.592" offset="16350354">The record in this case here fully confirms the validity of the Commission's original determination on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.899" offset="16391523">In fact it goes beyond this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.960" offset="16403749">It suggest that no pricing system based on individual producers cost will provide any real picture of even that producer's long-term cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.374" offset="16457456">As we have set forth in our brief, the cost for even of the largest of producers who might be expected because of the sheer magnitude of their operations to balance out very tremendously from year to year, and not only very tremendously from year to year but there's many pattern within any one producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.331" offset="16553273">Now on the contrary, the evidence on this record also indicates that for the industry as a whole, there are meaningful cross trends, reasonably three of this board swings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.375" offset="16597473">Thus, we've got to a situation here where you can really say that for almost any given producer, the average industry cost rather than any historical cross section of his own cost at a particular moment for several years will be a far more likely indication of what his probable cost are for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.169" offset="16696633">Of course true, that this group average experience will not be reflected by any individual company at any given moment but more in the long run to good years balancing bad years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.577" offset="16762253">But this is the true and accurate picture of this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.952" offset="16783778">And attempting to price individually would distort the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.509" offset="16813976">If you -- if a particular company's cost for a given year of what you have used, given a series of years which you've used as test years were high, higher than average and you set its prices on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.510" offset="16878028">Would be a very good chance that he'd be going into a low cost period that is high cost or because he had made investment which hadn't matured yet and that in fact would be setting a windfall price range.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.235" offset="16928914">At the same time, if you set -- if an individual company has low cost for a test period and you set his individual rates on this low cost, just as good a chance that he is about going to a high cost cycle and will be in trouble as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.405" offset="16997564">In short, group or area rate making not only makes sense to the industry as a whole in the consumers, but it makes more sense than anything else for the individual producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.108" offset="17052421">Now these tracks in our opinion alone would support the use of the area rate procedure in the absence of a congressional directive that we couldn't use but there's plenty of judicial pressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.247" offset="17116891">I've already referred to the Phillips case and the other decisions of this Court and the lower courts which have consistently indicated that an area rate proceeding might be an appropriate way for handling producer rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.398" offset="17185541">More important than this maybe, under a virtually identical statute, this Court has held involving the Packers &amp; Stockyards Act, this Court has held in the Tagg Brothers case at 280 F.2d – from 280 U.S. in the Acker and Corrick cases in 298 that you can have group price making under this type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.503" offset="17297972">And the F.C.C. has group price making in the international telegraph field under a similar type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.900" offset="17339559">And of course, the numerous federal and state statutes providing for group rate or price making in milk and coal, warehousing, insurance, and aviation, all indicates that there isn't any statutory or constitutional need to fix rates which are geared to individual company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.411" offset="17441541">Specifically, this is maybe the guts of the legal issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.569" offset="17466201">We don't believe there's any statutory or constitutional right for any claim that because average group cost will necessarily be higher than the cost of some of the members of the group at any given time and lower than the cost of others that high cost producers are entitled to rates to meet their so-called cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.263" offset="17560973">As I've indicated, everything in this record indicates that over the long run, most individual producers cost will fluctuate around the industry average, and that today's high cost producers will be tomorrow's low cost producers and vice versa.</text>

            <text syncTime="5604.721" offset="22418808">The fact of the matter is, although there are a lot of producers in any field and they compete among themselves for new leases that there isn't a type of price competition which will -- can be depended upon to protect the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.638" offset="22474501">On the contrary, the history of pricing in Permian is very much like the history of pricing in Southern Louisiana which lead this Court in CATCO to say something has to be done and the regulatory agency has to move in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.873" offset="22527478">The reasons for this aren't obscure, and as this Court pointed out in the El Paso Divestment case, the way this business operates is a pipeline will, in addition to its usual increments of gas, every once in a while, it's making a big new sale and needs a lot of gas quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.838" offset="22599262">Then it has to go to the producers in the particular area who have the gas, these are usually a few producers, they obviously can -- as the record here indicates, it can get the prices up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.033" offset="22644088">The history of this business is this quasi posted price business that I mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.766" offset="22663001">All other prices go up and with the escalations in the old contracts even the prices for flowing gas goes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.816" offset="22699259">When you add to this, the fact that one of the major pipelines in the Permian Basin and the one which broke the pipe -- the price line but good in 1960, the Transwestern Pipeline was at that time very largely owned by producers, and when you add the strange absence of serious participation in this case by the pipeline, you'll see what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.354" offset="22801345">I said I tell you why the pipelines didn't participate, a very simple answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.157" offset="22820571">The pipelines much more than one would -- might suspect can pass on a higher price as they get to their customers is particularly true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.839" offset="22867278">The residential consumer is always more or less of a captive customer who can't switch back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.872" offset="22891416">And particularly in this case where we're dealing with California where the industrial consumer also is dependent largely on gas, price competition does just not hold down the prices and the pipelines as a result relatively disinterested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.844" offset="22963304">The other argument with respect to don't use cost or rather if you use it, use it as a very minor factor is a little different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.698" offset="23006772">It goes on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.179" offset="23016699">There's too little gas being discovered to meet future needs and even under the Commission's pricing system we can't be sure that there's going to be enough gas discovered therefore don't use cost or anything else to really put much of a lid on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.477" offset="23093812">The fact that in every year, not only through this record, but since this time, reserves at it have been more in production and the fact that in Permian, since the Commission in 1960 put a guideline price on which is about the same as the new gas-well pipes, have been tremendous development, is discounted and what this type of argument talks about is the declining reserves to production ratio nationally, the RP ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.038" offset="23228082">This has been going down, it certainly has, it was about 32 to 1 at a time when gas was a waste product and it has been going down steadily ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.499" offset="23261936">Slower but still steadily and it's now about 16.5 to 1 and may go down through.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.765" offset="23318988">The Commission recognized this and so it wasn't disturbed by this, that it was far from clear that the present ratios are not too high in the sense of -- in the economy and the consumer standpoint requiring present consumers to pay for too much gas for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.623" offset="23406446">The oil industry which is certainly not comparable in all respects, the RP ratio there is leveled off at about 11 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.041" offset="23448137">And far from clear that something similar to this wouldn't be equally good in the gas industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.756" offset="23487007">The Commission hasn't ignored this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5874.598" offset="23498292">The Commission in fact added one cent to the E and D allowance to provide for exploration and development greater than the current figure in order to provide for further advancement in exploration and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.968" offset="23575824">Let me be clear about this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.316" offset="23585228">We're fully aware of our -- that our obligations to the gas consumers and we think that is to fix prices at the lowest possible level consistent with a healthy industry and reasonable profits to the producers, cannot be met by ignoring the long-term interplay of the factors of supply and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.549" offset="23674149">We shall and must continue to watch current and future trends on the production side and to the extent that price can play a positive role area, be prepared to adjust prices for future vantages of gas to meet current conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.194" offset="23740709">But on this point, let me read from the decision of this Court in the Hope case, in response to a similar claim by the State of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.579" offset="23778220">We have set production cost there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.443" offset="23789714">Tends to be cost for the individual pipeline but the point is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5951.192" offset="23804761">At too low a level to insure there'd be adequate production.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.957" offset="23823778">And what Justice Douglas said in that case and we thinks it's completely applicable here is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.010" offset="23851990">I'm reading from 320 U.S. at 615, if in the light of experience, they, that is the rates, turn out to be inadequate for the development of new sources of supply, the doors of the Commission are open for increased allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.654" offset="23918550">This is not an order for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.067" offset="23932238">This is equally applicable here, and the 16 and a half to 1 RP ratio, that means, there is proven reserves, admittedly understated as to the actual reserves, but proven reserves 16 and a half times the present production is more than adequate to provide lead time if this in this year shows that something should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.522" offset="24034011">Now, let me turn to our third group of producer arguments who accept as at least within our discretion reluctantly, tying cost -- tying rates to cost yardsticks.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.571" offset="24098273">That they argue and here they're joined by the Court of Appeals that the Commission, either by fixing minimum as well as maximum rates or by raising the maximum rates, has to ensure that producers as a group will recover revenues equal to their average costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.242" offset="24188865">And the edge -- alleged failure of the Commission to make this assurance was certainly one of the main grounds of the Court of Appeals' decision remanding it to us because the Court said that this is contrary to the end result test in Hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.825" offset="24263262">It will also form this Court's basis on rehearing for saying that the refunds cannot be made even on increased rates which are above the just and reasonable ceiling we have set here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.802" offset="24319164">Unless we first find out they're not offset by lower rates which some of the producers are voluntarily agreed to in their context.</text>
            <text syncTime="6090.384" offset="24361482">The Court of Appeals construed this end result test of Hope to requiring a balancing of cost with expected revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.400" offset="24405577">It reversed the Commission because it did not specify the total revenues which the producers would secure on the established rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.243" offset="24436924">If you remember Justice Stewart, the same argument was made last year in the Chicago Northwestern Division case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.860" offset="24463360">And also because the revenues would necessarily not equal cost average cost to the extent that contractual limitations precluded producers from filing from appropriate ceilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.673" offset="24530651">The Commission in response to this letter claimed expressly denied its intent to match jurisdictional revenues with jurisdiction cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.414" offset="24573597">And what it said was, and I'm reading from our record 1114D, it would be contrary to all regulatory principles to permit prices in excess of a just and reasonable rate for certain purchases merely because other sales have been voluntarily made below costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.016" offset="24660010">But the Commission went on to make clear that there was no basis for believing that overall producer revenues would be inadequate for the maintenance of the healthy industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.279" offset="24705045">Now the Court of Appeals was dissatisfied with this latter conclusion because it felt that the failure, I'm quoting from the Court, the failure of the record to disclose the revenue impact of the adjustments in the area rates to reflect quality differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.728" offset="24774844">As I've already indicated but I'll expand upon a little bit here, that this is just plain wrong, it overlooks the finding of the Commission on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.854" offset="24811416">Now, let me explain this problem and I think the Court was confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="6207.805" offset="24831164">There isn't any evidence in the record and we don't pretend there is as to the pipeline cost at their processing plants of bringing the gas up to pipeline quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.189" offset="24884663">And therefore, since the Commission was establishing the system of matching the individual sale to its quality, it was necessary to provide for a special procedure of quality statements filed by the producers at the consultation with the pipelines with respect to the particular discount for the particular sale as a result of the particular processing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.721" offset="24990824">But there was evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.847" offset="24999288">There was considerable evidence in the record of the approximate overall impact of the quality reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.113" offset="25032411">What was this evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.351" offset="25041398">First of all, there was evidence based upon producer cost in their processing claim of performing the same functions of bringing gas up to the pipeline quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.559" offset="25086224">Secondly, there was an evidence of certain contractual provisions and some of the contracts where pipelines expressly provided for their -- they should be reimbursed where they had to bring gas up to pipeline quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6287.024" offset="25148082">And third, there was expert testimony based on these facts as to what the impact would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.286" offset="25177130">This wasn't something the Commission invented.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.018" offset="25187997">The examiner -- it's -- in his decision had quantified this that about 1 to 1 and a half cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.442" offset="25217672">The concurring Commissioner said 1 to 1.7 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.545" offset="25238152">And the Commission in the light of certain adjustments to quality which it made that the producers' behest on rehearing found that the range of this quantity discount would be .7% to 1.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.444" offset="25305757">And what they found on the basis of the record actually squares with these quality statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6332.970" offset="25331879">There is thus no, if I may use the term the Court used, there is no revenue deficiency.The question at all is with respect to quality adjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.549" offset="25374093">The producers aren't going to receive the ceiling price which we have set for pipeline quality gas for the large percentage of Permian gas which is far from pipeline quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.510" offset="25421949">But this was exactly what the Commission anticipated whether it adopted a rate of return, deliberately set to take into account the quantified risk that Permian gas would not qualify for ceiling prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.466" offset="25485793">Now let me get back to the other aspect of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.831" offset="25503242">This relates to contract pricings made by various producers over various periods of time by which they agreed in selling gas to the various pipeline at the maximum price they could charge at a given moment was X and X may, and is in certain areas, less than we have found the maximum they could have charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.583" offset="25622256">The Court of Appeals originally seems to have believed that we were under an obligation to take care of these contracts by setting minimum rates which would aviate the overall impact of these limitations on filing up to the area of ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.339" offset="25713267">Now rehearing, it seems to have also suggested that maybe instead of setting minimum rates, we could simply set the base rate higher, similarly to negate the effect of these contractual limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6445.926" offset="25783693">But while it isn't entirely clear what the Court of Appeals said we should do, as far as we're concerned, the Court of Appeals is one of either respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.768" offset="25827056">Now, what is the basis, the legal basis for this position?</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.323" offset="25849208">Essentially, we go back to this Court's decision in the Mobil and the Sierra Pacific cases at 350 U.S. -- at 332 and 348.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.690" offset="25902707">Now, the point of these cases which of course billed on earlier cases in the railroad and natural gas fields, state natural gas law field, the point of these cases is that regulation under the Natural Gas Act does not automatically supersede freely made contracts between buyer and seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.769" offset="25999047">Contractual limitations, not only cannot be circumvented by the sellers filing a rate increase, under Section 4 of the Act, that's the Mobil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6511.802" offset="26047112">But as Justice Harlan made clear in the Sierra Pacific, the Commission itself cannot and shouldn't raise a rate which by contrary, the seller in this industry has set at a lower figure than he could have charged merely in order to enable that seller to return -- earn the full return that would have been permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6540.292" offset="26161110">What Justice Harlan said there, the test he said we had to apply and the test we're – or if you're willing to apply here too is that before somebody volunt -- before somebody who has voluntarily agreed to a lower rate to perform this service, that he might have been entitled in this range of what's in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.975" offset="26275840">It must be demonstrated and here I am quoting, “That the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest”, as where it might impair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service, passed on other consumers in excessive burden or be unduly discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6589.680" offset="26358700">And nothing is in the Sierra case as we read suggest that the decision rest on the assumption that the company involved could -- without a similar public interest showing, charged rates on other sense higher than otherwise would be appropriate on these sales simply to make up for the loss in maximum profits who doesn't voluntarily agree to bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6618.638" offset="26474475">On the contrary, the Natural Gas Act which we were construing here today, expressly states and I'm quoting from Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act that all rates and charges of a natural gas company must be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.783" offset="26539050">And that any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6642.537" offset="26570083">And this Court in the Tennessee case, at 371 U.S. similarly made clear that losses in the first instance do not justify illegal gains in the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="6884.410" offset="27537554">As far as the producer is concerned, renegotiation is appropriate and it was renegotiated, that were fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6890.846" offset="27563363">We're talking about the situation where the pipelines were unwilling to renegotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.650" offset="27578514">They want to stick with their bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.033" offset="27588127">Let me explain what the problem is, it's very, very clear in Permian.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.119" offset="27612473">A lot of the very low rates here are the result of the bargains made by Northern Natural Gas Company with some producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6911.508" offset="27646015">Now, Northern has got the benefit of these bargains, and this is going to benefit its customers in the Midwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6918.918" offset="27675585">A lot of the higher rates which were subject to refunds here, subject to reduction of the result of El Paso agreeing to high charges in part to get rid of some of these escalations that we mentioned in its raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.857" offset="27747370">Now, maybe Northern is going to allow that the goodness of its heart because it's so important to it, agree to allow these rates to be raised, but the problem really is El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="6952.913" offset="27811631">El Paso's customers have been paying these rates which we found to be too high, and the question is whether they should get any relief for it, both from the area of reductions for the future and in refunds for the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="6973.192" offset="27892715">Don't get me wrong, we believe that the Sierra test is applicable and if somebody can show that these low contract rates are in fact inhibiting the industry from performing its functions, not only to itself but to its customers then obviously there is justification under – that's it the appropriate tests for raising these low contract rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6997.312" offset="27989159">But, there hasn't been any such showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7001.637" offset="28006504">With respect to the new gas-well gas, the gas -- the prices we've set for new gas-well gas for the future perfectly clear that there can't be – there's some showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.188" offset="28056660">They're under no contractual innovations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7017.269" offset="28068989">We haven't set any.</text>
            <text syncTime="7018.221" offset="28072856">They can contract for the area rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.501" offset="28085917">It's conceivable as some of the producers point out that despite these innovations, various sales will in the future go for less than the area rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.404" offset="28125518">But certainly this is not the basis for our fixing the new gas-well rate at some arbitrary higher figure to take care of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7042.683" offset="28170658">With respect to the old gas-well gas rate and the oil-well gas which is tied to this, the continuing operations here are -- as I've indicated before, basically a relationship of the continuing production cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="7062.981" offset="28251847">And we don't see how anybody is going to make any showing, certainly not on the group basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="7070.909" offset="28283611">Certainly not of the group basis that if these rates are not raised and they continue to have to get what they contracted for here that this industry is going to be adversely affected from the public interest in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7085.815" offset="28343171">Now, let me make a very strong caveat, I don't think the industry can come close to making a Sierra type point and they certainly haven't made it on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7103.080" offset="28412238">I can conceive money.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.402" offset="28421538">Individual producers with high embedded cost or other special problems who could make the Sierra form.</text>
            <text syncTime="7114.638" offset="28458527">I can conceive of an individual producer who is in the problem that Justice Fortas mentioned before who's got an unprofitable sale which is not in the public interest to allow to be abandoned, I believe they're on that sale or another sale has a contractual limitation coming in and saying, “This is good justification for allowing me to raise the contractual limitation here”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7142.316" offset="28569182">And we do think it's possible that there will be on an individual basis pursuant for the special exception procedure, individual showings as to why some are all -- low contract rate should be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="7158.446" offset="28633757">But we don't think this is a general matter and we don't think it's anything that requires as the Court did a remand to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7168.312" offset="28673149">And what I have said here is at least in our opinion equally applicable to the refund situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="7437.234" offset="29748872">The Court of Appeals originally believed as we think rightly that refunds of rates which these people have been allowed under the Act, to put into effect and charge only upon the agreement that they would pay back to their customers if they were found to be high -- have to be on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="7461.538" offset="29846152">The Court was persuaded on rehearing that this Court's decision in the second Phillips case, the Wisconsin case, precluded that termination and that there had to be a more general balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7477.150" offset="29908532">Now this is a misreading of Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="7479.950" offset="29919713">Briefly what happens in Phillips was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7481.804" offset="29927131">If you remember, we started out to fix Phillips rates for all its sales throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7487.619" offset="29950433">Some of these sales were much higher and some of them are much lower than the average -- and the average cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="7494.885" offset="29979481">This isn't surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="7496.188" offset="29984705">There sales involved there were not only in Permian, there is Hugoton-Anadarko which is the oldest and shallowest field in the Unites States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7503.583" offset="30014276">There were in Southern Louisiana, they're all over the continent.</text>
            <text syncTime="7507.018" offset="30028069">The Commission didn't finish that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="7508.718" offset="30034860">It never got the rate design part of the Phillips case in which it went through the exercise of determining whether some of these high sales were or were not in the light of the particular circumstances too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="7526.085" offset="30104242">And therefore, there was no presumption that they were above a just and reasonable standard in their area merely because they were higher than the Phillips cost statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7539.523" offset="30158054">What the Commission did was, they said, “We're not going to go through this exercise and with respect to the 10(4) (e) increased rate filings we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="7551.044" offset="30204134">It isn't worth our time or anybody's time to make these allocations at this stage of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="7559.108" offset="30236421">And the Court in affirming us, made very clear that it was limiting us to the particular facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7566.855" offset="30267350">Justice Harlan's decision noted that we had in the subsequent case said that a high rate isn't necessarily justified merely because the comparison of overall costs and overall revenues were balanced out.</text>
            <text syncTime="7584.698" offset="30338717">But Justice Harlan pointed out that in that case, the rate wasn't locked in as it was in Phillips and as they are not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7594.665" offset="30378632">And he also pointed out that in that case, in the Hunt case, this rate was higher than that area's average, analogous to the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7606.131" offset="30424503">And he distinguished the Phillips situation on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="7610.683" offset="30442684">And we think that this is all what Phillips really stands for that in the particular circumstances of that particular case, it was justifiable for the Commission as was said, it wasn't going to go ahead generally with this allocation to refuse to make it for these 10 sales on the off chance that a few of the high sales might turn out to be more than just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7636.742" offset="30546965">Certainly, that's not the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7641.104" offset="30564415">In the brief time, before I have to sit down I would like to say one more word.</text>
            <text syncTime="7648.748" offset="30594926">The Commission has done another innovative thing in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="7653.564" offset="30614256">At least it's innovative as far as the Federal Power Commission is concerned, and that is the establishment of a moratorium on any increased sales for a discrete period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7669.811" offset="30679144">The Commission in excess of precaution because this was the first case, because of the nature of area rate making at this stage, limited this moratorium to a two-year period that would expire on January 1st, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="7685.252" offset="30741002">But this is an important question for future cases and this is by no means moot because there are a number of sales increased during this moratorium period.</text>

            <text syncTime="7781.970" offset="31127824">And the point I -- the only point I want to make is that not only that this has been allowed for our Commission by the certificate authority of Section 7, but we think that it is equally permissible under the provision of Section 5 of the Act and that's what we're dealing with which provides that the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate to be thereafter observed and enforced and to fix the same by order.</text>
            <text syncTime="7809.266" offset="31237016">This is exactly the same language which this Court found over 20 years ago in the U.S. v. Corrick case at 298 justified the Secretary of Agriculture in refusing to consider rate increase filings filed under an identical statute in Section 4 of our Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7833.134" offset="31332519">And the Court pointed out that when the Commission, in a rate case of this nature, not merely responds to allowing company made rates to go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7843.908" offset="31375569">But where the Commission has done the legislative job that under this type of language, the Commission's action in effect, Justice Harlan, takes the place of contractual limitations on Section 4 that we were talking about in the Mobil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7862.968" offset="31451847">And we think that the same situation here certainly justified on the record on this proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="7891.998" offset="31567935">The people of the State of California, the California Public Utilities Commission, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego appear before this Court to urge that it affirm the Commission's decision in this case in its entirety, whether by design or accident when the Commission shows the Permian Basin area of West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico to initiate this pilot pioneering case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7925.137" offset="31700532">It involved California very deeply because as you have been informed on the basis of the test year volumes, approximately 85% of the gas produced in the Basin is consumed in the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7942.887" offset="31771481">The volumes sold from the Permian Basin have increased subsequently and my best information now is that the volumes are larger, but that we consume some 77% of the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="7959.031" offset="31836056">In appearing before this Court, we rep -- we feel we represent the consumer interest and we hope that we can give some perspective to your evaluation of the decision through looking at it from the point of view of the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7979.505" offset="31917976">That the consumer interest is important especially in California, I think it is shown by the fact that we lack economical alternative sources of energy, not only for residential space heating and the like but also for the generation of electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="7996.433" offset="31985685">Also, we have a very severe air pollution problem in California which I'm sure the Court is familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="8003.667" offset="32014629">Therefore, it's very important to the economic wellbeing of California that we obtain natural gas at the lowest reasonable rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="8021.813" offset="32087249">Yes sir, we do and the -- I think that the statistic show that for residential purposes and they are truly the captive customers, most of the appliances especially for space heating are gas burning appliances meaning that once the consumer has made an election to use that kind of fuel, the price would have to go very high indeed in order to justify as discontinuing the use of his durable good type appliance and switching to something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="8054.720" offset="32218802">However, industrially speaking, under the interruptible rate schedules Mr. Justice Stewart, there are alternative uses or rather facilities for the use of oil in steam generation plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="8071.360" offset="32285362">But there is a drawback to that because the oil, unless it's a very special low salt or bearing type, does create air pollution problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="8082.891" offset="32331546">Therefore the City of Los Angeles, through it's Air Pollution Control District has a rule that the distributing -- or rather that the steam generation plants in the -- in Los Angeles County burn natural gas to the extent that it is available.</text>

            <text syncTime="8131.402" offset="32525584">And I certainly agree with you sir that in participating in this case, we have realized that our job is not completely parochial and that our responses to the problem suppose in this case do have a certain national importance insofar as the decision in this case may stand for precedent for the future development of area rate making.</text>
            <text syncTime="8155.852" offset="32623386">As this Court well knows, consumer protection is the primary aim of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8162.797" offset="32651180">In fact, in the Atlantic Refining Company against Public Service Commission of New York, the Court referred to the Natural Gas Act by indicating that it was framed to provide consumers a complete, permanent and effective of bond of protection from excessive rates and charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="8183.970" offset="32735817">Certainly, this has been the kind of bond that has taken a very long time indeed to mature.</text>
            <text syncTime="8190.527" offset="32762044">We have waited some 11 years for a decision from the Federal Power Commission fixing just and reasonable rates for independent producers in measuring that period of time between this Court's decision in Phillips Petroleum Company against Wisconsin until the issuance of Opinion 468 which is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8214.032" offset="32856085">And of course, the rest of the time has elapsed going to the necessity for judicial review and I would point out that the rate reduction portions of the Commission's order, they have been stayed by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="8231.924" offset="32927660">And the Commission itself stayed the operation of the refund portion of its order in this case, so that as we appear before the Court right now, there's still no relief in terms of the impact of just and reasonable rates insofar as consumers are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="8259.361" offset="33037375">Despite all that, or ready enough in -- not in spite of it but we feel as though certainly the time has come that the solution ought to be before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="8277.192" offset="33108741">And we asked that the Court affirm the Commission's decision in its entirety because for the first time, an effective and administratively feasible system of regulation of independent producers has been created.</text>
            <text syncTime="8293.705" offset="33174779">For the first time, just and reasonable rates both in terms of Section 4 and Section 5 of the Act had been established by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="8302.957" offset="33211768">And we think this is important too for the first time, all the thickets and tangles involved with the suspect price doctrine and inline pricing with which I'm sure that the Court is familiar, that too will be a disappearing thing, because the Commission has indicated that it expects to apply the just and reasonable rates determined in the area to newly certificated sales of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="8332.527" offset="33330051">Now, there's one thing I would like to correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="8335.096" offset="33340291">In developing the case below that a -- within the Commission, we did support the two-price system.</text>
            <text syncTime="8343.665" offset="33374563">In fact, we went along the little different route from some of the other economist who made presentations, California was the only party to present, for the examiner's consideration a -- an estimated cost of new non-associated gas-well gas which was based on area cost as opposed to national cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="8372.190" offset="33488666">Our thought being that the purpose behind area rate making was to the extent possible to focus on the cost experience within that area so that the cost of the gas could be determined for the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="8387.223" offset="33548852">The presiding examiner rejected our showing in that regard because he felt that it would -- that it relied too much on allocations which he felt were not reliable basis for decision when one is attempting to find an economic cost of gas for the future which the cost of the new gas-well gas is.</text>

            <text syncTime="8424.161" offset="33696601">It shows a lower cost although to be fair about it, I must indicate that the rate of return of which California relied on was that which was advanced by the staff, by its witness Dr. Shaffner of 9 and a half percent whereas the Commission and the presiding examiner chose 12%.</text>
            <text syncTime="8452.787" offset="33811122">It was mentioned by general counsel for the Commission at the beginning of the -- of his argument as to the plight in which we found ourselves when this Court handed down its decision in the second Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="8471.886" offset="33887504">It is true, I think as Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court shows that within -- the closest to advocating that the individual company cost to service method was the only method which the Commission ought to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="8492.106" offset="33968379">Just to amplify that a little bit, first of all, we're not here to reargue second Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="8501.356" offset="34005368">Our disappointment in the result there was that we were very much afraid that the development of area rate making might cast itself lose entirely from any kind of attention to costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8517.674" offset="34070674">Our concern was not so much that the rates would be predicated on individual company experience as that the rates would not be predicated on costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8531.896" offset="34127517">That the thinking of the language in City of Detroit that we would free ourselves completely of the anchor and discard all of the experience under the Act as we ventured into this rather uncharted at that time problem of devising area rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8550.886" offset="34203481">And when that case was argued before this Court, there had been some reason to believe this that when we went to Midland in 1961, one of the producers, in fact was a large group of major producers, offered the Commission a motion which indicated that no individual company cost of service data would be allowed in the case as admissible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="8581.446" offset="34325734">Not only that, but no group of cost to service would be allowed in, only cost data.</text>
            <text syncTime="8591.787" offset="34367112">Now, that's a peculiar distinction, what's the difference between cost data and cost of the service data.</text>
            <text syncTime="8600.449" offset="34401698">Well, I suggest although I'm not sure yet, I suggest that the difference is that you take the raw cost trending data but you don't match it up with respect to the gas that is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="8615.336" offset="34461257">And we thought that it was the means whereby no evaluation of the profitability of the rates could be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="8627.350" offset="34509322">It was not until 1962, in fact, May 14 of 1962 that pursuant to our motion, the Commission reversed its order of April 5, 1961 barring all costs of service presentations of any type or nature from the case and said that upon further consideration of the matter, they might be of some usefulness and we'll let them into the record for whatever use they may provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="8660.294" offset="34641084">And I think that that might give the Court some perspective as to the long journey which California consumers travel through this case to reach any kind of cost based area rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8677.578" offset="34710256">After that, the staff of the Federal Power Commission put in complete cost of service presentations with respect to the categories of the gas and we rely very heavily upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8696.892" offset="34787474">Now just why is it that we are so concerned about costs?</text>
            <text syncTime="8702.556" offset="34810149">Is this just some sort of fixation?</text>
            <text syncTime="8705.322" offset="34821224">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="8707.359" offset="34829375">From the consumer point of view, we think that the alternative are notions of market value that mark that value and we are convinced speaking for consumers that we are not dealing with a situation wherein competition has proved effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="8728.075" offset="34912235">The Commission has so found in this decision and the Court of Appeals has approved that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="8736.553" offset="34946194">However, I don't think we should lose sight of it from the consumer point of view in looking at the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="8747.974" offset="34991856">And that of course comes back again to what I said that in large measure, gas consumers do not have a choice insofar, as their costs have passed on to the interstate pipeline companies, they are in turn passed on to the locally regulated California distributors in this case PG&amp;E, Pacific Lighting Companies and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="8771.105" offset="35084330">They finally end up in a little brown envelop which is delivered to the customer and are paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="8779.676" offset="35118602">They can't be argued about consumers rely in the first instance upon the Federal Power Commission and in the second instance in our situation in the California Public Utilities Commission for protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="8793.304" offset="35173146">They cannot delegate this function to huge interstate pipeline companies to bargain effectively for them, for we are convinced that if the pipeline company is in the position to pass on these costs, their incentive to bargain is -- at least it is fair to say diminished to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="8816.812" offset="35267187">They don't have a buyer who can say, “I don't want it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="8822.691" offset="35290697">Now the Commission to our great -- the Commission has used cost in this case and this is of course we think very important and permits us to come before this Court today and asked that this be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8852.846" offset="35411383">The Commission has said that cost provides an objective price standard based on cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="8860.753" offset="35442939">They said the cost is the bedrock of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="8863.825" offset="35455269">And in another instance it said that it is the nature ingredient of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="8869.157" offset="35476584">Now, let us be clear about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="8871.422" offset="35485675">It is a cost based decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="8875.020" offset="35499990">It is not entirely based on costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8878.825" offset="35515246">Its cost based to the extent that new gas-well gas which is gas produced not in association with oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="8889.762" offset="35559027">And old gas-well gas, those prices are based on cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="8896.810" offset="35587239">However, it's -- it has been pointed out to you, 66% of the gas sold in the Permian Basin area is oil-well gas, it's not the gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="8911.314" offset="35645231">And the Commission has said because of its disinclination toward making allocations, (Inaudible) myself by saying that we've never really agreed with that point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="8924.646" offset="35698521">We think that allocations can be made by rational men and that it isn't necessary just because joint costs are involved simply to refuse to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8935.873" offset="35743451">But we're not here to quarrel about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8937.881" offset="35751497">But apparently is the view of the Commission that it is to be avoided wherever possible and that is what they've done, but they priced most of the gas which is going to be sold on the basis of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="8954.398" offset="35817535">Well, some interesting questions arise there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8958.990" offset="35835925">One wonders whether or not that would not have been an abuse of discretion if the Commission had had no idea whatever as to what casinghead and residue gas costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8970.748" offset="35882945">Would it have been an appropriate exercise of their administrative responsibilities under the Act to have simply priced most of the gas at the gas-well gas price but the Commission was not fully unaware as to what the cost of oil-well gas was.</text>
            <text syncTime="8991.872" offset="35967478">The staff had made a full presentation on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8995.400" offset="35981584">All of the parties, California and the California distributors took the point of view that the gas should be historically caused it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9008.806" offset="36035187">So that -- we're not too concerned within the framework of this particular decision that the value has been misused, we think that, as the Commission itself recognizes, the oil-well gas does in fact costs less even using the same rate of return and not changing any of the comparisons than gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="9039.449" offset="36157753">And we would recommend or invite the attention of the Court to that section of the Commission's opinion on rehearing, 468-a beginning I believe at 1112D called revenues versus costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="9059.609" offset="36238420">There, the Commission was addressing itself to be problem which apparently concerned most greatly the Court of Appeals and that is the argument that costs do not -- rather that revenues do not balance cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="9077.849" offset="36311353">And the Commission was fully aware of this argument and gave consideration there to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9084.980" offset="36339879">And I would like if I may to go through some of the observations that the Commission made and as a prelude to that to point to the Court, that with each one of these observations, I think it should be realized that consumers had been made to pay a price that these are matters which go against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="9115.205" offset="36460774">The Commission first of all pointed out that exploration and development costs were allowed at 4.08 cents even though in its judgment, the oil-well gas was found as a byproduct of the search for -- for the search for oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="9136.038" offset="36544052">Now, that there'd be no misunderstanding of this, that 4.08 cents does have within it, when you look at the cost -- at the yardstick, the old gas-well gas cost, it is an allocated cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="9152.581" offset="36610299">The condensate which is separated at the least does bear a part of this E and D cost that is being reflected over to the old flowing oil-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="9180.633" offset="36722521">And furthermore, the Commission reversed the examiner or refused to accept his recommendation with respect to the Spraberry contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="9191.831" offset="36767242">These are contracts for the sale of residue gas flowing oil-well residue gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="9199.232" offset="36796918">The plants are owned by El Paso Natural Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="9203.646" offset="36814576">And the contractual arrangement between it and the producers is such that the producer is paid for the gas at the well-gas -- however the price that is paid to him is figured at the tailgate of the plant after the natural gasoline has been extracted which we think is one of the primary purposes of directing those plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="9230.769" offset="36923037">Moreover, there is a division or percentage of the liquid revenues which are a part -- part as retained by El Paso and part is given back to the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="9245.570" offset="36982178">Now, the Commission decided that this contract was a useful mechanism in the industry and permitted it to remain as such and rationalized the result in the ground that there was no showing in the record that El Paso did not retain sufficient of the liquid revenues to offset it's costs of running the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="9269.442" offset="37077682">I suggest by the converse that there was no evidence in the record that the contrary is not true and if it is not true, then consumers are going to pay a higher price for that residue gas in the Spraberry contracts than otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="9288.130" offset="37152496">The truth to the -- the reason that we say that is that El Paso is under the ordinary approach that the Commission takes in pipeline cases are -- El Paso is required to credit its revenue from those liquid sales to its cost to service in determining our pipeline rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="9312.296" offset="37249149">So that we don't end up paying all of the costs of the plant and not get any credit whatever for some of the revenues which had been enjoyed by El Paso as the result of those costs inputs in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="9325.828" offset="37303275">Our problem has always been that we've been unable to get a cost for the plant operations in order to determine whether El Paso does make out all right on the amount of the liquid revenues which it attains or whether it goes in the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="9344.932" offset="37379657">If it goes in the whole, we're going to pay the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="9348.623" offset="37394390">But rather, the Commission turned its attention to what would happen to the -- it turned its attention to the Commission, or rather to the pipeline and said that, “Well, if this isn't going to be satisfactory, well, we would expect you to renegotiate with the producer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="9371.054" offset="37484147">I have already indicated at least our -- less than our faith in the motivation that the pipeline company refused to undertake those negotiations especially in view that they can pass on costs to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="9397.759" offset="37590936">There's one other item too which is right in the same thing and that is that the Commission in this discussion points out that in constructing its yardstick for old gas-well gas, they did not include a plant liquid credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9415.196" offset="37660735">Now, such a credit was included in making the new gas-well gas cost study.</text>
            <text syncTime="9424.165" offset="37696575">It was not included in the old gas-well gas and it is the yardstick that is applied to this huge resort of gas which is sold in the Permian Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="9434.633" offset="37738475">The distinction there is that although the -- there's an allocation of the cost to take care of the revenues and liquids which are separated at the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="9448.590" offset="37794273">There was an old allocation of the plant costs because the plant cost were not even figured in the basic cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="9456.667" offset="37826664">However, the -- if you're going to strip the gas beyond the least and extract even more liquids from it, then it would appear and this is all that we think that the Commission was saying that that those revenues should also be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="9477.997" offset="37911928">I should like now to move on to what I would call the basic finding of this case and you'll find it in paragraph 4 of the further findings of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="9489.963" offset="37959784">That's at 687(d) when it says that -- when the Commission says that the just and reasonable rates for past, present and for post sales of natural gas to which this order applies are the applicable area rates set forth in ordering paragraphs (a) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="9508.029" offset="38032091">That means that these applicable area rates should perform three functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9514.564" offset="38058214">Prospectively, under 5(a) they are the just and reasonable rates to be here after observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="9520.046" offset="38080157">Under 4 (e) they are the just and reasonable rates which have to be applied to the rate schedules to calculate refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="9527.841" offset="38111295">And as I mentioned earlier, they would replace the concept of in lineness which is presently necessary because there is no just and reasonable rate at least on such -- until such time as this decision is affirmed and we hope it will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="9546.834" offset="38187259">Turning to the refunds, our concept of refunds is that is -- that is merely a derived calculation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9556.160" offset="38224562">Section 4 (e) states that all the rates of the natural gas company must be just and reasonable and if they're not just and reasonable, they're unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="9564.998" offset="38259984">That's a very, very simple straightforward statement we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="9569.379" offset="38277433">And what we think that means is that once you've determined what the just and reasonable rate is, you look at the total amount of money that was collected subject to refund by the Natural Gas Company and that excess must be refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="9583.436" offset="38333649">The converse of corollary of this is, that if you do not do so, then you must really be finding by implication at least that the -- that to the extent that you do not require the full refund of -- the whole refund, the distance between the amount collected subject to refund and the just and reasonable rate, if you don't do that, then what -- what we argue is that you must have raised the just and reasonable rate by implication.</text>

            <text syncTime="9902.441" offset="39609678">Yes, well, I don't have a calculation of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="9905.981" offset="39623889">But and so there really would be no point in my trying to make a guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="9910.761" offset="39643011">I'm not quite sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="9911.989" offset="39647922">I will say that when we did receive about a $136 million in refunds which were actually available for distribution to California customers that figure comes to my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="9924.995" offset="39699958">The refunds among residential customers ranged all the way from -- as I recall from 06 even up to $10.</text>
            <text syncTime="9935.426" offset="39741649">So that would give you some kind of a – although, you can get it all figured out, I just don't -- I have not meet the calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9951.248" offset="39804970">Before leaving the refund part of the argument, this Court has observed that re -- that the refund protection Section 4 (e) is a very disadvantageous kind of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="9969.550" offset="39878113">We don't use this kind of relief under the Public Utilities Code in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="9973.514" offset="39893995">We used a different system which does not involve refunding and we think that in your deliberations on the refund question that if anything, it must provide a sanction against filing unwarranted increased rates because to the extent that that can happen, they just borrow the consumers' money.</text>
            <text syncTime="10000.177" offset="40000679">And that if we read the refund section out of the Act to this area refund concept adopted on rehearing by the Court of Appeals, then as we observed in our brief, the sanction of individuals making up their own minds will sound as in the judgment as to whether or not an increased rate can be justified is certainly reduced, because once again, the consumers are at the end of the line when it comes to the refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="10038.568" offset="40154175">We don't think there should be any trouble at all in the Commission's observation that the just and reasonable price should become the inline price in future cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="10052.171" offset="40208614">And I'd like to turn now to the notion that we're dealing here with just a limited remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="10061.571" offset="40246230">If we go down to the Power Commission again, if you take into account the fact that the Power Commission in it's decision has indicated that there's a certain degree of generosity in the determinations that they had made on the value basis and if we are going to reexamine as the Court of Appeals would have as do, the 12% rate of return which was expressly made that high in order to protect the producers from quality deduction that the Court keep in mind if it would that this entire Opinion 468 in our judgment at least is an interdependent package.</text>
            <text syncTime="10108.668" offset="40434625">There are many considerations which have to be looked at from the point of view of the entire decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="10118.020" offset="40472033">It is not the kind of thing that ought to be changed just on a piecemeal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="10126.331" offset="40505260">There is a severe danger I think that consumer interest who have decided that it is in the interest of consumers to support this decision that they go back only for corrections the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="10139.777" offset="40559073">I would point out to the Court that we file a petition for rehearing before the Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="10143.842" offset="40575269">We objected to this 12% rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="10146.669" offset="40586658">We objected to a minimum rate of 9 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="10151.348" offset="40605362">And we objected to a dividing date between new and old gas of the -- of January 1, 1961 because the very basis for having the two-price system is the price performed, the function of eliciting supply and that the price carrier -- be out there for everyone to see in order to make his decisions by back dating it to the 1st of January 1961 that didn't -- was not in accord really with economic theory in our judgment of the two-price system.</text>
            <text syncTime="10200.689" offset="40802743">There is no question that in our mind that what we really end up here within the area rate making is a just and reasonable uniform price.</text>
            <text syncTime="10216.403" offset="40865541">As Mr. Solomon in the answer to a question from Mr. Justice Fortas indicated that the price could, by renegotiation go up to this just and reasonable price and the Commission by its regulations, if the contract permits it, producers can file up to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10235.486" offset="40941923">That's the theory of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="10237.597" offset="40950387">There is -- when you say that the price is just and reasonable, then there's an implication that that people want to be able to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10252.536" offset="41010051">But I would certainly join in the counsel's concern that there – be some indication on the part of the pipelines that it's -- that there is a quid pro quo for changing your contracts, because fundamentally, you can talk about group rate making but we are in fact fixing rates on individual producer with individual sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="10304.666" offset="41218612">It would take a long time on the balancing in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10311.308" offset="41245153">In order to hear all the arguments about whether the minimum rate should come up to the ceiling rate, indeed the -- as it were, the floor, whether or not a whole system of non-uniform rates rather than uniform rates be as -- be established and further grant -- the Court has also indicated that we have to go back into the quality section of the case and that might take a very long time indeed to unravel all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="10343.282" offset="41373048">I would bluntly say that what the Court of Appeals has done in the sense of its balancing notion is to try to import completely the notion of individual company cost of service rate making over to the area rate making as though the Permian Basin is some sort of super corporation and of course it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="10363.585" offset="41454237">It is many, many consumer or rather many producers operating in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="10371.506" offset="41486002">But we would have reason to believe that the Commission might have to start all over again and in fact, we would have to make certain demands that it do start all over again because we have trouble with the idea of value based prices being balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="10387.405" offset="41549531">If the – if they were cost based then causes less trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="10391.064" offset="41564160">But they're valued based and we know that there is something extra in there as the Commission itself concedes.</text>
            <text syncTime="10396.653" offset="41586521">So we do think it would take a considerable length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="10401.029" offset="41604075">Now I know that I've made many critical remarks of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="10405.761" offset="41622988">But let me close by saying that we think that the Commission has done a responsible job that it has addressed itself to all of the questions that this very complex area poses.</text>
            <text syncTime="10418.436" offset="41673665">We think that we might have been able to do better by the consumer but nevertheless, we think that all of the prices which had been adjudged in this case are in – are within the zone of reasonableness albeit as we see at page 32, Footnote 25 of our brief, at the very top of that zone of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="10442.478" offset="41769900">The problem of the contracts apparently is going to be a transitional thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="10447.028" offset="41788082">We would expect in the future that there are going to be contracts at the applicable just and reasonable area rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="10457.582" offset="41830296">We ask this Court from the consumer point of view to affirm the Opinion 468 in its entirety.</text>

            <text syncTime="10478.178" offset="41912633">Please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10479.480" offset="41917858">I represent the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, one of the California distributors that had been referred to here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="10487.654" offset="41950563">We participated in this case before the Commission because we were convinced that a price had to come out of this decision which would be adequate, but no higher than adequate to bring forth the supplies of gas that are required by the consumers in our area.</text>
            <text syncTime="10506.860" offset="42027363">Now, that statement which I just made, the price which is adequate and no higher than adequate or no higher than necessary is really a statement of the function which price plays in our basic economic system.</text>
            <text syncTime="10524.287" offset="42097058">And we approach this case from that point of view and retained economist as Commission counsel has described to you this morning, to help us make our presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10536.513" offset="42145959">And they, on their review of basic economic law concluded that that is just what should be done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="10543.921" offset="42175634">We should seek that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="10546.921" offset="42187651">Now, the question is how do you determine the price that is as high and no higher than necessary to bring forth the required supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="10555.958" offset="42223804">Parenthetically, I might say that the major producers interestingly enough adopt the same standard before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="10564.372" offset="42257450">But the dispute was, what evidence do you use?</text>
            <text syncTime="10568.602" offset="42274377">What you utilize to determine that price?</text>
            <text syncTime="10572.468" offset="42289842">Our economist told us and told the Commission to a testimony that such a price cannot be determined without some reference to cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="10582.000" offset="42327980">Some reference to cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="10583.856" offset="42335399">And also that price can only perform that function of eliciting supply in respect to such supplies as will be responsive to price.</text>
            <text syncTime="10595.770" offset="42383047">And the history of the industry was such that gas had not historically been responsible to the -- did not respond to the price of gas because gas was historically a byproduct found in the search for oil and produced in conjunction with the production of oil and thereby controlled by the demand for oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="10620.466" offset="42481789">And that therefore price will not perform that function, but with the advent of the directionality ability of the Commission -- of the producers, price could then perform that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="10633.292" offset="42533094">However, recognizing as the Commission recognized and as the Court, and as the evidence clearly demonstrates that the bulk of the flowing gas supplies were found as a result of the search for oil and as a byproduct of that search, it was therefore in economic terms fairly clear that paying an incentive price, a high price necessary to bring forth new gas-well discoveries would not be necessary in respect to that flowing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="10672.422" offset="42689620">And as a consequence, our economist suggested that that price need only be one that was fair and reasonable and the price will not perform the function which we had assigned to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10686.136" offset="42744477">Now you have heard a great deal of discussion today and you will certainly hear more tomorrow on costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="10695.906" offset="42783556">And I would like to talk today about cost as I take it from the proper context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10708.324" offset="42833293">Now, and I'll have to -- could I address for a moment to talk about what we're regulating hereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="10715.623" offset="42862446">What is being regulated is price.</text>
            <text syncTime="10717.971" offset="42871850">The producers aren't being regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="10720.150" offset="42880522">The producer is free to go out and search throughout the nation for gas or for oil and do whatever he wants with the funds that he gets from the sale of the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="10732.784" offset="42931096">He may engage in as much production as he wants to when he -- and as much exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="10739.004" offset="42955964">And when he finds gas, he can sell it anywhere he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="10742.889" offset="42971533">He can sell it in the intrastate market and if he sells it in intrastate market, the Commission has no jurisdiction over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10751.511" offset="43006015">And it is only if he sells it into the interstate market for resale, that his sale becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and hence to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10766.339" offset="43065260">Now, the record clearly demonstrates in this case that insofar as Permian gas is concerned, 50% of it is consumed intrastate, 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="10781.026" offset="43124088">And so we're talking about only 50% of the gas in the Permian Basin which goes into the interstate market which is subject to sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="10789.829" offset="43159301">Now, with that thought in mind, let's go back to cost as it is used in this proceeding and talk about cost of service for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10800.525" offset="43202038">Now, cost of service applied to a producer does not mean the cost of gas which is subject to that price order.</text>
            <text syncTime="10812.551" offset="43250103">It means the cost of engaging in the exploration development, production and sale of gas as the producing industry engaged in that business.</text>

            <text syncTime="10871.245" offset="43484891">Now, this 4.08 cents representing exploration in the flowing gas here, remembering now all along that this flowing gas cost is of gas-well gas which the Commission said and the highest cost of any of the types of gas which were being subject to the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10896.074" offset="43584261">But that cost study included 4.08 cents for exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="10901.966" offset="43607771">Now you know what that means, that means it includes for dry holes, geological and geophysical expenses, delayed rentals, abandoned leases, all of the expenses of a non-productive nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="10916.716" offset="43666808">Now, that is not the exploration cost which resulted in the gas that was flowing during 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="10925.761" offset="43702962">That was the exploration cost which was incurred during the year 1960 under the exploration programs conducted during that year which, however, to get the 4.08 was assigned to production during that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="10945.506" offset="43781956">And what does this mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="10947.566" offset="43790211">This means that the costs of exploration which the record demonstrates resulted in the finding on an average of 138% of production, 138% of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="10968.229" offset="43872862">The cost of that are included in the flowing gas cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="10972.383" offset="43889476">Now, immediately, we harkened back these overall traditional uses of public utility regulation in the Hope case itself, don't we?</text>
            <text syncTime="10981.487" offset="43925943">And what do we find there?</text>
            <text syncTime="10982.960" offset="43931794">The great question was whether or not original cost should be used, the Commission used, employed for fair value which is just replacement cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="10994.372" offset="43977456">So what do we have here?</text>
            <text syncTime="10995.804" offset="43983203">We're having that 4.08 cents per Mcf not only the replacement cost of the gas produced during that year, and we don't dispute that at all, but the amount of money necessary for the producers to find 38% more to increase their inventory by 38% more than they produced during that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="11020.314" offset="44081215">Now, we can also harken back the Hope and the quotation in Hope about -- well, from Natural Gas Pipeline Company, to the effect that a producer embarking upon a wasting asset business or a regulated entity embarking for the wasting asset business has no constitutional right to have more at the end of that business than he had at the beginning of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="11050.429" offset="44201691">Now, here, we have at the end of the business, the producer is going to have a 138% more than he had when he started.</text>
            <text syncTime="11059.494" offset="44237949">Now, we don't object to the inclusion of that extra amount which if you want to compute it, 138% and you go through all the mathematical maneuvers applying that to 4.08 cents, you come up with 1.11 cents per Mcf which I classify as a cushion against confiscation.</text>

            <text syncTime="11466.103" offset="45864333">Now, that's the finding of the Commission and that is the context in which the Commission was criticizing the cost studies in the record relative to casinghead gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="11480.255" offset="45920967">But the Commission also said in recognizing that will be sold, that even though there were cost studies of casinghead gas in the record which under this finding would still be overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="11495.965" offset="45983765">That even those cost studies were less than the cost yardstick employed by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="11714.413" offset="46857613">In 1954, this Court said in Phillips, “You, the Commission, whether you want to or not must regulate the fuel price of the producer”.</text>

            <text syncTime="11760.106" offset="47040366">So in fact, we in California were paying very high prices for gas flowing out of the Permian Basin, at the same time that this gas prices supposed to be regulated and in fact was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="12085.896" offset="48343562">Is the price in the words of Justice Jackson in the Hope Case going to bring -- to be an effective tool in bringing the gas to the market?</text>
            <text syncTime="12097.717" offset="48390792">We as distributors are greatly concerned over this as Mr. Ormasa has indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="12104.857" offset="48419422">We are -- have large amounts of plant as well as our consumers plants invested which would hardly be used for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="12119.083" offset="48476264">For this reason, we find that the producers' argument which we've heard time and time again, somewhat annoying but at the same time intriguing in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="12133.341" offset="48533316">You've heard it today, that they should be allowed to have their unregulated contract prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="12139.514" offset="48557976">And unless they have their unregulated contract prices, they won't bring the gas to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="12146.988" offset="48587860">Now, this is annoying because this Court has said on numerous occasions as it ordered the Federal Power Commissions to get on with the job of regulation, in the CATCO decision, and other decision so that there's no help to suggest in effect to non-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="12169.128" offset="48676467">It is intriguing to me in this respect that the actual effect in the Permian Basin has in a way mocked the claim of the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="12189.649" offset="48758596">I'm sure, they may be unhappy about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="12195.076" offset="48780225">But practically, in a lot of steps with the proceedings we're considering here and after the guideline where prices were adopted in 1960 and at 16 cents, a prodigious and very prolific effort commenced in the Permian Basin, in the deep Delaware and the (Inaudible) portion of that Basin where these producers we're going down to depths of 20,000 feet below the surface of the Earth, the deepest gas wells in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="12232.953" offset="48931736">This commenced in about 1961 at the same time that Dr. Hills, their witness, testified before the Commission as the second witness that this would be the area where the gas would have to come from and there would have to be incentives to bring the gas forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="12255.589" offset="49022328">And Mr. Justice Fortas, one of the reasons why they can look for gas as distinguished from oil was that as -- that's it's a physical fact that the further you go in depth, the less you get an oil, the more you're getting gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="12275.181" offset="49100696">Anyway, they've been going to these great depths to get this gas and this is since -- let's say in 1960, the Commission adopted the guideline prices of 16 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="12289.923" offset="49159628">In 1964, Examiner Ware (ph) came up with the 16 and three-quarter cents for new gas in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="12300.063" offset="49200170">And finally, in 1965, the Commission came out with it and the price you were considering here, 16 and a half cents is the ceiling price.</text>
            <text syncTime="12309.413" offset="49237577">All of this period, these men who are I'm sure very hardheaded not in the sense that they are dumb but in the sense that they are economically astute, were drilling for gas in the Permian Basin and it became one of the large producing areas in recent time.</text>
            <text syncTime="12335.892" offset="49343530">Now this is documented in the -- not only in the record but subsequent to the record, the Commission who has the same concern that you have, is this going to work, the Commission had before it a number of cases including the Pipeline case that Mr. Ormasa referred to which was all in Opinion 500 where they said -- they preferred a large pipeline expansion of El Paso and Transwestern coming partially at least as a reserve or partially out of the Permian Basin over this competing project which would have dedicated 6 trillion feet of east -- Eastern, Southeastern Texas gas to the West Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="12385.076" offset="49540284">So the Commission knew at that time and they continues to have cases, Opinion 519 to new pipeline projects into the Permian basis -- Basin just adopted in March of this year that the gas is forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="12401.328" offset="49605277">We don't say that this is the end of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="12404.194" offset="49616771">We say that the price is acting as a tool and hopefully we believe that it will continue and that the Commission will -- through its continuing jurisdiction develop and refine this method so that they can keep in touch with what's going on in the field and bring the gas so that we can use it in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="12431.262" offset="49725022">Thank you.</text>
