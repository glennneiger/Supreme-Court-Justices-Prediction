            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Joseph Lee Jones et al., versus Alfred H. Mayer Company et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.713" offset="143214">Mr. Treiman, you may continue with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Israel Treiman</label>
            <text syncTime="15.006" offset="164425">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.235" offset="185323">I should like to pass now as quickly as possible to what I regard as the pivotal points of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.952" offset="236210">And I should like to consider those points in two categories corresponding to the two grounds on which the petitioners and the major briefs, that is the Government brief and the NCADH brief, and I must say two or three others, claimed that the District Court was wrong in dismissing the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.219" offset="353238">And that the petitioners are entitled to recover on the basis of the allegations set forth in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.252" offset="385421">Now, taking up the first claim, the first ground, which has to do with this Civil Rights Act of 1866 or rather that portion of it which appears today in Section 1982 of Title 42 of United States Code which incidentally the Government and its brief refers to by its revised statute designation of Section 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.516" offset="506420">Here, Your Honors, we deal with a question of pure statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.398" offset="541947">And I should like to emphasize that, particularly in view of the question that I believe Mr. Justice Fortas asked of counsel for the petitioners yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.822" offset="583638">Mr. Justice Fortas, as I recall asked counsel who was then discussing, I believe the constitutionality of this Section under the Thirteenth Amendment whether one could not presume that the respondents would take the position that this Section owe its constitution of validity to the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Thirteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.587" offset="698786">And as I recall, Counsel for the petitioners and I'm sure there was no intention or whatsoever on his part to put the respondent in an incorrect position or mislead the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.380" offset="749881">Counsel for the petitioners said, yes, he would presume that our position would be, that this Section owes its life, owes its constitutional life, you might say to the Fourteenth rather than the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.935" offset="812157">It seems therefore that the repetition on the emphasis with which I thought, I had made it clear in my brief that we were not concerned with the constitutionality of this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.075" offset="864716">That therefore it mattered not to us whether it should be regarded as rooted in the Thirteenth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, escaped the attention of counsel for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.984" offset="920304">But, as Your Honors will recall in connection with another question counsel for the petitioners did say that we had conceded the constitutionality of this Civil Rights Act which is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.672" offset="979132">And it's for that reason that in our brief, we open up by saying that one of the three questions which the petitioners present as questions presented in this case maybe eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.703" offset="1035243">And that question in the petitioner's brief was whether the -- whether Section 1982 is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.560" offset="1066590">We are not questioning the constitutionality of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.852" offset="1079756">What are we questioning then?</text>
            <text syncTime="245.830" offset="1087697">We're questioning the meaning of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.561" offset="1098668">It is no matter of congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.478" offset="1110267">But at the end of the Thirteenth or the Fourteenth or any other provision of the constitution, it isn't a question of whether had Congress in 1866 passed an Act which was directed against individual conduct whether Congress thereby was exercising a valid power either under the Thirteenth or the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.252" offset="1197411">That incidentally maybe a question that will be raised if Congress should pass a fair Housing Bill, of course, because under your customary fair housing bill, it's the individual owner or seller who is prohibited from discriminating of that may raise a question as to whether under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment the enabling Section or Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.579" offset="1302737">Congress has the power to enact legislation of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.549" offset="1322590">That is not the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.035" offset="1328546">So, I come to what I think is the crucial question.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.887" offset="1351952">With respect to this statute that has been made so mush of that the honorable Attorney General relied so heavily on yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.069" offset="1396673">This statute has some very simple words, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.561" offset="1418616">It's a question what those words mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.092" offset="1424781">And if you kept down to what I think are the key words, what are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="335.286" offset="1445575">It says, “Every person shall have the same right to buy property as is enjoyed by white citizens”.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.818" offset="1499700">What does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="350.737" offset="1507328">What does the word “right” in that sentence mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="353.160" offset="1517046">Does it mean right in the sense of legal ability, legal competence to buy, own, and incidentally inherit?</text>
            <text syncTime="362.942" offset="1556125">That word is also used in the statute; property and self property.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.158" offset="1577023">Or does it mean something more than that?</text>
            <text syncTime="372.201" offset="1593219">Doesn't mean something that is not so much related to the status of the -- or the position of the buyer as it is to the seller, to the conduct of a seller, something that is not just a matter of right but of matter of duty, a duty imposed upon the seller.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>

          <turn speaker="israel_treiman" startTime="398.600" stopTime="1111.330">
            <label>Mr. Israel Treiman</label>
            <text syncTime="398.600" offset="1698753">1982 which is the Section involved here or 1978 of the revised statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.184" offset="1725085">That is a portion by the way, a portion of the original Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.213" offset="1745251">You'll find that portion in the first Section of the original Act which had a number of Sections in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.998" offset="1772419">Well now the petitioners in this case claimed that this Section is directed and was intended to be directed against the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.064" offset="1828634">That it didn't simply mean right in the sense of right by law legal competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.273" offset="1857473">And in order to prove -- we of course take the position that this Section should be construed as being in confined to laws or official action of some kind which say that a Negro shall not have the same right as a white citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.604" offset="1930825">And it was -- it cannot be and should not be construed as being aimed, that individual, the individual behavior of a seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.255" offset="1965411">Now in order to prove that its construction is correct, the petitioners and the writers of the NCADH brief, NCADH brief and that particularly the Government, I say particularly the Government for a reason which I'll mention shortly, insist on taking us back to the year 1866, to the early part of the year 1866, on the 39th Congress enacted this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.308" offset="2101666">And I must say, Your Honors, that when I saw in the Government's brief, the historical materials, the -- not secondary but primary source materials on which apparently the Government claimed its construction would be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.267" offset="2189437">I shuddered a little bit because it meant that I would have to indulge in some historical research.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.626" offset="2226949">And I do not profess to be expert in delving into historical materials but I felt that as a lawyer, and especially since the Government gave me the specific leads, it blueprinted these sources specifically the materials which it said would prove that that was the intention of Congress in 1866, and so I went to these sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.514" offset="2334469">Now, what were they?</text>
            <text syncTime="559.607" offset="2342828">Now, I'll make this as brief as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.698" offset="2355158">The Government claims that if you consult the statements, the speeches made in Congress, the 39th Congress, the speeches of the sponsors of this Section -- of this Act of 1866, the speeches of the opponents of the Act, and one other statement, the statement of President Andrew Johnson, when he vetoed this bill, the reasons that he gave for vetoing the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.355" offset="2481800">You will find says the Government that the bill must have been intended to be directed against individual action.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.169" offset="2509072">I must say since I mentioned President Johnson's veto message in order that the Court may follow me in connection with another matter which I shall presently mention, a very important matter which does involved a matter of comparing dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.761" offset="2571452">This Act of 1866 was first enacted on March 13, 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.901" offset="2599978">President Johnson vetoed.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.544" offset="2610531">It was then reenacted over the President's veto on April 9, which is a date usually given as a date of enactment of this Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.693" offset="2655148">Now, I went into the statements, the speeches made in the congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.744" offset="2683361">The references are all given in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.394" offset="2697989">It was not known by the way as a congressional record that -- yes, they seemed congressional globe.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.823" offset="2719723">And I took the statements of the chairman of the judiciary committee of the House of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.124" offset="2756921">And I took the statements, the speeches; I read them all, of the sponsors of the bill, the people who supported the bills in both bodies of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.968" offset="2800285">I then went to the opponents of the bill and I got their statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.906" offset="2816063">And I have set forth in my brief, department passages from the statements of all of those Congressmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.057" offset="2848664">And then I went to President Johnson's veto message.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.431" offset="2862143">And I have set forth in my brief the pertinent passage from his message.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.065" offset="2884608">All of which I submit Your Honors overwhelmingly, convincingly, proved that the bill was never intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.447" offset="2930166">This Civil Rights Act of 1866 was never intended to be directed at anything but laws, legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.189" offset="2961199">And then I went to the other sources, the second source that the Government set, the second document on which it said it would be -- could be shown that this bill was intended not to be directed against discriminatory laws but individual conduct and what was that?</text>
            <text syncTime="730.641" offset="3026923">Now, this is quite interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.091" offset="3036745">The Government says that there are two documents, a Senate executive document and a House executive document, which will prove that in all of the Black codes that were enacted after the Civil War, some of them maybe before.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.704" offset="3127233">By the time Congress got to deliberating on this Act, all disqualification of Negroes to own property had been removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.912" offset="3168089">Now, this is quite a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.218" offset="3173313">It's in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.270" offset="3177493">I think it reads -- it appears that in none of the Black codes in the early part of 1966 was there any disqualification left to the Negro from owning property?</text>
            <text syncTime="779.217" offset="3221274">I then went to these two documents and what were they?</text>
            <text syncTime="783.489" offset="3238306">Both of these documents contained, each contains a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.645" offset="3255024">A report prepared by the then Secretary of State Mr. Stewart under the direction of President Johnson for submission to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.395" offset="3285953">So that Congress would know what was going on so far as discriminatory legislation was concerned, discriminatory as against the Negro of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.419" offset="3954061">And what does the report say?</text>
            <text syncTime="807.181" offset="3953957">I must say I was dismayed of what I found in the light of what the Government asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.563" offset="3953852">I found that according to that report which incidentally Your Honors adheres where that date becomes important in connection with the date of the passage of this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.129" offset="3953748">This report is dated May 22, 1966, which was after the originally enactment of the bill as well as its reenactment following President Johnson's veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.892" offset="3953643">It says that in all -- it let -- it reviews a number of the Southern States.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.904" offset="3953539">And it says that in all of those states with two exceptions, the disqualifications of the Negroes still remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.844" offset="3953434">It points it out very clearly and I will presently show how.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.680" offset="3953330">Apparently, what happened was and in each of these states, a state convention was called, as this is of course familiar Post Civil War history.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.410" offset="3953225">A state convention was called by the provincial Governor of the state appointed by President Johnson, Andrew Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.491" offset="3953121">The convention was called and of course it was completely dominated by the Northerners and their Southern sympathizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.814" offset="3953016">And so, there was no difficulty whatsoever in getting resolutions adopted that would be in line with Northern feelings.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.723" offset="3952912">In each of these states says this report, in each of these states, first, there was a resolution adopted, proclaiming that there would be no more slavery in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.205" offset="3952807">Then it was followed in -- I think every case by another resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.379" offset="3952703">And that second resolution called upon the chairman of the convention to appoint a committee or a commission that would come in with a set of recommended laws, revisions of the then existing state laws in order to bring the state laws into conformity with the Thirteenth Amendment, with the emancipation situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.921" offset="3952598">And what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="929.822" offset="3952494">According to this report, most of these cases such a committee was appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.711" offset="3952389">In several of the cases, several of the states, the committee actually went to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.166" offset="3952285">And there is set forth in the report a set of statutes in which, of course, all disqualification of the Negro was eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.450" offset="3952180">But this was a set of statutes which the committee, the commission, and the convention resolved, should be recommended for enactment by the local legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.881" offset="3963883">Except in two cases, Texas and Georgia as of the date of this report, no such legislation has yet been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.563" offset="4006619">And interestingly enough, even in Texas and Georgia which had changed their laws and had removed disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.360" offset="4037862">When did that take place?</text>
            <text syncTime="985.287" offset="4045594">Not before this bill was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.813" offset="4055625">In one case it took place several weeks but in both cases, it took place after the first enactment of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.164" offset="4085091">And in one case, it took place before its reenactment but certainly after the originally enactment of this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.775" offset="4115498">For the Government therefore to say that when Congress was debating, considering this bill, there was no need to do anything about discriminatory laws from these black codes to me is astonishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.259" offset="4169415">It's contradicted by the evidence I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.871" offset="4179864">And furthermore, Your Honors, if you want what I say in my brief, it's probably the best succinct piece of evidence on that point that you would want.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.833" offset="13103710">I think perhaps a better statute would be Section 1988 which is derived from Section 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and specifically says that civil actions may get the remedy from the state common law as modified by statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.771" offset="13175495">Thirdly, I would say that regardless that there was any statute that Congress did not intend to create a right without a remedy in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.968" offset="13208304">That this legislation was a result going back to the civil war perhaps at that time the bloodiest war ever fought in the history of mankind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.017" offset="13248428">And following the Thirteenth Amendment, (Inaudible) was enacted once, passed over the veto of President Johnson and then enacted the third time in 1870.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.224" offset="13417284">Well, but in addition, I do think that there is a statutory authority for a civil remedy in the Court in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.884" offset="13471932">As to the interpretation of the statute, I wanted to go back briefly to the passages quoted from Mr. Treiman's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.626" offset="13506936">On page 15, you'll note that the quotation, the first both to laws barbaric and treatment inhumane are the words meted out by our white enemies to our colored friends, obviously referring to both state law and private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.572" offset="13566704">Across the page on page 14, I think the quote is obviously referring in Section 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which is limited, done or a color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.276" offset="13609545">But that limitation -- the Congress knew how to make and made it in much legislation and left it out in the Section 1 and Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.242" offset="13641415">So, that I think you can fairly interpret their intention as living it out intentionally when they didn't mean for it to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.889" offset="13679971">This legislation unlike the prior Freedmen's Bureau Bill applied to all states not just to the states which had been in rebellion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.896" offset="13716020">And I think that it was aimed at the results and the holding of this Court in Scott versus Sanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.586" offset="13746740">To some extent, it was not just to wipe out inimical state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.532" offset="13766489">It was to grant the rights to which people were entitled regardless of whether the particular state they were in had a law that would've limited that right or not as applied everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.622" offset="13810897">So that -- so our contention that the law -- we don't argue that it would overwrite any state law to the contrary because it says right at the end, any law statute ordinance regulation accustomed to the contrary not withstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.174" offset="13873068">But we think it had a broader purpose as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.518" offset="13890518">If it were only attempting to remove a certain disqualifications, I think this would've been accomplished by the constitutional amendments anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.333" offset="13925731">But it also would've been accomplished by the other parts of Section 1 of that Act, which gave all persons the equal right to make enforced contracts, to sue and be parties, give evidence in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.415" offset="13974006">And to the same -- fall on equal benefit of all laws and proceedings by the security of persons and properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.275" offset="13997516">So, I think that language alone would've remove any disqualification whether by state law or otherwise and that when they go on to say, shall have the same right to inherit, and to purchase and to lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.023" offset="14048507">That they meant that he would have the substantive right, the same right as is enjoyed by all other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.545" offset="14074525">And if this was the interpretation which Congress had and which is the only fair interpretation on the basis of the language of the statute.</text>
