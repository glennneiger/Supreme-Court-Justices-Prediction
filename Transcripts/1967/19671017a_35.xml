            <text syncTime="16.146" offset="170047">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.237" offset="182376">The facts of this case that is now before the Court are really quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.983" offset="197319">The law applicable is something else again.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.642" offset="207976">But the facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.430" offset="215186">Mr. Katz was surveilled by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a period of approximately six days.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.805" offset="244652">During that period of time, the surveillance was conducted by the use of a microphone being taped on top of a public telephone booth or a bank booth, so it was actually three booths.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.805" offset="284672">One booth had been placed out of order by the telephone company and with the telephone company's cooperation, the other two booths were used by Mr. Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.029" offset="317586">Sometimes he used one booth, sometimes he used another.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.810" offset="328662">The tape was placed on top of the booth or the microphone was placed on top by a tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.555" offset="351650">The FBI Agents had undoubtedly read their homework and had not physically penetrated into the area of the telephone booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.524" offset="387490">Subsequently after about six days of surveillance, Mr. Katz was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.532" offset="407552">He was then taken to his apartment building where his room was searched under a search warrant and numerous items were seized from Mr. Katz's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.565" offset="443705">The issues before the Court are fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.210" offset="454259">One, whether or not, the search and seizure or one of the interceptions of the telephone communications was prescribed by the Fourth Amendment; and two, whether or not, the warrant that was used to search his apartment building is constitutionally proper or constitutionally defective.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.481" offset="1483379">In any event, after the following of certiorari in this case, Your Honor, the Court's decision of Berger versus of New York; we think, is somewhat simplified with the problem that we had presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.298" offset="1522563">There was some question, I think, up to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.334" offset="1530713">Maybe there was some question as to whether or not a conversation was the subject or the proper subject of the Fourth Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.177" offset="1562164">And whether you could -- the capture of such conversation was a search in seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.333" offset="1578778">In Berger, this Court specifically so held and perhaps Mr. Justice Douglas' comment that the Olmstead was overruled sub silentio is accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.408" offset="1615036">We believe it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.830" offset="1624754">We think that if you begin with what seems to be the undeniable premise that the interception in the instant case of a telephone communication is within the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.600" offset="1663833">That is this subject of a potential search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.622" offset="1679924">Then this case is very easy and it sort of turns on what the Chief Justice has said about a moment ago about the interceptions itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.920" offset="1709077">It should be pointed out to the Court that the interceptions are accomplished without a warrant and they cannot be justified as incident to a lawful arrest for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.923" offset="1749096">Of course this Court has said incurred that searches and seizures are justifiable in only three instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.046" offset="1769576">One involves consensual search, which of course is not involve in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.223" offset="1782324">The other two instances is being search with a warrant and instant to lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.742" offset="1804372">As I said no warrant in this case and the arrest in this case was after all of the electronic interception took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.005" offset="1837390">So as I understand the federal rule that since the search was -- preceded the arrest, it could not be justified as incidental to a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.309" offset="1870618">On that basis alone, on the base of the interception, was not without warrant -- not incidental and as we conclude in and respectfully submit that the case is decidable in that point alone and it should be reversed on that point alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.255" offset="1922445">However -- and this is the reason we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.102" offset="1933834">One possible way to get around this argument that, it was not in illegal search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.862" offset="1956822">It evolves around the determination of the issue of whether or not a telephone booth is a constitutionally protected area.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.986" offset="1985348">And of course, that's the issue on which certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.894" offset="2004992">We think and respectfully submit to the Court that whether or not, a telephone booth or any area is constitutionally protected, is the wrong initial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.439" offset="2047206">We do not believe that the question should be determined as to whether or not, let's say you have an invasion of a constitutionally protected area, that shouldn't be the initial inquiry, but rather that probably should be the conclusion that is reached after the application of a test such as that we propose are similar test.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.812" offset="2120662">Now, we have proposed in our brief and there's nothing magical or ingenious about our test.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.176" offset="2142083">It's an objective test which stresses the rule of reason, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.756" offset="2160473">The test really asks or opposes the question, “Would a reasonable person objectively looking at the communication setting, the situation and location of a communicator and communicatee -- would he reasonably believe that that communication was intended to be confidential?”</text>
            <text syncTime="531.006" offset="2229436">We think that in applying this test there are several criteria that can be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="732.019" offset="3033485">As a constitutional lawyer, I believe that within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment and with the sufficient protections present, I think there can be bugging.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.533" offset="3075594">And I think this Court in Berger indicate that if there is sufficient protection present, that there can be in a given setting with probable cause and specificity in terms of items to be searched, in terms of persons to be searched, I think you might in a constitutional sense have a situation where an artificial listening device may be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.212" offset="4038259">The way he did this apparently was, he took of the electrical apparatus although, I assumed it was the wall plug where the sockets go.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.640" offset="6111963">I respectfully call the Court's attention that the Fourth Amendment after paraphrasing a little bit here, but it says people have a right to be “Secure in their persons.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.623" offset="6155954">That is the very first item of protection that is contained in the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.949" offset="7301266">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.849" offset="7316835">I think that the heart of petitioner's argument to a certain extent is a radical change in the concept to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.137" offset="7342017">I think as Mr. Justice Brennan mentioned, it has been said in recent years that the Fourth Amendment protects more rights of privacy than rights in property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.402" offset="7382977">However this Court has never held the right of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment, does not exist within the framework of a constitutionally protected area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.320" offset="7422683">As counsel mentioned, Mr. Justice Holmes speaking for unanimous Court, this Court's opinion in Hester versus the United States, said very clearly, “The protections of the Fourth Amendment do not extend to an open field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.543" offset="7479630">To adapt the test which counsel has suggested in this case would radically change the rules under which law enforcement has been operating for a long time with the approval of this Court, and I mean it in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.991" offset="7533338">It seems to me that to say that no matter where the activity takes place, it is protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.758" offset="7568447">The subjects to that Amendment not only the matter of what is overheard, but what is observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.814" offset="7604705">Assume, if you would please, the following situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.636" offset="7615990">Take the case that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.967" offset="7625289">And instead of the agents being interested in hearing what Mr. Marks said, but let's assume it was a kidnapping case and they knew that this booth had been used on one occasion too by the kidnapper to call with regard to ransom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.124" offset="7677952">And the kidnapper had scheduled to call for eight o'clock in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.998" offset="7697387">So as not to scare him off, the agents might station themselves in another building some distance away, and armed with binoculars perhaps even in infrared scope that would allow them to see at night, put this telephone booth under surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.946" offset="7757155">The kidnapper would approach that booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.258" offset="7766455">He might look around to make sure that he was secured, that nobody was observing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.199" offset="7790174">He would be wrong in his conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.262" offset="7806474">I assumed that under Mr. Mark's -- Mr. Schneider's rationale that the fact that the agents saw him entered the booth, but they could not testify that that would be an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.146" offset="7854017">I think that this Court has always recognized the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.027" offset="7869482">That one is protected is the right to privacy which exists within a constitutionally protected area, within a home, within an office, some area in which the party involved has an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.257" offset="7922458">It may not have to be a property interest of a tenant or an owner, maybe that of a guest in those premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2296.635" offset="9292006">Early in February of 1965, the agents received information from reliable informants, which led them to believe that the petition in this case, Mr. Katz, was using the public phone, this particular public phone booth to place wages in interstate by calling Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.919" offset="9377061">On to that information, they undertook surveillance both to Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.133" offset="9389913">They found that he was using this particular booth which was approximately four blocks from his hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.947" offset="9413214">On a regular basis at regular periods of the day, having surveilled into this booth on a number of occasions they didn't check the telephone records, telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.232" offset="9454383">They found that he was calling the number of a known gambler in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.853" offset="9480819">It was only after or they had all of this information that the agents undertook the surveillance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.343" offset="9526794">After they had all of this information they then set up a system involving a team of five agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.307" offset="9554693">The recorder was placed on the top of the phone booth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.226" offset="9594295">They were taped on the top of the booth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.185" offset="9618119">They would follow Mr. Katz as he left his hotel and at a point approximately one and half blocks from the phone booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.677" offset="9644136">When he got to that point, the surveilling agents would call and radio to the agents at the booth, who at that point would go over and activate the recorder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.112" offset="12009890">I think the reason the agents didn't get warrant in this particular case is a very practical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.461" offset="12027235">I think the agents in this case as Mr. Schneider said they've done their homework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.183" offset="12042177">And they were relying upon this Court's decision of Goldman, and felt that they had complied with that, that there was no penetration to a constitutional protected area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.563" offset="12075719">And therefore, it was for that reason, they didn't seek warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.247" offset="12090452">Also under Rule 41, there would be some difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.208" offset="12106230">And I'm not prepared to say either way, I think it is questionable whether or not you could get a warrant for the seizure of words in Rule 41 by its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.568" offset="12155653">To often date, it says that warrant shall issue for the seizure of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.954" offset="12173208">And it later defines property as any books, records, documents, or other tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.561" offset="12215630">So there is a problem under Rule 41 as to whether or not, you could get a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.457" offset="12495245">And I'm not sure that in fact, it's not accorded to the Federal Rules requires therefore exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.407" offset="12559088">But going pass that, I think that there is some evidence in the Court's opinion even though the rules now provide of an inherent power where perhaps a search warrant could have been obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.944" offset="12609243">I think this was - you had the same situation to Osborn where the Court proved a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.037" offset="12633590">And it seems to me that there might be some question under whether that was in full conformity with Rule 41 because the problem with the rule authorizing only the seizure property.</text>

            <text syncTime="4770.209" offset="19186249">And I sincerely believed that the Court held -- the majority in Berger held that they will uphold reason -- will uphold statutes which are finely and narrowly drawn as being within the framework of the Fourth Amendment, then it doesn't matter what the crime is assuming that -- and some of the justices state that that should be a matter of experimentation let up to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.537" offset="19291575">I just noted with interest before I left Los Angeles, they come here, I received a notice in the -- a press release that Senator Long's bill for instance had gone into the Senate Judiciary Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="4812.982" offset="19357299">There are numerous other bills and other legislature which want to allow law enforcements such as in the crime commission study to investigate the fact of any crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="4834.661" offset="19444025">And with respect to that also, it seems to me that in the Osborn case, a search warrant was in fact issued notwithstanding what you might have called the procedures that the judges instituted to put a bug on the man to go and listen to the lawyer's conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.734" offset="19532319">Because what happened was if there was an affidavit based on probable cause to believe that a specific crime had been committed and they're after an order by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.634" offset="19575996">And you could call it what you want but it seems to me it was a search warrant that was issued by the Court to hear specific conversation by the eavesdropper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.121" offset="19613926">And that, you can call it an authorization but it seems to me that without a question, there was a search warrant in Osborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.619" offset="19647885">In the instant case, if you want to turn it on search warrant probably there was ample probable cause in my opinion for the FBI who as my Brother, Mr. Schneider said did their homework, and I don't think they did it enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.661" offset="19728029">They had the following information before they put the bug in the phone, that Mr. Katz was making phone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.165" offset="19758122">They knew that he was making phone calls to person they suspected to be a bookmaker.</text>

            <text syncTime="5290.620" offset="21267895">And again the Hester case might go upon that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.309" offset="21286703">Although again, I think with all due respect that Justice Holmes made an ipsy-dipsy statement about the feel of not being a constitutionally protected area because from what I understand the case now was very sparse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.890" offset="21373012">There was in fact a physical trespass on the land of another by the agents which might not have been warned and that might have invalidated the entire search such as in the Hurst case which was a little bit later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.050" offset="21433616">And as I say, it's quite an old case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.510" offset="21439467">And the changes and the thoughts of what were constitutionally protected areas have made quite a few strides since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.234" offset="21558376">Now, with respect somewhat to this Frank case problem, it's a very unusual situation that has occurred here and probably the reason that there have been no cases before involving Mr. Katz's particular situation is that it doesn't happen very often, although if the Court wouldn't allow it to happen, it might happen consistently more and more.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.542" offset="21691601">And that is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.869" offset="21696930">Mr. Katz had, before he went to trial, an absolute right not to testify against himself, not to be compelled to make any testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="5444.935" offset="21885116">I don't know exactly what he testified to in the grand jury since that was private.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.726" offset="21908313">But the interesting point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.478" offset="21923359">That after Mr. Katz had been convicted and while he was contesting his conviction, the grand jury wanted to question him about matters which involved what he was -- the conviction that he was appealing from.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.041" offset="21997547">And in order to compel this testimony, the court below on the first go around put Mr. Katz in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.261" offset="22038507">And he spent 90 days in jail somewhat until the first grand jury had expired protecting his right not to have to testify even though when there was a grant of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.958" offset="22097230">Now, we go to the second proposition that the Government says we granted him immunity and now he decided to testify because he didn't want to go to jail again, which is a type of compulsion that I think is the greatest of all to get a man to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.572" offset="22163686">Now, they say, “We've used whatever compulsion we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.007" offset="22181449">We forced him into a position where he has to testify or stay in jail and nevertheless if its conviction isn't reversed, we still have the benefits of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.827" offset="22236724">We still have the benefits whatever that maybe to the Unites States Government of $300.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.191" offset="22258145">And we've got some additional evidence to go out and get somebody else.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.628" offset="22279983">Now, whether or not this Court has rejected the quid pro quo argument, there seems to be something basically unfair about compelling a man to testify when he doesn't want to testify, unless you give him something for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.492" offset="22339438">And that's why I think the Reina case may not be proper as a matter of due process of law, whatever we want to call it, fairness between the Government and that the individual who is being subjected to penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.171" offset="22398056">I think therefore that the Frank case should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="5580.622" offset="22427941">Well, Reina was a different situation because Mr. Reina could have said being in jail, “I don't want to testify,” and there was no compulsion whatsoever that the Court could give him to force him to testify because it's all the Court could say is go to jail and he could say, I'm in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.229" offset="22506308">So you can't do anything to me because I don't know these particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.094" offset="22525848">He was trying to strike a bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.914" offset="22541103">And I think he might have done a little bit more table finding he might have got a part of the bargain that he wanted but I don't think you have to overrule the entire case because the situation is different for the person in jail and out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.138" offset="22618008">And it depends on what compulsion the Government can use against the person in order to determine what benefits he is to get from the testimony which otherwise would not have to give unless there was this immunity statute, which is interposed between it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.185" offset="22702122">With respect to the warrants, I concur with my Brother, Mr. Schneider.</text>

            <text syncTime="5659.308" offset="22742664">I know how far the courts have extended to say that there is -- certain objects are fruits and instrumentalities of a particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.704" offset="22780280">I know that now that the Court has said that there may be a search for mere evidence that the discretion of the officer as to what is evidence is going to be so broad as to make every search warrant, in my opinion, a general search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.996" offset="22861364">In the instant case, the best that can be said for instance about Mr. Katz's yellow sheets of paper that have the basketball scores on them was that there were some evidence of the fact that he might have been in the business of wagering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.824" offset="22956763">And therefore the warrant that issued was in that sense a general warrant and a search for mere evidence, and not a search for the instrumentalities of the crime because he didn't need those papers to make a bet or to make a wager.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.756" offset="23020398">They helped them at some time but they weren't instrumentalities of the crime of transmitting the wager for the gambling information.</text>

            <text syncTime="5794.398" offset="23282981">Finally, I might say this and this is a test that I think the Court can take it's own judicial notice if we took the test and of course again, it's outside of the record but the Attorney General, that's the Solicitor General submitted it somewhat on his own that you can overhear a conversation from an adjoining phone booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.383" offset="23354974">I submit that if the Court wants to make a test, go and sit in some phone booth, the one at the Sunset Boulevard, it's the ordinary type with a little glass door.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.944" offset="23389247">Just sit in it and listen next door and see if you can hear a person and determine what he is saying in an ordinary conversational voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.465" offset="23419235">I submit that you cannot so hear and that there was intended to give privacy and this right of privacy of the individual should be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.804" offset="23448597">Thank you.</text>
