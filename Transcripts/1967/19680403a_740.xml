            <label>Mr. James M. Nabrit III</label>
            <text syncTime="25.300" offset="204570">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.606" offset="217840">This case is here on certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which affirmed an order entered by the District Court in the western district of Tennessee, approving a desegregation plan proposed by the school authorities in Jackson, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.235" offset="304358">At the outset before I begin a description of the facts and proceedings, let me attempt to state the issue as I see it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.468" offset="353259">The question I think is whether a School Board which has maintained a dual segregated system satisfies its obligations under the equal protection clause simply by seizing its illegal practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.218" offset="428283">Its practices of assigning pupils on the basis of race of whether on the other hand, the Court should require such boards to begin affirmative steps to thoroughly dismantle the dual segregated system and bring about a system which is no longer segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.388" offset="516890">Now the courts below have agreed with the School Board’s argument which is that their only obligations is to stop using race to assign pupils to declare neutrality and that so long as they don’t use race anymore, it doesn’t matter what happens, it doesn’t matter if they argue that the school there may be largely segregated as they were before.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.335" offset="620753">The petitioner's view in our basic submission today, is that it is not enough merely for the boards to stop their illegal and unconstitutional practices but that in addition, the school authorities have to take steps designed to actually reform the dual system of schools which they have built up to integrate them if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.038" offset="715525">In other words, we urge that the remedy must be designed to purely evil and that the evil was the racially segregated school system that the authorities have put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.535" offset="773517">This is a very basic and fundamental question I think about the meaning of the Brown decision because the Court is familiar with the war that's been going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.052" offset="815626">A war that many public officials have been waging against the Brown decision for all these years and I think the School Boards and these cases are still fighting that war.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.886" offset="854915">They have sophisticated arguments but they are indeed fighting to keep just as much segregation in these school systems as the courts will let them keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.719" offset="894203">That's what's involved here and that's the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.539" offset="905488">Will we have real reform of the segregated school systems or will the courts be content with nominal and token compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.521" offset="949478">United States Civil Rights Commission examined a situation filed and made a report to the Congress and the President last July and it pointed out that in many areas there has been commendable progress but that nevertheless, vast majority of Negro children are still denied the rights, their rights under the decision in the school segregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.772" offset="1054490">The Commission said its conclusion, if these rights are to be secured, this cannot be a time for retrenchment or wavering of purpose and this is our view too.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.905" offset="1111019">Now, I think it is helpful to look a bit at the particular facts of the Jackson, Tennessee school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.978" offset="1143306">Jackson has 13 schools, a little more than 7600 pupils, about 60% of them are White and about 40% Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.003" offset="1187401">When petitioners filed this lawsuit in January 1963, there were -- there was still complete segregation of faculty and pupils except for seven Negroes where they admitted in White schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.431" offset="1253125">There were eight White schools and five Negro schools and today, after five years of litigation, we still have the five all Negro schools attended by 80% of the Negro pupils in the county, a little more than 80%.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.337" offset="1332746">Now in August 1963 when the District Court first approved a desegregation plan for Jackson, Tennessee, it approved the plan calling for gradual desegregation in five annual steps of various grade levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.125" offset="1407875">And the plan proposed by the School Board provided for school zones, provided that each school building would have a geographic attendance area around it but -- and they also made provisions for pupils to transfer out of the areas where they lived and the plan that the judge approved was that any transfer arrangements that the School Board wanted to make would be acceptable provided the court said they were reasonable and were not based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.018" offset="1535457">Now, after in the fall of --</text>

            <text syncTime="361.451" offset="1549145">And that means that it was a free transfer system?</text>

            <text syncTime="368.273" offset="1576417">I think that's what the district judge --</text>

            <text syncTime="371.309" offset="1588642">No, I mean -- is that any different from the Kent County type of plans?</text>

            <text syncTime="376.801" offset="1610585">Well, it's not now but it was -- I was telling the events chronologically.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.759" offset="1638379">I see.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="384.064" stopTime="591.132">
            <label>Mr. James M. Nabrit III</label>
            <text syncTime="384.064" offset="1639633">Now, we have free choice just like New Kent.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.719" offset="1650291">We have free transfer out of the zones at that time and in the fall of 1964, 27 Negro pupils after the plan had been operated for two long years, these 27 Negro pupils intervene in the case, complaining that they have been denied admission to White schools discriminatorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.685" offset="1738062">They also complained that the school zones were gerrymandered and they asked for faculty desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.111" offset="1759796">The District Court held the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.098" offset="1767737">It took evidence and lasting several days to file an issue and opinion of an order in the summer of 1965 and that's what this comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.355" offset="1804831">And in that opinion, the district judge held that indeed the School Board was disobeying his prior order that they were discriminating in the transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.615" offset="1845791">He thought that the disobedience of his order was so egregious that he ordered counsel fees on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.799" offset="1874526">What the School Board was doing according to his finding was that any White child who lived in a Negro zone was permitted to transfer to go to a White school and 100% of the White children did just that during those three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.630" offset="1929906">Every White child who was zoned into the Negro areas still went to the White school but the Negro children in those same neighborhoods were required by the School Board to stay in Negro school and this was two years after this Court condemned such an arrangement in Goss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.419" offset="2001063">The Jackson, Tennessee School Board was still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.705" offset="2014229">The district judge also ruled that the school zones for the elementary schools, eight elementary schools, five White and three Negroes were gerrymandered racial and that finding by the district judge was followed elaborate presentation of evidence, with diagrams and maps and expert testimony by school educators and the district judge found that the elementary zones were gerrymandered.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.515" offset="2153409">Now, the Court rejected the plaintiff's argument about gerrymandering of the junior high school zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.445" offset="2201161">I'm going to -- I think the trial judge made plain in his opinion however that the basic position which guided his decision of these gerrymandering issues and the zoning issues was a view of a law that he thought primarily a legal question was involved and this is as to what sort of a standard he should use in looking at the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.903" offset="2307009">Now petitioners had two school administrators, two school superintendents as expert witnesses to make a study of the zone lines and the attendance pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.237" offset="2356328">And they prepared a number of exhibits which we were not able to print but we have reproduced one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.415" offset="2385063">It's the exhibit in the blue folder.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.979" offset="2399274">We reproduced photographically a copy of I think the most important exhibit and what -- the exhibit you have in the blue folder is the small copy of the exhibit I have on the aisle, the one on the aisle is just an enlargement of the little one.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.719" offset="2538245">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.866" offset="2554859">Now, if you -- the underlying map shows the City of Jackson and if you spread the red dots over, the City that White -- these dots represent the White junior high school children in the city and what the picture shows that they're spread all over the city generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.847" offset="2654751">They're distributed throughout Jackson.</text>

            <text syncTime="644.684" offset="2682128">If you remove that for a moment and spread the blue dots over, you can see that the Negroes in Jackson, Tennessee are distributed more or less in the center of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.864" offset="2758823">Now, with -- starting with that situation, the School Board built three junior high schools, all sets the Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.238" offset="2800306">They built one junior high school in the western part of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.461" offset="2821204">They built one in the east and they built one in the center and they adopted and those three schools opened as two all White schools and one all Negro schools and they were establishments and such with all Negro faculties in the Merry Junior High school in the side of the Negro school and the other two schools were established as all White schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.144" offset="2915976">In 1965 when the Board was ordered to desegregate junior high schools, it proposed these school zones indicated by the green lines so that's the green lines over the blue dots for a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.424" offset="5873037">The trial judge looked at the zones and he thought and this is from his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.845" offset="5898742">He thought fair discretion in drawing zone should not be overwritten unless it constitutes a clearer abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.251" offset="5944404">In other words, a quick thought, he thought he was required to approve any arrangements that the School Boards made as long as they weren't obviously phony -- obvious trait to preserve segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.712" offset="5994245">Whereas, we submit that the proper inquiry is for the judge to look at what is the most reasonable way consistent with maintaining an effective educational program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.184" offset="6036146">What's the most reasonable way for dismantling the dual system and for eliminating segregation and that if district judge has made that inquiry, we would get a substantially different results in these communities.</text>

            <label>Mr. Russell Rice</label>
            <text syncTime="1509.665" offset="6141994">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.005" offset="6163414">It was interesting to me to listen to Mr. Nabrit and to realize the changes that can occur something by the way that it is placed in the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.043" offset="6211584">The trial judge in the Jackson, Tennessee case granted summary judgment in June of 1963, the latter part of June.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.216" offset="6248260">A brand new School Board took office, July 1, 1963 and a brand new city attorney took the job on July 1st of that same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.474" offset="6297266">The first thing that was handed to me when I went in there was what to do about this school summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.137" offset="6327881">And what they did do is upon my recommendation and I do in a way wait to receive the motives of the School Board in myself impugned with an absolute barren record of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.964" offset="6379186">We did the very best that we could do to meet the requirements of the Brown decisions in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.080" offset="6403741">And I'm going to show it to the Court I think some of the differences that exist between what we actually did and the way that it has been stated here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.979" offset="6443238">First of all, I must agree that I have never read the Brown decisions as being a command for racial mixing as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.816" offset="6478660">As I read on Brown, this Court said, stop segregation -- compulsory segregation and establish a system of admissions to new schools based on some other factor than race and we've done that in Jackson, Tennessee in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.053" offset="6547623">Now, this Exhibit 5 which has been handed to you purported to be the residence of people that live in a zone, that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.516" offset="6601435">The residence of the people that live in these zones appear upon this large Exhibit 11, what you have here is a study of who attended certain schools and it appeared -- their residence appears upon here but the residence of all the other people living there do not appear here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.676" offset="6694118">Now, the initial decision of our trial judge allowed those children attending the school to continue in that school until graduation regardless of where they lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.391" offset="6740929">Secondly, the transfer provision was allowed and thirdly, those who lived in that zone had the uncontested right to go to that school if they wished to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.522" offset="6785442">After all three of those provisions had been applied and the student body had assembled for the school year after transferring, after exercising their right to remain if they had been attending and those who lived in that zone were going there, that is what appears here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.540" offset="6861511">It does not show you the residence of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.282" offset="6872482">It shows you who went to that school after all three of these factors had been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.398" offset="6896933">So as far as zoning is concerned, it shows this Court nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.492" offset="11921324">There was an article on that very question in the New York Times, March 24th which was an analysis of that type of problem by some west coast sociologist and it had so much sense in it and those people understand what we have against it -- so thorough that I had it reproduced and it is in a supplement to this rather voluminous appendix which I filed here.</text>
