            <text syncTime="45.639" offset="285968">Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.615" offset="297880">This is a direct appeal taken by the United States from the District Court in Connecticut, dismissing a kidnapping indictment returned against the three appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.558" offset="361618">An indictment which alleged among other things that the victim had not been liberated unharmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.155" offset="395995">The ground of the Court's dismissal is that the penalty provisions of the Kidnapping Act operate in a way that creates an inducement to waive the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.680" offset="486066">The District Court analogized this case to Griffin against California, stating that the scheme made the assertion of the constitutional right foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.979" offset="539251">Now, the penalty provisions of the Kidnapping Act appear at page 2 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.821" offset="566627">And you will note that they provide for a punishment, one by that, if the kidnapped person has not been liberated unharmed and if the jury shall so recommend.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.166" offset="636008">Or two, by imprisonment for any term of years or for life if the death penalty is not enclosed, after corresponding from that, that a jury recommendation is a precondition to imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.662" offset="722004">The district judge was of the further view that a jury recommendation of the death penalty would be binding upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.059" offset="767561">Now, in that, we do not agree with his conclusion for our reasons which I shall develop later.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.894" offset="798908">But first I propose to go on, if I may, and to indicate the reasoning to which this conclusion led him.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.607" offset="845824">His next step was to conclude that the hazard, the hazard that the jury might make such a binding determination would tend or might tend to induce the defendant to avoid the jury trial, either by seeking to waive that right or by pleading guilty to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.380" offset="948851">Now, Judge Timbers, the district judge, of course recognized that a waiver of jury trial depends upon the consent of the Government and the approval of the Court, and also, that the Court may refuse to accept a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.885" offset="1030875">He also recognized that a number of federal judges in cases arising under this Act and also in cases arising under the somewhat similar provisions feeling with aggravated bank robbery have in fact convened a jury to consider the circumstances of the offense and to make a recommendation as to punishment in circumstances where the Court has allowed a waiver of jury trial or accepted the plea of guilty, in other words, they have convened the jury solely on the issue of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.437" offset="1217076">And parenthetically, I might note that we made a check of records of the Bureau of Prisons and the relevant case files of the Department of Justice as to the number of death sentences which were finally imposed in cases arising under the kidnapping statute and under the similar provisions of the Bank Robbery Act, both statutes which have been on -- both statutes are on the books for approximately 30 odd years.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.930" offset="1347062">And there were 10 such cases that we found.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.614" offset="1365870">In five of these 10 cases, the judge had accepted a guilty plea and then had convened a jury on the issue of punishment alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.061" offset="3263613">That under this statute, a fair reading would permit the Court to hold and we think it's the desirable as well as the permissible interpretation that the judge is not bound by the jury recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.878" offset="3326934">And perhaps, I should go immediately to the reasoning on which we suggest that you're not bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.339" offset="3364760">Getting back to the statute itself, the appellees rely upon the fact that it uses the language “shall be punished”.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.888" offset="3406973">We think that that's a very limited force because you will note that the language shall be punished, precedes both alternatives: One, by death if the jury so recommends or; two, by imprisonment if the death penalty is not imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.928" offset="3495058">And so it seems to us that the language standing alone seems only to compel the conclusion that he shall be punished by one of the two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.755" offset="3542392">And of course, this statute, in the first numbered clause is as if the verdict of the jury shall so recommend and the normal connotation of recommend is that it is a recommendation and not a mandate.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.269" offset="3664436">That's certainly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.422" offset="3673109">Now, there are three additional considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.659" offset="3685961">I assume that the statue is equivocal here and both sides, I think are agreed that the legislative history does not in likeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.791" offset="3730578">There had been a variety of proposals made as to provisions for sentencing under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.136" offset="3767881">Some have favored a mandatory death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.642" offset="3781987">Some had favored a provision not on like that in the federal murder statute that the penalty shall be death unless the jury qualifies its verdict by recommending otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.951" offset="3831202">Some have been opposed to the death penalty altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.510" offset="3845413">This provision of the penalty might only be imposed if recommended by the jury was the ultimate compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.762" offset="3878431">And there is no indication that we've been able to find on either side of this case that judge from the briefs, that any of the congressmen focused on the question, what if the judge doesn't agree with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.027" offset="3947499">Now, we rely upon three considerations, I say, in support of our reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.031" offset="3979473">The first of these is that in the federal system, it's certainly has been a tradition, I think a well unbroken tradition that the judge is the final arbiter of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.571" offset="4025657">As Justice Brennan indicated a moment ago in the federal system, it's the judge who imposes the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.249" offset="4052407">Under the federal rules it is the judge who passes on any motion to reduce sentence and who has considerable discretion subject only to the situation where Congress has explicitly provided some mandatory minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.507" offset="4125445">And I think the Congress was presumably aware of this tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.579" offset="4153657">Secondly, we refer to what this Court has called the principle or Rule of Lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.090" offset="4183751">Namely that where a criminal statute is equivocal, the Court will adopt the less harsh of two alternatives, and certainly, a rule which permits the judge to mitigate the penalty is the less harsh rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.662" offset="4278000">Third, we say that if the concept that the jury's recommendation is mandatory as Judge Timbers has concluded creates serious constitutional doubts, then it would seem to us further that the precept of the statute should be read where possible to avoid those doubts comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.943" offset="4403179">Now, under our view of the statute, as I think I indicated earlier, there is no significant disparity of risk or as we view it a serious basis any longer for a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.467" offset="4481233">If the defendant goes to trial before a jury on the issue of guilt, then under our view, the concurrence of both judge and jury is required before a capital penalty can be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.301" offset="4548524">If on the other hand, he seeks to waive jury trial or plead guilty, the judge may reject that proposed waiver or plea, or if he accepts it, he may convene a jury on the issue of punishment as both federal and state judges have in the past done in these or comparable circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.841" offset="4654686">So again, the capital penalty may be imposed if, but only if, jury and judge concur in that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.070" offset="4703692">Now, it may be argued that a judge, who would perhaps be inclined to follow a jury's recommendation of a death penalty, if one were made by a jury which heard the issue of guilt, might not be inclined to convene a jury if there were no jury trial on the issue of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.191" offset="4812152">It seems to us that the answer to that is that the judge who would be inclined to concur in a death verdict, if one were recommended to him, would certainly regarded as his duty to have the matter go to a jury and to obtain a recommendation of which of course, he could readily accomplish either by insisting that the jury provide the question of guilt or by convening a jury on the issue of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.644" offset="4945899">Now, let me also suggest that if Judge Timbers were thought to be correct in holding if he did, first, that the jury's recommendation is more than a recommendation that it's binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.622" offset="5009847">And second, that this creates a serious disparity of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.327" offset="5024684">It still would not follow that the statute must be struck down either in whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.722" offset="5062301">Or if one does make the assumption that Congress intended the jury to be the sole determinant of the question of punishment without any role for the judge whatever, then it would seem to follow in our view that the trial judge in order to implement Congress' purpose should either refuse a plea or refuse to accept a proposed waiver of jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.235" offset="5172328">Or in every instance where he does accept it, convene a jury on the issue of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.247" offset="5196361">That incidentally is accomplished by statute or by decision in some states --</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.024" offset="5495515">Now, in making this point, I am not retreating from our suggestion that the statute should not be read as making the jury recommendation binding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.861" offset="5906787">It's quite unlikely in the circumstances of this case that any jury would impose such penalty because as the Badillo particularly shows the harm which was known to the dictum in this kidnapping case is very minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.358" offset="5960808">What we're dealing here -- we're dealing with here is not what is apt in fact to occur in this particular case but rather of course with a holding by a district judge that the entire statutory scheme breaks down and the statutes unconstitutional because of the penalty provisions which are written into the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.419" offset="6061014">Now, there's just one final respect in which I think the district judge's decision is unquestionably involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.191" offset="6104168">If everything I have said thus far should be rejected, and if you should conclude that the provision authorizing the imposition of the death penalty on recommendation of the jury is unconstitutional on any view of the matter, it still would not follow that the entire statute should be held unconstitutional in the indictment there under dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.547" offset="6225586">It would follow I think only that the clause authorizing the imposition of the death penalty would go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.582" offset="6257664">I think that it's hard to imagine a clearer case for severability than this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.130" offset="6283891">Congress, as Your Honors, well know passed the Lindbergh Law in 1932 because if in the contrary, we're greatly concerned by the shocking incidents which had occurred and there had been a general recognition that there were strong if not imperative reasons for making interstate kidnappings a federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.586" offset="6381693">The state lines, it was believed that it proved a serious obstacle to effective investigation and prosecution of kidnappings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.140" offset="6415966">Now, as originally enacted in 1932, the maximum penalty under this statute was life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.486" offset="6453269">Then two years later, in 1934 there were some minor amendments to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.324" offset="6484720">Its basic thrust remained entirely unchanged and that's graphically shown to the Court I think by merely examining the provisions as they stood in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.231" offset="6532263">And in 1934, we've set them out in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.742" offset="6554311">Now, one of these changes was the change which authorized on jury recommendation, the imposition of the capital penalty in the aggravated kidnapping case that in which the victim was liberated harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.477" offset="6621288">As I say, the thrust of the Act remained quite unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.264" offset="6636440">And it seems to us almost inconceivable that one could seriously argue that this 1934 Congress had it in face with the choice of not adding the provision authorizing the death penalty in aggravated cases or of abandoning the entire Act would have chosen the latter course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.913" offset="6743019">And as I say, this is a classic case for severability, the Act stands as a complete and an operative whole with or without this authorization of the death penalty in the aggravated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.015" offset="6803414">Consequently, the infirmity, if there'd be any, which we dispute in the capital penalty clause, obviously does not require the frustration of Congress' very plain and very resolute purpose to make interstate kidnapping a federal crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.649" offset="6897977">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven B. Duke</label>
            <text syncTime="1706.075" offset="6927653">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.565" offset="6945625">I would first like to make it clear in connection with the question asked by Mr. Justice Brennan that our position quite adequately and quite positively is that even if all the positions of statutory construction urged upon the Court by the Government are accepted, the statute can still plainly invalid and I will attempt to develop that at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.920" offset="7067042">Preliminarily on some of the statutory interpretation points, we first would like to urge the language of the statute which says that the death penalty shall be imposed -- shall be imposed -- the words are the defendant shall be punished by death if the kidnapped person has not been liberated unharmed and if the verdict of the jury shall so recommend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.325" offset="7208626">Now, we think the words if the verdict of the jury refers in their plainness sense when viewed in context to a body of man to decide guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.324" offset="7260662">The word verdict itself was defined by Webster as the decision of a jury on the matter submitted on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.242" offset="7296293">And the statute itself refers to the jury, not a jury, the jury, do you think Congress pretty clearly had in mind the 12 people that decide guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.460" offset="7341223">That is where the statute puts the sole authority to impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.018" offset="7371421">Thus, it's our point that the statute forbids any death penalty imposed by anybody other than the 12 men who decide guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.843" offset="7418755">In other words, no one can receive the death penalty without claiming jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.944" offset="7447176">He does claim a jury trial or he doesn't perceive a jury trial, he cannot perceive the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.333" offset="7476746">Now surely, the contrary argument can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.325" offset="7496704">The Government makes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.336" offset="7504750">They make the argument in the interest of humane construction but if the Government's argument is an intention -- an effort to extend and broaden the scope of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.637" offset="7577893">The plain words of the statute authorize the death penalty only in a very limited number of cases namely those of which there's a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.200" offset="7616136">The Government ask this Court to do is to decide that notwithstanding that there is no clear expression in the statute, a death penalty should be permissible even when a man pleads guilty whether or not, he gets the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.740" offset="7690324">Now, we think there is a sound principle that competes against the contention that vagueness should be construed in favor of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.585" offset="7745703">That principle is the one applied in Kent against Dulles namely that when constitutionally protected rights are involved, these rights are not curved by vague language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.318" offset="7804635">If the Congress is going to curve constitutionally protected rights, they must do so clearly and explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.253" offset="7836400">In Kent against Dulles, the constitutionally protected rights were the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.827" offset="7858657">Here, the right cannot be over emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.035" offset="7871509">The right involved here is the right to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.523" offset="7885511">And surely, the right to life, this is entitled to application of Kent against Dulles as the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.903" offset="7923022">In short, the humane construction of this statute is to take it no further than these words require to limit the death penalty only to cases in which there has been trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.899" offset="7974954">Given that interpretation, there's no issue as I understand that above the invalidity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.965" offset="8007241">That is the way where the statute means is plainly invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.387" offset="8028871">Now, on the issue of the mandatoriness of the death penalty when --</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.102" offset="8815783">Well, that sounds as if the jury is the body that makes the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.393" offset="8836995">I would also refer the Court to Winston against the United States decided by this Court in 1899 in which the Court said in connection with the murder statute, that the decision of life or death is put by Congress solely and exclusively in the lap of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.551" offset="8917556">Indeed, that decision indicated that it would be improper for the trial judge even to instruct on the criteria which the jury should employ in deciding the penalty question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2546.629" offset="10289925">That is the alternative construction that the Government offers in order to save the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.797" offset="10310510">Namely, the one of that several attorneys, namely give the judge the power to impanel a penalty jury in all cases; guilty plea cases, jury waive cases, in other words, to eliminate any absolute waive whereby the defendant might avoid the jury trial on the penalty issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.915" offset="10402983">Now, our contention is and the decision -- the judge below decided that even that, that that is a reasonable construction of the statute it doesn't say it because the judge has complete discretion in deciding whether or not to impanel a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.761" offset="10490441">He doesn't have that discretion when there's a trial by jury, trial of guilt or innocence at least under our reading of the statute or under such case where there is he must submit it to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.305" offset="10544567">But even if we're wrong on that, that is even if he has -- the judge, has complete discretion in all cases to submit it to the jury or not to submit to the jury, then we get down to the point that I began with, and that Mr. Justice Brennan raised, namely, is there any constitutional question left?</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.265" offset="10652400">And if I can state it very simply, the reason is, the two very different procedures are set up to determine the death penalty, to determine whether the man lives or dies, and whether one procedure or the other procedure applies to the defendant turns on whether or not he waives or claims a jury trial on guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.235" offset="10752293">And I submit that that's an unconstitutional burden on what should be a free choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.015" offset="12383483">There was nothing so far as we've been able to uncover in 1934 regarding a penalty jury in federal criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.817" offset="12414621">And it's -- even today, it's a very seldom used procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.875" offset="12438862">What criteria does the judge used to determine qualifications of the jurors?</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.010" offset="12463417">What kind of procedure does he use to determine penalty?</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.202" offset="12476165">All these uncertainties weigh against his affirmative calling in of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.240" offset="12504377">Secondly, he offsets the expectations of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.542" offset="12517543">The defendant presumably expects the judge will accept the guilty plea and not invoke a penalty jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.906" offset="12554951">He will upset those expectations and produce possibly a motion for withdrawal if he does call in a penalty jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.817" offset="12610644">Another factor against the probability that a penalty jury will be impaneled is that the judge makes his decision without any benefit, of any gruesome facts, or any tearful witnesses, he does it on the cold record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.968" offset="12683264">In short, it would be a very strong and determined and unusual judge who would impanel a death penalty jury after a guilty plea if it was in his discretion to do otherwise.</text>
