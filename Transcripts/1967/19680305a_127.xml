            <text syncTime="26.151" offset="208018">I would like, if I may, to enter two questions which were asked by Mr. White yesterday, by members of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.252" offset="236335">Mr. Justice Black asked how the fire started.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.539" offset="253576">On the record, this is a fire of undetermined origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.798" offset="270608">For the purposes of this argument we of course have admitted negligence of the receiver but it's a fire of undetermined origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.914" offset="307075">Mr. Chief Justice, you asked whether and about the availability of the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.858" offset="326823">The bond is a performance bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.457" offset="333197">It is available, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.231" offset="340302">Its amount doesn't meet the enormous claims here.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.268" offset="368410">This matter would be here no matter what the amount, I believe, because we feel so strongly that this claim, an unliquidated claim for property damages, arising from a negligence a receiver during a Chapter XI proceeding is not entitled to the first status priority which claimants seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.794" offset="478542">As Your Honors have said in recent cases, very recent cases, where a priority is sought, the burden on the claimant is a very heavy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.992" offset="543326">And may I quote Your Honor's words in the case of Nathanson against the National Labor Relations Board in which this Court said the theme of the Bankruptcy Act is equality of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.832" offset="594735">And if one claimant is to be preferred over others, the purpose should be clear from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.405" offset="625037">We submit that there's no such clarity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.197" offset="640188">The Act is unim -- is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.218" offset="660250">If claimant is to succeed, he must concisely and convincingly bring the claim within Section 64, subsection (a) (1) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.994" offset="719391">That Act provides that cost and expenses of administration, including the actual and necessary cost and expenses of preserving the estate subsequent to the filing of the petition, are entitled a first priority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1513.399" offset="6156936">Also by statute in Chapter X reorganizations, Congress has made the equity receivership rules applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.320" offset="11148622">Not -- It was not until May, this fire occurred in January; that the company went into bankruptcy and we considered that by presenting this claim, we were doing the equivalent, starting a suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.119" offset="11251858">I do not sincerely believe we could possibly have a claim because for six weeks, he had been out of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.332" offset="11284668">He had no control whatever over what was done in that building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.953" offset="11303163">This was an engineer who was hired by the receiver and I do not see how we could hold the bankrupt responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.151" offset="11339943">Now, our claim was, as I say presented before the bankruptcy occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.932" offset="11367111">It has been expunged both as a general claim and as an administrative expense and we have -- we are now out of the bankruptcy proceeding unless the judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.345" offset="11420714">We just simply had no standing whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.851" offset="11434820">Now, as far as 63 (a) (7) is concerned, that appears at page 24 of our brief, this is the brief for petition and it says, “Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against this estate which are founded upon the following things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.216" offset="11540250">Now, if I am correct and I don't see how I can be wrong about the -- whether this is a claim against the bankrupt, if I am correct, then certainly, we have no claim under the Section 63 because this covers only “debts of the bankrupt”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.993" offset="11607333">Now the only other place we have to go is cost and expenses of administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.338" offset="11640769">For claims against the receiver which arise during the course of the arrangement or during the course of bankruptcy, and well I must confess that this action was started by my Brother, I didn't start this myself, and when I first heard that he had started a claim, this was expenses of administration, I had the same reaction that some of Your Honors have had to it that a $3,500,000 doesn't sound like an expense of administration.</text>
