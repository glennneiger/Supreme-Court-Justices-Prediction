            <label>Mr. George Kaufmann</label>
            <text syncTime="37.117" offset="251800">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.035" offset="263502">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alaska which have found the dismissal of petitioners as teachers in the public schools of Seward, Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.285" offset="308537">Both petitioners were active and a group of teachers who opposed policy of the school board and of its superintendent Mr. Fibricious (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="62.157" offset="352005">In March 1960, the school board notified petitioners that their contracts would not be renewed and advised them of their rights under the Teacher Tenure Law to a hearing and of the charges against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.858" offset="422849">After petitioners discharge was sustained within the state school system, they brought suit in the state courts to obtain judicial review of this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.328" offset="472691">After a lengthy litigation which included a summary reversal in this Court, the Supreme Court of Alaska on December 7, 1966 by 2:1 vote rendered the judgment now under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.910" offset="543013">The Court held that both petitioners were properly discharged because in May 1959 they prepared and circulated to the public what was called an open letter to the Seward School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.994" offset="607378">This letter was signed by the Seward local of the American Federation of Teachers, of which petitioner Blue was President and petitioner Watts was Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.883" offset="650951">The letter as reprinted is in appendix in the petitioner’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.119" offset="667878">It starts up by saying that it was the union’s way of informing the school board and the public and I quote, “Of our stand in the current struggle for a good school.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.306" offset="712600">We hold the incidents occurring during the last year have reached such proportions as to be definitely detrimental to morale of our teaching staff and the effectiveness of our educational system.”</text>
            <text syncTime="166.130" offset="767875">The letter then recited some of these incidents, most of which cited around the school Superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.725" offset="794311">Impairment of job security was the main theme of the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.984" offset="811342">The Superintendent had repeatedly threatened teachers with the loss of jobs and some teachers had already lost their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.650" offset="841958">The letter objected also that the administration created tension and friction in the school, teachers had been subjected to undignified treatment, the Fire regulations had been disregarded and discussed some other matters of perhaps less important.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.777" offset="902457">The union explained in its letter that the teachers had sought to resolve these problems privately, but that the school board had refused to meet with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.889" offset="942895">The letter therefore requested an immediate public meeting with the school board at which the union would press for substantial improvements and administrative policies and set forth certain specific demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.809" offset="1006634">At the hearing on their dismissal both petitioners testified that they had prepared the open letter because all other avenues of recourse within the school system had been blocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.753" offset="1066402">They felt the need to inform and solicit the support of the electorate to which the school board and the teachers were ultimately responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.244" offset="1112377">Now the discharge of petitioner Blue rests exclusively on his part in publishing this open letter to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.913" offset="1158980">But the Supreme Court of Alaska held against Watts for an additional reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.888" offset="1178937">The Court accepted a finding by the school board that Watts had met with two teachers Mr. and Mrs. (Inaudible) and now I quote the finding, “Ask them if they would go along with the group”, of which Watts was a representative whose purpose was to oust the Superintendent of Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.402" offset="1264933">The statutory basis for the Court’s ruling that Watts was subject to discharge for this conversation, was that this was immorality within the meaning of the Alaskan tenure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.674" offset="1318118">The Court construed immorality as including all conduct from the commission of the most highness felony down the scale of infamy to social misbehavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.847" offset="1370781">And to this definition the distribution of the open letter was also found to be immoral conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.224" offset="1396276">But the Court ruled further that the distribution of the open letter also violated a school board regulation which described the procedure for processing grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.458" offset="1445177">It is our position that it is authoritatively construed by the Supreme Court of Alaska, both the immorality provision of the statute and the regulation on which petitioner’s discharge is based were both hopelessly and unconstitutionally vague and that they were also unconstitutionally over broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.752" offset="1526366">We contend further that petitioner’s discharge violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.703" offset="1550190">A circular or open letter which discusses and criticizes the administration of the public schools contributes to debate on public issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.101" offset="1591777">Its publication is the exercise of Freedom of Speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.076" offset="1615705">An invitation to join a group was subjective as the oust of a public official is of the essence of the First Amendment Freedom of Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.211" offset="1656247">The central question presented by this case therefore is whether petitioners maybe discharged for the exercise of these First Amendment Rights because the public officials who were involved were their own superiors within the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.732" offset="1730330">The decisions of this Court make it clear that these First Amendment Rights do not exist for the sole benefit of those who exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.704" offset="1766170">They are essential to the wellbeing of a democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.767" offset="1782471">The public schools are not the exclusive domain of the school boards and school superintendents, they affect the entire community and are properly a subject of continuing public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.921" offset="1835029">We stress this point obvious though it is because the Court below and respondents in its brief have treated this case as it were simply a contest between these petitioners and the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.699" offset="1894170">We think that even on this narrow view, petitioners would be entitled to prevail, because this Court has now discredited the document, that public employees maybe forced to abandon either their jobs or their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.651" offset="1958013">But the decision below is erroneous for the more fundamental reason that it fails to take into account the strong public interest in the availability of information regarding the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.845" offset="2026768">In New York Times against Sullivan this Court sharply circumscribed the permissible scope of liable actions brought by public officials against their critics.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.155" offset="2072012">The basis of this decisions, we understand was that the fear of damage of wards would cause even good faith critics to withhold their criticism and would thereby deafen the vigor of public debate, contrary to the central policy in the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.970" offset="2147244">And we submit self censorship by public employees because they feel the loss of their jobs is equally destructive of the values inherent in the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.113" offset="2195832">Mr. Blue had taught at the Public Schools of Alaska for 15 years before he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.151" offset="2219969">Mr. Watts had taught for eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.000" offset="2231359">With their example, before that no teachers would have the temerity to risk the same fate by voicing any public objection to the actions of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.625" offset="2285902">To affirm the judgment below would not only penalize petitioners for the exercise of their First Amendment rights, it would cut off from the multitude of times a discussion of issues affecting the public schools, teachers who have a particular information, insight and training which can make -- which enables them to make a substantial and unique contribution to their discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.545" offset="2405543">Now for these reasons, we submit that the laws, the discharge of these petitioners would substantially interfere with the objectives of First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.720" offset="2466252">But we recognize also that this Court has refused to give dogmatic approval to every exercise of First Amendment rights regardless of its consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.679" offset="2510137">And we therefore do not contend that public employee may never be disciplined where his exercise of First Amendment rights is directed against his own superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.849" offset="2558725">That is we can envision that some situation would arise in which the kind of activities which involve in this case might have such a serious impact on the morale and discipline of the public school system or with regard to other public employees, to the administration of government generally, that there would be the kind of an overriding public interest, which might justify the subordination of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.659" offset="2694040">But the principle that this Court has established is that the First Amendment right is entitled to prevail, unless the state can show a subordinating interest which is compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.319" offset="2752658">And the formulation that we think is particularly analogous to this case is that Wood against Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.771" offset="2790484">In Wood, it was decided that public criticism of the judge maybe punish this contemptuous only if the Court can show and I quote in Your Honor’s opinion, “A substantive evil actually designed to impede the courts of justice”.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.293" offset="2860596">Now we submit that where the claim is made, as it is by respondents in this case that the First Amendment right should be held before in the interest of the administration, some other branch of government than the administration of justice by the Courts the same formulation should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.743" offset="2954324">And we submit that the school board has not come close to showing that petitioners created a substantive evil actually designed to interfere with the operation of the schools, or has it demonstrated to injury to any other legitimate overriding interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="728.993" offset="3019316">I would invite Your Honor’s attention to page 66 of the Appendix, which is reprinted in the footnote of page 38 of our brief, where the Court below described what it considered to be the interest that would justify the discharge of petitioners for circulating the open letter, here is what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.336" offset="3124746">The overall binding effect of the widespread circulation of the false statements and the highhanded method employed to seek redress and disregard of established procedures could only result in a loss of respect by the public for appellants and the teaching profession in general, when all of the facts became known and was immoral conduct within the meaning of that term as it was then defined by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.421" offset="3325053">Now, I say as if the Court -- as it was then defined by statute because after the Supreme Court of Alaska’s first step decision in this case, the Supreme Court of Alaska that the legislature of Alaska thought so ill of that interpretation that they changed the law and that was why the case was originally reversed by this Court to give the Supreme of Alaska a chance to decide whether to give retroactive effect to that new legislation, of course the Supreme Court of Alaska preferred not to give it retroactive effect when that argument was heard.</text>

            <label>Mr. George Kaufmann</label>
            <text syncTime="846.164" offset="3488057">There is a finding by the school, in the findings which are appendix B to our brief, in which they make a finding that there was -- that six of the statements in the open letter were false.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.009" offset="3559424">It’s said in respondent’s brief that all but one of the statements was false, I think that was just an oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.003" offset="3595368">We urge in an appendix to our reply brief, the green brief, that as a matter of fact these statements were not false, but some of them were mere expressions of opinion, that to some extent the Court had -- the school board simply misinterpreted the letter, but it’s our basic position that the principle of the New York Times -- of the New York Times case, that truth is not the test and the petitioner’s testified and it’s pages at 190 and 219 of the record and it’s reprinted in the footnote of page 31 of our brief and it is not challenged here, the petitioners testified that they believed in good faith that everything that was said in that open letter was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.107" offset="3799751">We believe that the same test that the New York Times case is applicable here because if under these conditions and I think the same thing is involved in the next case, the school board can make a determination that the statements are false, you are going to cut it off the debate the same way --</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.475" offset="4189288">The Supreme Court of Alaska did base its decision on the regulation and let me address myself to that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.492" offset="4217292">It is our position first that the application of that regulation is itself in violation of the First Amendment because it creates in effect a prior censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.377" offset="4268910">What it is, is a situation in which the public official who is being criticized is saying to the respective critic, we will decide when you can go to the public and we believe that the interest of the public in having the information is superior to allowing any public official in the normal situation unless there is a particular reason for giving this opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.749" offset="4390327">Now the only kind of case that we can envision in which there would be a justification for this kind of a regulation is that in order to allow these matters actually be discussed and to be worked out on an internal level before going to the public, we think that it maybe that this kind of a regulation would be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.348" offset="4504743">Now the facts in this case are that in the first place there were no clear regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.434" offset="4533060">We have reprinted as appendix C of our opening brief, two regulations both of which deal with the subject of the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.946" offset="4575169">But we take the position that they are hopelessly inconsistent, the dissenting judge at pages 102 of the Appendix took the same position, the superintendent who testified as to their meaning was unable to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.242" offset="4648312">Now we think the least that’s necessary if the purpose of this kind of a regulation is to be accomplished is that the people know, not only the school board and the teachers, everybody know that this is what you do and then we’ll talk about it and then after that you can go to the public.

            <text syncTime="3145.968" offset="12687235">Yes, or certain actions of the superintendent, they were complaining about actions of the superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.060" offset="12707610">For instance, that he hadn't held enough fire drills which he admitted it was true, but it wasn't brought to his attention first, they just took it directly to the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.232" offset="12752332">Now I submit that's the kind of thing that he had a right to know and remedy, perhaps he didn't know that he hadn't had enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.538" offset="12781484">I mean this is the kind of thing and that's why this is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.475" offset="12801233">But on this question of the arguments been made on the question of over breadth, I'd like to point out that these are statutes and the statute regulations have been attacked on the grounds over breadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.680" offset="12850134">I submit that that is not applicable to this type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.132" offset="12867897">It's applicable to the type of statute that says if you're a member, the communist party you can't be employed by the state, these have been struck down on grounds that the decision of whether being a member of communist party is good or bad has been made by the legislator without any subjective investigation so that all that's left to the administrative party in applying this standard is was he or was he not a member of the communist party?</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.685" offset="12978134">Did he or did he not do this particular conduct and if in fact being a member of the communist party in all cases is not grounds for disbarment or whatever then it's no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.579" offset="13021706">And that's where the overbroad argument applies but where you have a catch-all type of statute or regulation as we do here and where the determination of adjudicating board is to consider all the facts and then determine subject to review whether certain acts fall in the definition of prescribed conduct, it's a different situation and in fact this is a kind of the statute you have with the bar statutes on Schware and (Inaudible) where they say a good moral character and these cases, these denials of admission have been overturned by this Court and if the statute stands because the standard is all right it's just in that particular case it wasn't applied right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.529" offset="13213445">It's a broad standard and the bar association has the job of determining if it applies in this particular case and that's the kind of situation we have here with the Alaska Supreme Court by the standard that it did apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.099" offset="13275721">But even though they said in certain cases it's unconstitutional as application, the Supreme Court of Alaska said this how -- that doesn't mean the whole statute is bad because any statute is the words, the power of contempt of a court which has been held by this Court in many instances to have exceeded the constitutional limits is nevertheless still there, it isn't destroyed because in some circumstances it can be unconstitutionally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.760" offset="13390451">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. George Kaufmann</label>
            <text syncTime="3329.202" offset="13420231">Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to us that the basic issue in this case is whether and I think it's been granted, it wouldn't be unfair but I think it has been granted that we are dealing here with the exercise of the First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.363" offset="13500792">The question under this Court's decision is whether there's an overriding state interest which justifies subordinating them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.164" offset="13540080">Now I submit that the interest of the school board in knowing in advance, what the grievances are justice as it was stated here does not override under our constitution, the interest of the public of what's going on in its school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.572" offset="13625657">So it seems to me that the interest which was asserted is an insufficient one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.749" offset="13646346">I can imagine a situation in which it ordered they have an opportunity to work these things out inside internally first, it would be insisted that this kind of a procedure if it was known to be available and if it was available should be followed first because the public also has an interest in having these things worked out if it all possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.072" offset="13751672">Now it was said that it was -- it has been said here that it was the objective of these people throughout to get rid of the superintendent and that this is why they circulated the open letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.218" offset="13804231">Now there is considerable testimony in this record that the only reason that they published this open letter at the time they did was because the whole process of internal communication had broken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.116" offset="13863790">And I'd like to read to Your Honor just one colloquy on this, was a testimony of Mr. Blue and there is no finding, nothing to the contrary anywhere in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.152" offset="13911960">“You did in fact”, this is a question of Mr. Burn, “You did in,” this is at 467 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.562" offset="13937664">“You did in fact publish a statement about Mr. Fibricious (ph) without bringing the matter to his attention first.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.748" offset="13962324">“I participated,” Mr. Blue, “I participated in the preparation, publication and distribution of this document, part of which I helped to prepare, part of which others prepared, it was all prepared as far as we can determine in a truthful manner and it was an open and that didn't last -- merely a last resort to resolve a very serious problem that affected the lives of a great many people and which already had the town in furor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.165" offset="14076008">Now it was said that it was -- the town was in the furor and counsel for respondents said well this is a reason why they shouldn't have done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.897" offset="14122924">As we understand the First Amendment that's one of its objectives and one of its consequences, to have public debate on issues of public importance and this very public furor shows that in this town of Seward Alaska, the operation and administration of their public schools was important.</text>

            <text syncTime="3678.286" offset="14816528">But it seems to us that while there maybe situations to which references made here were if a man campaigns against his own superior that this would have such an impact on the moral and discipline that you shouldn't commit it, there may be that kind of a situation and the findings and determinations of this statute by the Court below, this was not an adequate basis and furthermore that the statute be a morality statute so obviously unconstitutional that it can't justify the discharge opinion.</text>
