            <label>Mr. Samuel W. Tucker</label>
            <text syncTime="23.494" offset="197360">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.865" offset="210840">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.204" offset="228185">The case involves the public schools of New Kent County, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.615" offset="245844">There are but two such schools, each with its elementary and high school department serving grades 1 through 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.906" offset="274996">There is no residential segregation in New Kent County.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.337" offset="288684">White families and Negro families live in every part of the county, yet three years ago no child of either race have been brought into contact with persons of the other race as a part of his normal daily public school experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.484" offset="345318">In March of 1956 when this action was commenced, some 739 Negro children attended George Watkins located in the western half of the county, and some 522 white children attended New Kent School located in the eastern half of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.249" offset="412400">18 Indian children living in New Kent County were transported by public school to Sumari Indian School in adjoining Charles City County.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.521" offset="445419">For more than ten years, the county school board of New Kent has simply ignored this Court decision in school segregation cases and we submit they had no intention of complying unless required.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.295" offset="488573">Negro citizens of the county petitioned the school board to end racial segregation in the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.451" offset="509158">They too were ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.692" offset="518144">On March 15, 1965, 36 Negro school children and their parents brought this class action in the eastern district of Virginia praying that the school board be required to adopt and forthwith implement a plan which will provide for the prompt and efficient elimination of racial segregation in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.806" offset="602572">This action so far as its heading, brought in a result, be as well have been ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.959" offset="627231">On June 1, 1965 when the defendants answered, they said in effect that the school board has no due to the desegregate the schools and if any Negro parent was unhappy about the attendance of his child at the Watkins School, you need only to apply to the Virginia People Placement Board for transfer of the child to the New Kent School.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.863" offset="702777">Such -- and such is the board's position today, except for the fact that the board has reassumed irresponsibility of assignment and transfers, and the further fact of the State People Placement Board no longer exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.008" offset="755440">After the school board -- the school officials had filed their answer, they found themselves faced, as many school boards around the country, are faced with the threat of loosing federal funds under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.518" offset="809462">So, like most of the school boards in the south, the New Kent board on August 2, 1965 while the litigation was pending, adopted what was basically a standard freedom of choice plan meeting what were then the minimum requirements of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.164" offset="876022">Essentially, this meant that any child or his parents could only before May 31 of any year choose whether the child would attend the New Kent School or the Watkins School.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.603" offset="917817">Now of course the predictable practicality of the adoption of the freedom of choice plan was that no white parent was going to choose for his child to attend the Watkins School, and only the more aggressive Negro parents would risk their child being an unwanted intruder at the New Kent School.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.329" offset="1004648">On June 28, 1966 the District Court approved the plan as supplemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.118" offset="1023875">There were some additions to provide for faculty desegregation which did not come in effect however the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.710" offset="1050206">The case was retained on the docket with the lead to either pardon or to seek further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.033" offset="1067551">The court's memorandum noting that it may be necessary, or may become necessary to revoke in full or in part the approval which the court had given the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.287" offset="1108511">But meanwhile, 35 Negro children had broken tradition by enrolling in the New Kent School in the fall of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.421" offset="1145083">On appeal by the plaintiffs, this case was, and the case against the county school board of Charles City County, it was Bowman or Cole, were argued in the Fourth Circuit on January 9, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.133" offset="1207881">And at that time, some 111 Negro children had obtained assignments in New Kent School.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.120" offset="1231809">No white child was enrolled in Watkins School and no white person taught at Watkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.219" offset="1252289">One Negro teacher visited New Kent two days per week or the equivalent day.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.731" offset="1274337">Indian children were still being transported to Sumari School over in Charles City County at all times before.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.094" offset="1299728">And today, the picture in New Kent is just slightly altered from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.872" offset="1314879">The Indian children are now, ten Indian children are now attend New Kent School.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.154" offset="1332015">Some 115 Negro children, an increase of four over the previous year, attend New Kent School, but 621 and that's 54% of the county's Negro school children attend Watkins School completely isolated from all of their white and Indian citizens except one white teacher who was assigned to Watkins School initially this year.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel W. Tucker</label>
            <text syncTime="351.350" offset="1508812">Of such are the facts 14 years after this Court concluded that in the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.142" offset="1539950">The Court of Appeals opinions were rendered on June 12, 1967, the basis for the decisions being in the Brown versus County School Board of Green County case.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.281" offset="1580492">The majority opinion by Chief Judge Hanesworth states what we consider two contradictory propositions which we feel this Court has to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.448" offset="1617168">First, the majority says and nobody would disagree with the abstract statement, that the burden of extracting individual pupils from discriminatory racial assignments may not be cast upon their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.975" offset="1671293">But, the holding of the majority is totally inconsistent with the abstract statement where they said that the school board may not be required to make compulsory assignments to achieve a greater intermixture of the races, or as is otherwise stated by the majority below, that the constitution does not require that he, the individual pupil, be deprived of his choice freely expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.604" offset="1777768">In sharp contrast with this holding, Judges Sobbeloff and Winter emphasized what we think the true constitutional imperative in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.266" offset="1812459">And that is the freedom of choice is not the sacred talisman, it is only a means to a constitutionally required in the abolition of the system of segregation and its effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.028" offset="1863450">Using as nearly as channeling which suggested by the respondents, we would state the issue here as in these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.666" offset="1889991">The county school board of New Kent County, Virginia has a constitutional duty immediately to assign children to each of the public schools so that children of all races will attend schools indiscriminately.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.586" offset="1945684">And in support of that, we argue two propositions, the Brown contemplated that this school system would long since have been converted into a unitary non-racial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.988" offset="1983300">And second, the freedom of choice in the context of this case is merely an impermissible expedient to evade the constitutional duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.641" offset="2021961">On May 17, 1954 this nation, indeed the entire world, was electrified by this Court's holding of the Negro children being segregated of the public schools, were being denied the equal protection of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.019" offset="2067414">A many Americans were jubilant.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.255" offset="2072430">Some were relieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.131" offset="2075878">Many were disappointed, but there were done who question what the Court meant when it decided that in the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.474" offset="2121226">From that point of departure, Americans have come to accept the demise of the doctrine of separate but equal in other areas, but it still lingers in the area in which this Court first pronounced it or pronounced its demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.053" offset="2171591">Having settled the basic issue, the Court then addressed to counsel and directs the re-argument upon two questions including a question for which posed two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.444" offset="2213177">(A) further decree would necessary to follow providing that within the limits set on normal geographic school districting, Negro children are forthwith be admitted to schools of their choice, or (B) might the Court in the exercise of its equate to powers permit an effective gradual adjustment to be brought about from existing segregate system to a system not based on colored distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.796" offset="2306591">Under respondents argue in their brief that the quandary that was faced in the court at that time was freedom of choice now or gradual progression to a system which would allow freedom of choice in some indefinite time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.773" offset="2362493">We do not so read the questions but in any event, this Court's 1955 resolution of its question number four said nothing about the choice of any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.467" offset="2401259">On the contrary, the Court directed that there be among other things, revision of school districts and attendance areas therein into compact units to achieve the system of determining admission to the public schools on a non-racial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.977" offset="2459251">It was obvious that such revision in large and complex school districts would require more time than would be required for a simple school district like New Kent County with two separate and equal schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.034" offset="2503555">Hence the court charged the District Courts to allow time when necessary, but the lower courts would ere to be bear in mind that the burden rests upon the defendants to establish that such time is necessary in the public interest in consistent with good faith compliance at the earliest practical date.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.913" offset="2563009">In New Kent County with two schools, it would be a simple matter to assign all children in the western part of the county to Watkins School, and all of the children in the eastern part of the county to New Kent School.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.321" offset="2604701">Or one school could've been made the elementary school and one school could've been made the high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.991" offset="2627375">Either these could've been done overnight and but for Virginia's infamous massive resistance, we say that the earliest practical date for compliance in New Kent County was the first day of school in the 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.764" offset="2690382">The respondents do not suggest in their brief or in any stage in these proceedings that there are or ever have been obstacles of administrative character to justify delay in making the transition.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.578" offset="2733641">On the contrary, they have deliberately selected the only available alternative, composite though it may be, by which segregation might continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.349" offset="2772720">This they admit where on pages 3 and 4 of their brief they say that their adoption of freedom of choice was designed to honor the educational imperative of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.280" offset="2812531">By that they meaning, that if they should desegregate both schools that white patrons would withdraw their children form the schools, from the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.319" offset="2848684">I think this suggestion was answered by the Court in 1955 when it said that it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles should not be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.108" offset="2899780">We think the answer was reaffirmed in 1958 when this Court considered the Liberrock case, Cooper versus Errand.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.081" offset="2923708">We think the same answer was reaffirmed in 1964 in the Prince Ebert County, Virginia case and we submit that on January 15, 1968 when this Court affirmed the tuition grant case from Louisiana that that was another answer -- sufficient answer to that threat or the possible to white persons might withdraw their children from the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.316" offset="3012629">We submit that in New Kent County, compliance with the Brown mandate is long overdue that the time for deliberate speed has long rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.681" offset="3050141">Freedom of choice in New Kent and in most places where it's been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.236" offset="3068322">It's just another expedient to avoid compliance with Brown mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.968" offset="3087235">If a residential segregation prevails, school boards wishing to retain segregated schools assign children to schools in accordance with their zones, school attendance there and thereby force the racial segregation of children in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.617" offset="3153795">Such a case before this Court in 1965 as suppose of summarily, Guilan versus School Board of the City of Hoopa.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.244" offset="3184306">Whereas here, residential segregation does not prevail, the school board pleads it should not force children to attend school with children of the other race.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.007" offset="3219414">Force is seen as normal government regulation when its use retains segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.915" offset="3239058">The school board seem to make it sound horrible when used with reference to putting children of both races into public schools together.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.051" offset="3271555">New Kent here appoints to dicta in the case from Atlanta, Georgia Kelton versus Latima and the case from Knoxville, Tennessee Gose versus Board of Education as justifying the adoption of freedom of choice in New Kent.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.091" offset="3327770">But those large metropolitan systems it seems to me the court could easily and could easily perceive and did perceive of valid reasons why persons would exercise their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.332" offset="3368730">Now the choice in a large system, it may be difference in curricular or other differences by which would validate a parent's choosing one school rather than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.242" offset="3404361">But in New Kent County, the only choice is a choice of the white school or the colored school.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.118" offset="3427871">And we submit that the state is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment to extend such choice to parents and thereby permit parents to accomplish the same thing that the state is forbidden to do and that is to racially segregate children in the public schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.728" offset="3918242">The circuit remanded the case to the District Court to do something more about faculty desegregation but we elected to bring the student assignment picture here.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.139" offset="3967979">The struggle to desegregate the general public schools is in its fourth stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.009" offset="3983444">For four years, 1955 through 1959, we had massive resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.761" offset="4002461">The next three years, 1959 through 1962, we had State Pupil Placement Board or local school boards rejecting the application of Negro children to attend white schools on a basis of criteria which would not apply in the -- to determine the admission of white children of those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.711" offset="4062229">That practice was struck down by the Fourth Circuit in May and in June 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.476" offset="4081246">Then for three years, 1962 through 1965, we had freedom of choice administered by the State Pupil Placement Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.044" offset="4107577">The Department of Health, Education and Welfare came to the picture effective of the fall of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.293" offset="4128580">Now the Department of Health, Education and Welfare is seeking to expand or to accelerate the desegregation of schools, but they can only require such speed as the judicial opinion seems to require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.968" offset="4191274">Today, the New Kent School Board says that if any of the inequalities that noted in the Brown decision managed to survive the Fourth Circuit striking down of the discriminatory criteria that they were clearly overcome and everything was made all right on August 2, 1965 as if by the wave of a magic wand when the New Kent School Board formally adopted the plan label freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.807" offset="4282598">They said that was all they have to do the schools -- by that act desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.088" offset="4299734">By its own resolution the claims to have become a neutral party without interest in and without responsible for the continuing struggle between those who want New Kent School desegregated -- to be segregated, and those who want every vestige of segregation to be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.730" offset="4366294">And these kinds of struggles are going to continue as long as school boards and federal judges can read judicial dicta and make semantic arguments contending that public authorities not required to use a more or the most expeditious means of accomplishing total rather than token desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.358" offset="4444766">And the most famous of such dicta is one that was composed 45 days, I believe it was, after this Court's remand of the Brown cases and the one called Briggs versus Elliot, the one that came from Claren County, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.483" offset="4497324">And the Court had convened with counsel to consult the type of decree to be entered and before counsel had an opportunity to make a suggestion what Judge Parker read from the bench, the what has become a very famous and much quoted dictum and is there that sprung the notion as he said that the Supreme Court had not decided that the states with mixed races, persons of different races in the school almost deprived them of the right of choosing the schools that they attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.659" offset="4614040">Or as the otherwise expressed it that the constitution does not require integration, it merely forbids discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.282" offset="4644551">Now, the -- in analyzing that dictum, the factual basis what was entirely false, because at that time they never had been there never was any right of persons to choose what school they would attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.375" offset="4688854">Not in the -- and certainly not in New Kent County no where in Virginia and I dare say not in Claren County, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.187" offset="4720097">But now in the language of the Fourth Circuit, majority in this very case, that right so bluntly assumed has been accorded an overwriting constitution dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.889" offset="4770879">The legal conclusion stated in Briggs that this Court had not decided that the state must mix races persons or different races in the public schools, and the constitution merely forbids the use of government power to enforce segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.732" offset="4818317">Those legal conclusions were in the very teeth of what the court had just held that the states failure to mix persons of different races in public schools denied the Negro children of equal protection of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.185" offset="4864084">The Briggs Doctrine has been very thoroughly analyzed from the historical and the cases referring to it had been collected by Judge Wisdom in United States versus Jefferson County 372 F2d at 386 beginning at page 861.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.957" offset="4935241">The Briggs Doctrine was very summarily rejected by Judges Sobbeloff and Winter in this very case, but unfortunately, it is still living law as far as the Fourth Circuit is concerned and that is why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.510" offset="4981426">So we urge in the words of Judge Wisdom written in the case of Singleton versus Jackson in 1965 that it is time that Judge Parker's dictum in Briggs versus Elliot were laid to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.526" offset="5029491">We ask that the case be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.302" offset="5036596">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.989" offset="5091349">A few years ago there was a very popular parlor game called gossip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.089" offset="5115695">And the game was played by a person writing down a little statement on a piece of paper not letting anyone see what he had written and then whispering it to the person on his left and letting it proceed to be whispered one person to another around the room, until it finally was whispered back to the person who had uttered it, and he would then state aloud what had been whispered to him and read aloud what he had originally said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.024" offset="5223424">And the point of the game was that the results were usually very amusing and sometimes quite startling that the change that had come to be in what was said originally and what got back to him because the message gets groveled in the transmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.474" offset="5293223">Over 13 years now since this Court decided the Brown cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.972" offset="5315271">The cases have been talked about, construed and interpreted in the courts of this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.076" offset="5343692">And I think that we can very quickly point out some of th results and similarities to the game of gossip by reference to portions of the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.881" offset="5526862">Your Honor, I would recall in the oral arguments -- in the course of the oral arguments in the Brown case, Mr. Justice Frankfort at one point in questioning counsel asked whether or not he did not think that in a decision of this magnitude, the court should not fashion its language with fastidious accuracy with his direct quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.279" offset="5616515">And I think that Your Honor, in light of these opinions, chose language very carefully because of the significance and importance of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.365" offset="5644831">And for that reason, I think that we have to the Brown decisions themselves to determine what this Court meant when it wrote about Brown decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.187" offset="5688090">If I may point out to the language on page 30 and 31 of the appellant's briefs, in speaking of Brown II, appellants say that this Court presuppose major reorganization of the educational systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.031" offset="5771473">And the that the direction of Brown II said that the lower courts were held to consider problems relating to admission arising our of physical condition of school plans, the school transportation system, personnel revisions, revision of school lines, attendance areas and so forth.</text>
