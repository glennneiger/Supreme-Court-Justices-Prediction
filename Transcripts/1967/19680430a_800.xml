            <text syncTime="20.059" offset="183568">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.132" offset="195897">Yesterday in response to questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.941" offset="207182">I touched only briefly on the background relevant to an understanding of the terms used in the 1962 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.612" offset="253785">That background makes it clears that all expense or package tours or what the board now designates as inclusive tours, were never operated in the past as charter trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.889" offset="318882">No carry, whether certificated or un-certificated, would have been able to do that because all what prohibited from conducting such tours, if you can call them that as charter trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.285" offset="380531">The certificated carriers conducted tours of that type not under any charter authority at all, but under their individually certificated authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.085" offset="427760">Now you must bear in mind that under the Civil Aeronautic Acts in 1938, the certificated carriers were given the broadest possible scope of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.004" offset="479378">Air transportation was defined as virtually everything subject to the regulations of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.802" offset="506546">It included individual ticketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.736" offset="514278">It included charter services.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.648" offset="522010">It included so called special services.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.949" offset="535176">Now why was there a Section 40 (e) to which I referred to yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.588" offset="561716">Section 40 (e) was concerned only with activities of certificated carriers off their routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.477" offset="597243">On their routes they could sell tours as part of their individually ticketed services, when I say tours I mean what we then call all expense package tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.363" offset="640815">Off their routes they could perform charter trips and it was in that connection as charter trips or special services that you found a grate many board regulations designed to make sure that charter trips were not used to infringe upon individually ticketed services off route of other carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.941" offset="759097">Now the boards own regulation as I say for almost three decades have recognized that basic distinction between the individually ticketed type of travel and the charter type of travel which did not involve directly or indirectly the solicitation of individual members of the public, or the individual ticketing of members of the public, or the use of travel agents to sell to the public for the purpose of providing the patronage for charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.015" offset="883440">Now everybody agrees here I believe that the primary purpose of the 1962 amendment was to confine the supplemental carriers, hereafter from that point forward to charter operations exclusively and to keep them away from individually ticketed services.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.468" offset="965256">As the conference committee report pointed out when it was talking about the Bill which became law, it said that under the House Bill the term, and I'm reading from page 199 (b) of the petitioner's of appendix, the legislative materials appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.834" offset="1046758">Under the House amendments the House Bill the term “supplemental air transportation” did not include individually ticketed and way Bill services.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.016" offset="1091480">Therefore supplemental air carriers could not have had engaged in such services on a permanent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.149" offset="1123976">The substitute agreed to in conference adopts the provisions of the House amendment with respect to the prohibition of individually ticketed and way Bill services on a permanent basis.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="267.854" offset="1174758">The Senate Bill would've done the opposite.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_r_neaher" startTime="270.123" stopTime="472.393">
            <label>Mr. Edward R. Neaher</label>
            <text syncTime="270.123" offset="1183848">The Senate Bill as its pointed out here would have included such services and those supplemental carriers under the Senate Bill could have engaged in individually ticketed services but the Senate Bill was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.199" offset="1236198">Now in a reply brief the petitioner, American Society of Travel Agents ASTA, while freely considering -- conceding that the supplemental could work prohibited from engaging in individually ticketed services, attempts to put a gloss on what individually ticketed services means.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.183" offset="1332120">It refers to them as so called point to point services.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.810" offset="1350614">That's essentially its principle contagion that individually ticketed services as prohibited to the supplemental carriers only meant that narrow area.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.923" offset="1395022">Well in the first place the statute on its face says nothing about point to point.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.367" offset="1416861">It does say that charter trips are to be supplemental to the schedule services of the certificated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.845" offset="1466702">Obviously that in it self implies that there is a limitation on the charter trips, not all charter trips but only those that are supplemental to the scheduled services.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.986" offset="1511320">It says nothing about limiting the scheduled services to such a thing as point to point individually ticketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.119" offset="1539845">I might say that argument was advanced by the board yesterday I believe, and also by the supplemental.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.638" offset="1561893">But the point of it is that the statute on its face makes no such distinction within the area of individually ticketed services.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.965" offset="1599195">Individually ticketed services are historically services that mean you go out to the general public at large and you solicit individual members of the general public and you issued tickets to them as members of the general public and you do not treat as members of groups of charter organizations or other entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.448" offset="1681115">The whole legislative history of this Bill in both Houses reflects this clear understanding of the division between charter services on one -- on the one hand and individually ticketed services on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.491" offset="1745377">And it was only as Mr. Justice Harlan mentioned when the Senate was considering what to do about this legislation that the idea of a crossing over occurred in a very limited context.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.286" offset="1796472">In the testimony in the hearings before Congress, the board itself told Congress that it wanted legislation and that it intended to preserve the existing concept of charter in terms of the homogeneity of the charter group that it was definitely opposed to the idea that travel agents would be permitted as principles to charter aircraft and turn around and fill the air craft buy selling directly to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.276" offset="1928443">In the first print of the Senate Bill there was no such exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.067" offset="1947669">It crept in, in later prints of the second Bill of the Senate Bill and it was limited to the idea of all expense tours by groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.662" offset="2082043">The Senate as I say did adopt this exception which is recognized as an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.654" offset="2137945">Let me turn to page 31 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.905" offset="2158947">Senator Cotton, who is one of the managers of the Bill on the Senate side, pointed out “I do wish to comment briefly on one aspect of the Conference Committee's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.604" offset="2201788">The conferees agreed to drop the language in the Senate Bill which defined charter services and committed the sale of tickets on charter flights to individual members of the general public who are on all expense paid tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.906" offset="2254973">I am wholly in accord with the action in eliminating the all expense tour provision and thus refusing to confirm this power on the board.”</text>
            <text syncTime="547.520" offset="2293426">Now for us to say that individually ticketed was something wholly divorced from the concept of charter services in this context is completely refuted by one of the Senate managers understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.402" offset="2344939">The two were considered in relationship to one another and the whole purpose in dropping what the Senate proposed to do was to preserve what all the courts below agreed was the primary purposed of this Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.145" offset="2403976">To preserve the distinction between individually ticketed travel on the one hand, and charter route travel on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.940" offset="2443160">And that is why we say that what the board is done here with its present attempt to bring inclusive tours under charter trips is to break down that wall of separation.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.858" offset="2614836">I would like to say that of course as I think I mentioned yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.910" offset="2635003">It is not a question a attempting to undermine the economic stability of the supplementals at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.096" offset="2659767">The supplemental have a broad area of charter operation which are right or which is right for the development and very fertile.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.687" offset="2710131">As was pointed out at the end to day our society has the group complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.670" offset="2738030">We organize ourselves into groups of all kinds social, civic and what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.987" offset="2759346">We the respondents here are not attempting to say that under the charter operations the supplemental are not free to exploit that field to the full.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.700" offset="2806157">What we are trying to say is and what the policy basic policy consideration is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.664" offset="2829981">For some 30 years Congress recognized that the board was ineffective in its efforts to keep un-certificated carriers away from certificated individual ticketing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.844" offset="2902706">The board through various regulations that adopted tried to keep the so called irregular carriers from constantly figuring out camouflages by which they could convert their charter type operations into an individually ticketed service.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.615" offset="2981804">The same way the certificate certificated carriers enjoyed a certificated service, because the basic pattern of the Act was to set up a certificated system with defined areas of service for each of the certificated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.940" offset="3051081">The irregulars came in to that as a new element particularly after the war when you have the large aircraft and the influx of trained flight personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.882" offset="3090892">And the board was attempting to cope with that and it had been very unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.880" offset="3110849">Largely because it attempted to give them what might be called quasi certificates, which the Court in the 1959 case said “You just can't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.844" offset="3150764">You either certificate a carrier and it carries with the all a consequences of certification, or you don't there is no halfway House.”</text>
            <text syncTime="771.774" offset="3190471">And therefore in 1962 when Congress was attempting to figure out with the board what the proper role of the supplementals was, it saw readily that the main source of their revenue were charter operations as they had been understood for some 30 years through charter operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.936" offset="3283153">This was where revenue came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.243" offset="3292348">They had never really derived very much from individual ticketing service, but they had been a headache in their efforts to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.301" offset="3340622">And it is our contention that the policy decision was made by Congress when it said we will create this separate class of certificated charter carriers limited to charter operations supplemental to what the individually -- to what the certificated airlines conduct with their broad grant of individually ticketed and other authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.991" offset="3455352">Supplemental to that, this is their backyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.525" offset="3473429">They are to keep out off the field that the certificated carriers enjoy under their broad grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.198" offset="3500178">Now you must bear in mind that under the certification granted to the supplemental carriers, they do not have to meet the public convenience and necessity and the fitness requirements that the certificated carriers do because they do not purport to maintain regular service or have that equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.608" offset="3581785">But the charter field under the concept in air transportation of charter is wide open to their exploitation and in fact I think they have been indicated in their briefs, they're not doing too badly at it because they even -- haven't even gotten started on this inclusive tour aspect --</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.466" offset="9141269">There was no question at the Bill adopted by the Congress committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.655" offset="9154017">Congress committee would clearly have supported the board's flexible authority to grant this kind of authority to the supplementals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.981" offset="9399254">Now perhaps the conference report should have been out sooner but at least they had seen the House committee report Mr. Justice, long before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.671" offset="9430079">They'd seen the House Bill and they knew that the conference committee was adopting the House Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.701" offset="9450141">And it seems to me that this gave them a warning where is there is no way to CAB or the supplementals or the travel agents or the congressmen who might have support them, would have the slightest idea that this kind of statement was going to be made on the floor five minutes before a vote which could be made in the House only after a call for a forum and was made in the Senate with no roll call or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.247" offset="9548361">And we believe frankly that this is a dangerous principle of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.253" offset="9568423">There maybe room for giving some weight to floor statements when the committee reports are ambiguous, where the Bill is ambiguous, where the statement are tested by real debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.333" offset="9604681">In this case there is no ambiguity in the Bill or in the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.258" offset="9620355">Clearly, there was no debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.467" offset="9629236">The hard realities of the legislative process should keep this Court from establishing any doctrine of statutory interpretation that permits floor statements under these circumstances even by committee chairman to alter or in graft additional provision onto an already clear Bill</text>
