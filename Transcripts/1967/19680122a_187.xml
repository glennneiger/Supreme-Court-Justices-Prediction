            <label>Mr. Charles A. Hobbs</label>
            <text syncTime="38.962" offset="259218">These Indians have always hunted and fished for subsistence and many of them still do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.561" offset="285654">In 1854, they made a treaty with the United States, giving up the last of their lands to the United States for the purpose of settling them up with the White settlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.018" offset="331421">In return, they received their reservation which, as we shall see, gave them the right to hunt and fish on that reservation according to their customs without interference from state or federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.589" offset="381680">Until 1961 no one questioned this right to hunt and fish and the Indians peacefully continued to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.353" offset="416789">But then Congress in the Menominee Termination Act made the Menominee reservation subject to state laws in general without saying anything about exempting the right to hunt and fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.280" offset="476453">The State figured that that meant that the right had been extinguished and the game warden came on the reservation and begun making arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.049" offset="511561">This case started in 1962 when three Menominee Indians were arrested by the state authorities for shining deer, that is hunting with the aid of an artificial light and for transporting a loaded and uncased gun in an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.383" offset="584913">In case you wonder, “Shining Dear” means, you go out on the woods with the flashlight or an automobile headlight and when a deer comes along and sees the light, he looks at it and freezes.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.919" offset="627022">His eyes glow in the dark and it makes it perfect target; it makes it very easy to shoot the dear and that's why it's against the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.362" offset="660773">It's unsportsmanlike.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.206" offset="668191">That's also the reason for the rule against carrying an unloaded and uncased gun or a loaded and uncased gun in an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.956" offset="707166">It is primarily against the law to shoot game from an automobile and this rule carrying a loaded and uncased game in an automobile is an aid of the basic rule against shooting game from an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.426" offset="757112">These are sportsmanlike rules that happened to be involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.214" offset="772263">A law, of course, the case does involve all of the rules of Wisconsin that apply to hunting and fishing of which there are three main purposes: conservation is one; sportsmanship is another; and possibly, though I don't think so, safety might be a third purpose for some of these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.740" offset="854288">While I'm on this point, let me point out some of the other rules that the State of Wisconsin has and would apply against these Indians subject to possible local waiver which I'm not aware of it if there is any.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.557" offset="905592">Hunting licenses are required and they cost from $2 to $10 depending on the type of hunting license that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.760" offset="938402">Certain species can never be shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.154" offset="948015">For example, quail, for example, elk and moose.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.690" offset="970167">If the Indians are subject to these rules, they can never shoot moose or quail.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.874" offset="990856">There are bag limits in seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.462" offset="1001200">For example, in the area covered by this reservation, the bag limit for deer is one deer per season and the season last for ten days from November 23rd to December 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.140" offset="1055953">The brief inadvertently said one deer per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.179" offset="1076120">If the just -- any of the justices noted that, it's an error for which I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.801" offset="1094614">The correct rule is one deer per season; that is one deer per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.884" offset="1114885">There are also the sporting rules about how game may be shot: you can't shoot a swimming deer or swimming bear; you can't hunt with the aid of an airplane; you can't shine deer, which has what brought us to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.295" offset="1172564">Back to our prosecution, in the Menominee -- Shawano, Menominee County court, the Indians admitted that they had done what was charged but they claimed the -- that the 1854 Treaty gave them an immunity from the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.620" offset="1233899">Judge Fisher agreed with them and he wrote a long opinion which is reprinted in the appendix, acquitting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.164" offset="1260022">The state appealed under state law to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and that court by a two-to-one decision reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.230" offset="1296280">They held that the Indians had the hunting right under the 1854 Treaty alright but that that right had been extinguished by the Menominee Termination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.606" offset="1349778">The Indians sought certiorari from this Court which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.817" offset="1370676">That appeared to settle the matter and so the tribe then filed suit in the Court of Claims, seeking damages for the loss of these valuable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.667" offset="1405994">The Court of Claims dismissed the claim on the ground that the Tribe still own the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.929" offset="1431071">Now the Tribe was very pleased at this rationale because they would much rather have the right to hunt and fish than they would any compensation likely to be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.328" offset="1476733">So although technically we lost the law, we did so for a reason of which we very much approved and hope that this Court will affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.717" offset="1518216">On the basis of the conflict between the Court of Claims and the Wisconsin Supreme Court, this Court granted certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.760" offset="13714369">Let me say -- first a word about the unusual posture of the case that has become obvious here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.483" offset="13757315">We do have some responsibility for that because back at the '63 term, the court invited our views with respect to this Wisconsin State Court litigation before the court acted on granting -- denying that petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.694" offset="13830144">We then urged the court to deny the petition or at least we gave views which would have led to that result if the court had accepted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.838" offset="13886673">They are not in all respects consistent with the views we urge on the court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.798" offset="13934529">At all times, we have taken the position that there is some state jurisdiction to control hunting and fishing on what was the Menominee reservation and which is now the Menominee County.</text>
