        <title>United States v. Third National Bank of Nashville</title>
        <section startTime="0" stopTime="2381.421">
          <heading>Argument of Daniel M. Friedman</heading>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="0.000" stopTime="560.713">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">That is the individual employees did not have a vested interest in the plan and apparently this was considered a serious problem to the bank and finally, this bank, unlike the larger banks, did not have any automated equipment or even semi-automated equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.722" offset="170297">It did not have a computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.074" offset="179702">Despite these problems, the Weaver and his group decided to go ahead and to buy controlling interest of the bank which they did for a price at about $3,780,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.080" offset="235708">They paid $350 a share for this stock and apparently, the price they paid reflected some of the problems of the bank because a financial study that was prepared for the bank at the time of this acquisition, start to pay it for Mr. Hill, indicated that this stock was being purchased at 15 ½ times earnings whereas, stocks of other banks in the South Eastern United States were being sold at 18 ½ times earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.843" offset="378755">And at the trial Weaver explained that the stocks of the banks that were priced at a substantially higher earnings multiple were not comparable and the reason he explained that, it's set forth at the bottom of page 502 of the record was he said, speaking to Mr. Weinbaum, our trial counsel, these banks that are being compared, Mr. Weinbaum, most of them are fully automated.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.210" offset="472168">They have funded pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.268" offset="480423">They have an adequate branching system.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.472" offset="489305">Their headquarters and their branches are modernized, you simply can't compare on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.356" offset="512815">Now, Mr. Weaver testified that his group originally bought the stock as an investment and that that no intention of selling the bank or merging it.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.828" offset="550640">But he said that after they had looked into the problems of the bank a little more, they decided they were even worst than they had anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.458" offset="581256">He said they smoked to a lot of people they knew in the banking field for advice, how to solve the problems of this bank, but they would tell that the problems were very, very difficult and that would be almost impossible they were told to find a replacement for Mr. Hackworth, the president of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.815" offset="650637">They also said they discovered it would cost more than they had anticipated to fund the pension plan, the locations for branches were very difficult to find and they were very expensive and so the result of these discoveries, they started serious discussion with a Mr. Fleming, the president of Third National Bank who made the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.748" offset="750320">At the bottom of page 515 of the record, Mr. Weaver explained the role Mr. Fleming played in persuading him to make the sale and this is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.271" offset="800475">He said Mr. Fleming is a great salesman and he sold beyond the idea and my associates that the problems, the great problems of this bank could best be solved through a merger with the Third National Bank and that the best interest of a stockholders, the employees, the officers, and the national community would be best served through a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.310" offset="888560">And the same thought was repeated page 535 when he was asked, “Would you say that Mr. Fleming more than any other single person illuminated the problems of the trust company for you” and Mr. Weaver replied, “Yes, I would say that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.173" offset="948015">He certainly very forcefully brought to our attention the problems” and then he added of course, you must remember that we have already discovered many of these problems when we started our study in depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.918" offset="999006">Two months, after that Mr. Weaver Group purchased the bank for $350 of share, it sold it to the Third National in exchange for stock of the Third National which then had a value of between $405 or to $420 a share or roughly a profit of between $600 and $760,000 on the investment of three and three quarter million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.413" offset="1113004">Now interestingly enough, this was not the first time since he had purchased the stock that Mr. Weaver had discussed the possibility of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.053" offset="1147591">About two weeks after he purchased the stock, he had the discussions with the president of the Commerce Union Bank which was the third largest bank in Nashville that was also interested in buying the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.537" offset="1197537">Now Weaver testified that he was at that point not particularly interested in selling because he had purchased the stock for investment that they had discussed the possible exchange of Commerce Union and Nashville Bank stock and the Commerce Union had offered them only 10 shares for one which was worth just about $360 a share and he wasn’t interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.591" offset="1285726">The president of Commerce Union on the other hand testified that negotiations terminated because they couldn’t' get together on price that they were talking about 10 to one, and Mr. Weaver is talking about 13 to one and roughly $100 more.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.208" offset="1344240">After the approval of the merger by the boards of directors of the two banks, it was submitted as the same required under the Bank Merger Act of 1960 to the controller of the currency for his approval, his approval was necessary before a merger could be consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.224" offset="1408293">And as the statute required the controller sought of use of the two other banking agencies and of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.941" offset="1439117">That is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.052" offset="1459597">All three of these agencies advised the control of that in their view the merger would have significant anticompetitive consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.433" offset="1493138">The controller nevertheless approved the merger and the government within a week filed a suit and sought a preliminary injunction to stay the merger, pending the completion of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.624" offset="1537860">After hearing the district court denied the injunction on the 18th of August 1964, the merger took place the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.514" offset="1577462">Before the case came to trial, however, the Congress passed the Bank Merger Act of 1966 which in terms applied to this case because it was a case that was pending at that time and under that statute as it permits the control of the currency intervened in the district court in opposition to the government's case and he is appearing before this Court today, supporting the position of the appellee banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.560" offset="1697625">After a lengthy trial, the district court held for the defendants and dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.676" offset="1726046">The court ruled that under the 1966 Bank Merger Act, the standards for determining the anticompetitive effect of a merger, are not those that traditionally have been applied in Section 7 of merger cases, but rather that the standards were those that this Court had applied in 1948 in the Columbia Steel decision, a Section 1 case involving a corporate acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.366" offset="1840880">And that case by the way significantly we think in this Court's Lexington Bank decision about three years ago, this Court stated the case was to be confined to its own special facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.764" offset="1886438">The district court also indicated that in deciding the competitive impact, it was appropriately considered not only competitive factors but also the so-called banking factors which are a matter to be taken into account in determining the convenience and needs defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.002" offset="1955401">And the Court concluded at pages 7 -- 97 and 98 in its opinion, that he said although the plaintiff has established an arguable case for condemnation of the merger under the pre 1966 standards of the Lexington Philadelphia and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.620" offset="2033873">Treating Davidson County is the relevant geographic market and commercial banking as the services or products market, the merger is not violated of the new antitrust standards of the 1966 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.173" offset="2088103">And then as I've indicated, the court went on and made findings of its own that at any event, the anticompetitive effects of this merger clearly will clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.060" offset="2143587">Now, we think that the district court was clearly wrong in its view that in the 1966 Bank Merger Act, Congress intended to change the substantive standards for determining the anticompetitive effect of a bank merger?</text>
            <text syncTime="526.061" offset="2207640">In its Houston Bank opinion last term, although in a somewhat different context, this Court stated that Congress intended that a defense or justification be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.621" offset="2253824">Once that it had been determined, that a transaction would have anticompetitive effects as judged by the standards and normally applied in antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.762" offset="2294471">The language which Congress used in this section with the one exception that I will come to in a minute that it does not contain the words in any line of commerce, is identical to the language of Section 7 of the Clayton Act that that is --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="560.713" stopTime="566.438">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="560.713" offset="2346193">That decision was before the district court's decision, before this Court's decision in Huston Bank?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="566.438" stopTime="1327.740">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="566.438" offset="2369076">Yes, it was Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.097" offset="2387780">The language is that the effect of which is effective in any section of the country maybe substantially to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.093" offset="2415783">And it seemed that when you're dealing with a statute involving mergers, like this one is specialized type of merger, and where Congress has inserted a special defense, it requires a very clear showing that with Congress use the identical language in the Clayton Act, it really intended a different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.802" offset="2490598">Not only is there no such evidence in the legislative history, but as we developed in the reply brief we have filed, the sponsors of this legislation indicated that they did intend the standards to be applied in determining competitive effect to be those traditionally applied under the Sherman and Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.683" offset="2570115">For example the Congressman Patman who was responsible of the bill that was finally enacted and whose statement is in this Court, “relied on heavily on the Houston Bank Case stated that the competitive standard to be applied is clearly that of the Sherman and the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.640" offset="2637928">Because we think it's very clear that what Congress did in this statute was to provide that you determine the anticompetitive effects of a bank merger the same as you'd always determined anticompetitive effects, but then provided a limited exception, there were certain situations where the anticompetitive effects if clearly outweighed by the convenience in need of the community to be served would suffice to validate an otherwise anticompetitive merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.089" offset="2747747">And that is it seems to me in this all setting a part of the balancing factor that consideration of special factors applicable to banking play their part, but only there.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.701" offset="2794141">They do not play their part in determining competitive injury in the sense that a different standard is to be used where a determining competitive injury for banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.253" offset="2840430">Now the controller makes another argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.592" offset="2853700">The controller argues that because in this statute the words in any line of commerce do not appear whereas they do appear in the Clayton Act, this indicates that Congress intended that in bank merger cases henceforth the relevant product line was to be something broader than commercial banking which the district court in this case found was irrelevant product market, it was intended to encompass all financial institutions that is savings and loan associations, insurance companies, credit unions, any groups that make financing available to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.983" offset="3007300">The district court rejected these arguments, saying that he couldn't be assumed that Congress would have made such a significant change by mere omission and he also said there was no really significant legislative history to support the contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.077" offset="3067695">We fully agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.972" offset="3075218">We again have discussed in our reply brief that there's nothing in the legislative history that establishes that by not using the words in this case, Congress intended to change the standard for determining the appropriate product market, a standard which this Court has twice upheld is properly permits the treatment of commercial banking as the relevant line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.477" offset="3181275">In addition, the point I previously made that there is no showing of any intend on the part of Congress to change the substantive standards also applies here because the determination of the relevant product market we think is an integral element of determining competitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.861" offset="3254836">Now we think that under the proper standard for determining anticompetitive effect that the effect of this merger clearly was substantially to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.106" offset="3291826">As I've indicated, the National Banking Market in Davidson County was highly concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.182" offset="3316067">Three of the banks had 93% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.968" offset="3331218">The merger increased concentration to 98% and none of the remaining banks had more than 1% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.529" offset="3361520">Now this Court's decision in the Philadelphia Bank case recognized that a merger would result within a combination controlling 30% of the market threatens undue concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.663" offset="3406033">And the Court's opinion also pointed out that if concentration is already great, the importance of preventing even slight increases in concentration and so preserving the possibility or eventual decontrol is correspondingly great and we think that is precisely this case, highly concentrated a further substantial indicate increase in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.690" offset="3490147">And moreover this merger eliminated the only middle-sized bank in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.333" offset="3512717">What you have after this merger is three very large banks and four very small banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.478" offset="3529331">The middle-sized bank, the one that seem to us is the most powerful source of some possible ability of deconcentration has been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.057" offset="3567574">Now the district court found in this case, and the appellee has vigorously argued, that National Bank was not a meaningful or substantial competitor in the national community.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.675" offset="3614072">The argument was that because it wasn't as modern, and as efficient, and as effective as some of the other banks, there was not a meaningful competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.209" offset="3652211">This argument, we think rests on a mistaken notion, of kind of competition, Section 7 is designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.827" offset="3686693">And if you have a bank like this that was have been growing, that has a substantial share of the market, we think it is definitely a significant competitor whose elimination poses the kind of competitive threat that Section 7 was designed to reach even though it may not have used the most modern merchandising methods, the most up to date business techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.319" offset="3776658">Admittedly this fact may not have been the most efficient competitor in the market, it didn't have any significant number of branches, it was not aggressive -- as aggressive as some of the others in competing from the business, but nevertheless we think it was and the record shows a significant competitor in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.440" offset="3845099">The presidents of the two other largest banks that is other than Third National, who presumably are in as good a position as anyone to know what kind of a competitive this bank is testified that National Bank was a vigorous and effective competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.675" offset="3906121">Now because of its much smaller size, and National Bank was only perhaps seven third, eight is large as these big banks, because of its smaller size, it naturally tended to the medium size and smaller accounts, and to the medium-sized and smaller businesses in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.299" offset="3980518">The president of the third largest bank, Commerce Union testified that they had encountered Nashville Bank in soliciting these smaller and medium-sized accounts, and that will indeed meet them, we found that the competition was very aggressive and we knew that they were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.621" offset="4053870">They said that they have Hackworth joined the bank in 1956 as they said; they became quite aggressive in direct consumer loan business.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.917" offset="4086993">The president of the largest bank, First America, also gave similar testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.957" offset="4115205">He said that in late 1963 and 1964, his chief rivals in Nashville were the two other large banks and Nashville Trust, that in recent years, competition between his bank and National Trust for demand deposits was very keen, and that National Bank was a major competitive therefore and he said that in 1963 and 1964 just before the merger, National Bank was that he described it a major competitor for the smaller industrial and commercial loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.965" offset="4243205">Another indication as to the role National Bank played in this market and as to the competitive injury that resulted from its elimination was that this bank provided its customers with certain advantages not furnished by the other banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.354" offset="4300779">For example, National Bank had lower service charges on its checking accounts than did -- the other large banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.889" offset="4334947">That's shown by an exhibit at page 1180 of the record in Volume 3, The district court said this was insignificant because it said the amount of deposits to which these lower service charges applied were only 4% of National Bank's demand deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.812" offset="4418644">Well that's true and the reason that it's true is because these lowered charges on checking accounts are only significant on small accounts when you have a huge account with thousands of checks, they don't charge you so much for check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.991" offset="4471306">They work something t it, is precisely in dealing with the smaller depositor who had $300 or $500 in deposit that the lower service charge on the checks was significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.166" offset="4519999">The record also shows that there were at least two small businessmen who were able to get loans from the Nashville Bank after they had been turned down by one of the large banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.005" offset="4579349">And one of these witnesses, a man named Dole, when it was asked the effect of a merger on small borrower such as himself, explained very cautiously why he thought a merger like this had a bad effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.534" offset="4641520">He said, I think the page 862, top of the page, I think the more outlets you have, the more opportunities to seek or search for a loan, the better opportunities you have got.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.805" offset="4694601">So to sum up on this aspect of the case, we think Nashville Bank was a significant factor in the market and that its elimination by a merger, which significantly increased concentration in the market, the effect of this maybe substantial to lessen competition as this phrase has been defined in the cases under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.394" offset="4780910">Now, we also think that the district court's error in determining competitive effect, necessarily in fact that its other determination that any anticompetitive effects were clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.508" offset="4845380">The statute permits an anticompetitive merger to be approved only if these community benefits clearly outweigh, not outweighed, clearly outweigh the anticompetitive effect and we don't see how that determination can possibly be made in a vacuum without first determining precisely how significant the anticompetitive effects are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.708" offset="4942242">Now the banks attempt to justify the lower court's decision on the theory that whether or not, the district court was correct in its assessment of anticompetitive consequences in any event it was clearly correct in concluding that the anticompetitive effects outweighed, I am sorry, that the convenience and needs of the community outweighed the anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.215" offset="5032208">But this it seems to us, this is not the kind of statute under which the all setting community benefits is an alternative ground for upholding the decision of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.937" offset="5075153">This is a different kind of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.629" offset="5081840">There is basically three elements under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.355" offset="5092812">First you determine anticompetitive effects; if there are no anticompetitive effects, that's the end of the inquiry, the merger is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.033" offset="5119457">Second if you determine there are anticompetitive effects, you then ascertain what the effect of the merger is and the public and meaning, the public interest of the community in convenience in necessity term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.884" offset="5166895">And then after you made that assessment, then you must balance the two to see whether the community benefits are clearly outweighed in the public interest, clearly outweighed in the public interest, the anticompetitive effects that have been found and it seems to us you can't possibly make a reasoned and careful judgment on the later question where it does clearly outweigh unless you have given fair weight to the anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.035" offset="5279535">Now we think however that over and beyond this, the district court's determination on convenience of the needs of the community as subject to a further flow, the failure of the district court to recognize that the problems of the Nashville Bank could be solved by some step short of an anticompetitive merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.953" offset="5383189">The banks argue that that is not a relevant inquiry under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.880" offset="5402937">They suggest that it's a very simple inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.109" offset="5483813">The district court addressed itself only in one footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.928" offset="5503039">It didn't discuss it in its opinion because in its opinion, the Court did not reach these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.629" offset="5521847">The Court did make one finding saying that because of the age of various of these individuals and some other problems, it was virtually impossible that the problems of the bank could be solved by anything other than a merger and we of course, do challenge that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.029" offset="5583496">Now the banks argue that there is no occasion to reach this issue because they say, all you have to do is all that statute says is, is you look to see the anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.657" offset="5626023">You look in the all say community benefits, and then you make a determination whether the community benefits outweigh the anticompetitive effect and if you found that it does, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.234" offset="5672312">But of course, what the statute says is that the statute says that these community benefits must clearly outweigh in the public interest the anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.998" offset="5715362">Reverting for a moment again to this Court's decision in the Houston Bank Case, this Court recognized that under this statute antitrust standards would have been the norm and anticompetitive bank mergers the exception and we don't think that in the light of this Congress ever intended to permit a bank merger that was anticompetitive to be approved if there was some other way of solving the bank's problems, that is another way of accomplishing the needs and convenience of the community that would not pose this anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.110" offset="5851826">So this it seems does brings us to the question of whether the bank's problems were exceptional, that only a merger could solve them and that requires consideration of two things; first the problems, and secondly, the steps that the Weaver group he took an attempt to solve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.519" offset="5921416">Everyone agrees that the primary problem of this bank was management that Mr. Hackworth was getting old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.464" offset="5945240">There was necessary to find a replacement for him as well as some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.907" offset="5963003">Mr. Weaver testified that their solution to this problem was they went around and talked to a number of people they knew in the banking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.805" offset="5998634">They had a lot of contacts and they said they spoke to a lot of people in the banking business, and they spoke to them at length, and these people told them, the problem was inside of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.560" offset="6033638">They did not attempt to hire a management recruiting firm to see if they could find at president because as he explained it, all they relied primarily, as he described it, all of the connections they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.187" offset="6088077">The government introduced as a rebuttal witness, a man named Mills who is from specialized in bank personnel recruitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.211" offset="6128201">He testified that he had at that time between a 150 and 200 existing bank presidents who were interested in making a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.728" offset="6170311">He also had a 150 to 180 top executive officers who were interested in making the change that he had placed over the past five years, an average of better than five bank presidents and 12 vice presidents that he had a large number of increase every year from banks seeking top executive officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.052" offset="6243558">And now these men that were available, he testified about 20% where either southerners or would be willing to work in the set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.424" offset="6277099">And at page 909 of the record, he made it this very significant statement in the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.858" offset="6306774">He said, “It's been my experience over these 30 years and 10 years from the employer's side that any bank which sincerely wants and needs executive management, and is wiling to pay adequate compensation for it, will have no trouble in finding it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.871" offset="6874885">The net operating income of the bank had increased in every year from 1959 to 1963.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.329" offset="6976658">They've found that in respect of many of these functions, Nashville Bank had a greater rate of growth than any other bank in the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.996" offset="10043329">The Trust Company was in 1956, changed its name to National Bank and Trust Company to reflect its banking activities that it was just embarking on at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.764" offset="10094425">Through the efforts of three men, with Mr. Hill Hackworth, and Kirby Primm who was in charge of their new business at that time, they did indeed make considerable strides and show considerable profits for the first four years of their operation from 1956 to 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.012" offset="10163388">At this time and in the four years preceding the merger, they began to go down hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.336" offset="10196720">Their share of the market in the national area, declined over 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.456" offset="10221171">And in 1964, they had only 4.8% of the market, which of course was in sharp contrast not only to the growth of the community but to the performance of the other banks in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.566" offset="10269654">So their relative position in the market, the client considerably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.575" offset="10289716">The IPC deposits mentioned by Mr. Friedman, which are generally regarded to be as the most effective statistical index of a bank's performance, the client absolutely and it was the only bank in the county to show an actual dollar decrease in these four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.500" offset="10365367">It was the only bank in the county who can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.893" offset="10378951">In 1962, some two years prior to the merger, Trust Company's loan portfolio had deteriorated seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.522" offset="10413432">It's ratio of classified loans to capital structure exceeded 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.872" offset="10434853">20% is normally the benchmark and only used by the regulatory authorities to indicate that corrective action is required.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.562" offset="10677582">It had – Trust Company had more classified loans by dollar volume than did Third National, although Third National's total loans was more than eight times Trust Company's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.427" offset="10733066">The classified loans at Trust Company were 145% of its reserve for bad debts in spite of the fact of Trust the Company's history over the years of having a rather bad debt history and in therefore it had a rather high reserve for bad debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.802" offset="10810598">Now the evidence in this case showed and the district court found that commercial lending is the heart of the commercial banking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.367" offset="10844871">It also shows the Trust Company did very little of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.551" offset="10857618">In spite of the fact that it had between $40 to $50 million in assets, it had roughly only $12 million actively engaged in commercial lending in the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.961" offset="10931179">The testimony indicated that if a man came in for a loan, and the particular officer that had handled that loan was out to lunch or on vacation, the man cannot be served because the information with respect to his loan was carried around in the officer's head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.756" offset="10998366">The Trust Company had the lowest loan to asset ratio in the county, the lowest asset ratio loan to asset ratio in the county, it was lower even than the smaller banks to which Mr. Friedman referred to that were only 1/4 or 1/5 Trust Company's size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.729" offset="11074330">I think the clearest stack in the record was Trust Company's serious problems with respect to its management.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.007" offset="11099408">The evidence indicated that four of the directors were over 75, nine were over 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.053" offset="11123545">Of its department head, two-thirds were 65 or older and I hasten to add these were not the mature men who had risen to the top of a profession but these were men who had in fact been passed over and were not contributing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.996" offset="11183313">In the department heads, there had not been a single change in the bank for over 18 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.629" offset="11213928">New departments were created when it became engaged in banking, but those department heads had never been changed and the other had not been changed for 18 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.630" offset="11253844">The average salary level of all employees in the bank was the lowest of the banks in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.092" offset="11279757">The average salary of all employees was lower even than the smaller banks in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.843" offset="11306715">I assume these are the salaries that the government's expert referred to as what he considered to be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.263" offset="11344436">80% of the officers in Trust Company's banking department were not college graduates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.500" offset="11369409">Our side of the Trust Department, there was only one man, one officer under 40, who was a college graduate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.083" offset="11403682">And in the entire banking department of the Trust Company, they had not hired a college graduate in the five years preceding the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.337" offset="11440671">They had only one branch in the county that had over 50 banking officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.357" offset="11460838">Again, the smaller banks in the county had passed it by in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.173" offset="11476093">There was one bank, the record showed, that was much smaller than Trust Company and had more branch offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.600" offset="11505768">Trust Company had no corresponding banking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.144" offset="11519979">And thus was unable to provide any correspondent banking services for the rural banks in the area, nor provide the contacts to its own customers that a correspondent banking system involves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.440" offset="11569089">Its bookkeeping and its accounting procedures were obsolete and inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.300" offset="11588524">Its mortgage ledgers representing over 40% of Trust Company's loans were kept with pen and ink.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.242" offset="11620289">It had no computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.529" offset="11629484">It used no computer service company and thus it was unable to handle any payroll account that involved IBM or other computer cards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.289" offset="11684551">It lacked any continuous system of auditing the various receipts and disbursements and not unexpectedly this led to a discovery after the merger of a major defalcation, over $50,000 that had taken place prior to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.158" offset="11756022">The controls over its Trust Department were breaking down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.345" offset="11772740">The FTIC examiner found that the improvements that they had previously recommended had not been carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.789" offset="11798549">Little control had been exercised over the trust officers and that certain of the members of the trust department had acquiesced in violations of law in the use of trust funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.190" offset="11852152">And the FTIC's rating of the bank for the two years preceding the merger, had been reduced below satisfactory to fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.741" offset="11890291">The Trust Department, of which it was so found, had never had a rating above fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.581" offset="11921742">Now these problems that I have just enumerated occurred prior to Mr. Weaver's purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.798" offset="11950582">What happened after Mr. Weaver's purchase?</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.189" offset="11964165">Well Mr. Hackworth on whom Mr. Weaver was counting to run the bank, indicated an expression – to a desire to retire because of ill health and that ill health subsequently caused his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.332" offset="12020694">Mr. Primm, who had been in-charge of the new business, was taken away by the largest bank in the county First American and took a considerable amount of business with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.835" offset="12066670">The control of the currency noted, in which – and his findings are part of the record in approving the merger, that within 60 days after the sale, that is between the time the bank -- the Trust Company was sold to Mr. Weaver's group and the time in which they turned around and sold it, the assets of Trust Company had gone down from $45.4 million to $39.6 million or a decrease in that short period of almost 13%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.332" offset="12192684">And finally, though Trust Company was showing a profit as it's been pointed out, I think it is fair to say that that even that profit picture was distorted and it was unhealthy and the testimony showed that these profits had been squeezed out of badly needed revenues for operating expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.575" offset="12273664">And there was a list of expenses that was not only needed but which the acquiring bank, Third National put into effect, actually extended to indicate that almost the entire pre-tax profits were necessary to put Trust Company on its feet as annually recurring expenses, in addition to whatever capital expenditure would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.877" offset="12370840">The largest capital expenditure for example, was the one that was actually put into effect and to create the funded pension plan that was almost half a million dollars, it was $400,000 plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.721" offset="12438235">Now I would like to get to what we consider is the government's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.152" offset="12463940">And that is, that in spite of the fact that the new law had its primary emphasis placed upon creating one uniform standards for use by courts and banking authority agencies alike in judging bank mergers and in spite of the fact that Congress was primarily emphasizing the needs for courts to examine the so-called banking factors, nevertheless insofar as its substantive provision are concerned, the Bank Merger Act of 1966 simply did no more than codify the already existing failing company doctrine that was in antitrust law with perhaps slightly expended contours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.423" offset="12645021">But again, their position indicates that in spite of the enormous study and effort that went into this new law, in spite of the fact that it's considered by some to be a major piece of legislation for the 89th Congress, it did no more than it was simply codify the failing company doctrine on the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.297" offset="12876570">The Attorney General took the position that convenience and needs should be considered only in the context of the effect on competition, and the likelihood of insolvency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.203" offset="13152214">Even if it does, I think, Mr. Friedman's colloquy with you indicates that if a bank does have alternative methods of solving its very serious problems, one cannot – it's not even necessary to inquire into the service to convenience and needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.167" offset="13236015">Now it seems to me that their position is based on not only on equating the floundering or stagnant bank with the failing bank, but in equating the banking industry with every other industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.194" offset="13300172">And considering that the problems associated with the elimination of the competitive unit in the banking field is similar to the elimination of a company in any other field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.885" offset="13358895">And I think this simply misunderstands the responsibility of a bank not only to serve the community, but to get its assets employed in a fashion that may not produce the greatest profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.257" offset="13432351">I think they misunderstand that even if the bank has been demonstrated to meet the convenience and needs test then somehow, the fact that Mr. Weaver showed the profit on it, or the fact that he listened to the truth as explained to him by Mr. Fleming, that somehow his profits outweigh the public interest in the elimination of this stagnant institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3878.324" offset="15616711">They had only one, if they had built three branches or four branches, they would have shown no profit or whatsoever, nor have they had any money leftover for capital expenditures, nor if they need to pay capital dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.577" offset="15689644">Now the government made -- the government after the time of the trial in its brief indicated that the Court was required to consider the effect on the competition of -- and on the public interest of an acquisition by competitive bank in Davidson County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.321" offset="15780655">They indicated that the law requires that alternate purchasers be considered and that this record showed that there was an alternate purchaser namely the Commerce Union Bank, that was a smaller bank, and that therefore, the district court erred because it did not consider this as an alternative less anticompetitive solution to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.144" offset="15891937">Now I think again, this indicates the deficiencies of the rationale of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.749" offset="15918373">They found that the State, that this merger itself would have been anticompetitive, would have combine 26% of the banking assets in the community, would have combined 35% of the banking offices in the community, and would have resulted in exactly the same degree of concentration in the market, in the top three banks that resulted from this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.403" offset="16020982">And yet they say, that's a less anticompetitive solution and vitiates the judgment of the trial court that this merger was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.631" offset="16065912">To windup my part, I would like to comment just briefly on the trial judge's opinion in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.901" offset="16094960">The government for much of its brief, indicates that the trial judge's reference to the Columbia Steel Case in effect fatally undermined his judgment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.324" offset="16156714">I think he had two problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.862" offset="16162774">First of all, he simply indicated that he felt that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 was analogous to the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.614" offset="16201853">That in weighing, convenience and needs against anticompetitive effects, this required a balancing of other than the usual Section 7 considerations although he realized that Section 7 considerations were also involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.546" offset="16277608">Secondly, he considered and weighed every factual matter that this Court has thought under its Section 7 considerations pertained to mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.022" offset="16327450">And he stated in his opinion, that under those, what he called pre-1966 standards, the government had established an arguable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.684" offset="16370082">We think this indicates that his reference was left to the statute as a whole and not simply that the methods by which anticompetitive effects would be considered under Section 7 had been changed and as indicated, Mr. Justice Harlan, the case was decided prior to this Court's decision of Houston.</text>

            <text syncTime="4103.937" offset="16519084">Just one or two points before I close.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.992" offset="16531310">I would like to make clear that in the opinion of the appellee banks, the floundering bank question in its elimination as a competitive unit, can have considerations that pertain both to the anticompetitive effects question and the convenience and needs question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.758" offset="16618454">But I do think it is important to note that while the problems with respect to the anticompetitive effects are rather apparent when we are dealing with this stagnant institution because in many respects it will not be competing effectively, the Court should not overlook the very important thrust of the legislative debated of the law itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.818" offset="16714689">It seemed to emphasize in addition to the competitive questions that surround the elimination or the operation of a stagnant institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.069" offset="16755649">The manner, the fact that such an institution also very often fails to provide certain banking services to the community even though it maybe rendering some competition which would be eliminated by the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.889" offset="16826911">So one has to look at both sides of that question, both sides of what the government refers to as the equation when we're talking about a stagnant institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.256" offset="16872364">Also, I want to emphasize that we do feel that this record indicates quite clearly that there are -- that the convenience and needs of the community was met by this merger in increasing and bringing better service to the community totally apart from the anticompetitive considerations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.524" offset="16973511">Now the reason I said that I thought that the government's equation or analysis of this law, in effect was limited pretty much to the failing company doctrine is because, as emphasized rather heavily in their original brief, they seem to say that community needs and services are some new and important kind of service not being rendered by any bank in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.603" offset="17097749">And I don't know what they are talking about on air pollution, or traffic safety, or what, but it seems to me you have to consider banking services when you are considering convenience and needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.264" offset="17148426">But if you read out of it almost as they do, the convenience and needs question, then you get over to the anticompetitive side, and then you limit yourself to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.232" offset="17192312">And then they say, “We're back to the failing company doctrine in the look for alternative purchases, etcetera.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.025" offset="17223450">So I think in this case, we had the elimination of a bank as a competitive unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.456" offset="17253230">That not only was failing to render the kind of services that it should and therefore was failing to compete as effectively as it should, but also from a convenience and needs point of view, was failing to render to the public apart from competitive considerations, the kind of service that the public in Nashville was entitled to receive from each banking unit and the customers of that banking unit some 10,000 strong were not receiving those services.</text>

            <text syncTime="4386.823" offset="17650709">And there they found that the failure of the ICC to find the Section 7 violation was not necessary as long as all the factual matters involved in the anticompetitive effects question were examined, and the impact on competition was examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.243" offset="17740361">I think that is the question that this Court should look at and not simply a reference to a case that stands for the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.241" offset="17768364">So my answer to your question would be to -- that this Court should examine whether the district court looked at all of those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.998" offset="17811414">If it did, its opinion should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.335" offset="17820714">If it found that it didn't, that it failed to look at all those factors, I assume that he should be required to reexamine those factors under the appropriate standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="4485.777" offset="18046516">There is first of all, a recognition in the Bank Merger Act by its very terms that two sound banks in substantial competition with each other can be merged out of exists -- merged into one, if the convenience and needs of a community clearly outweigh the anticompetitive effects of that merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.510" offset="18141393">I believe that the legislative history of the Act clearly demonstrates that Congress felt that a floundering bank or a stagnant bank such as we had in the National Bank and Trust Company was covered by the Act, without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.676" offset="18202102">Certainly the failing bank was not the intend of Congress because Section 6 of the Act provides that the agency may merge out the failing bank without the approval of the Attorney General, without an advisory report, and as far as prosecution for violation of the antitrust laws upon the consummation of such merger which can be immediate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4581.500" offset="18429367">Now the conclusion of that sentence in regard to 7 (a), the next paragraph, and it states that the action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of a merger transaction, shall be commenced prior to the earliest time under paragraph 6, at which a merger transaction approved under paragraph 5 might be consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.102" offset="18503764">So that there is no time between the approval and the time it might be consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.427" offset="18525080">So this -- the failing bank, the statement carried in Section 6 and Section 7, it's not applicable, Section 5 is not applicable in any sense of the word for the failing bank so two sound can banks can merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.639" offset="18573876">Now the banking agencies have considered convenience and needs in three different areas in the chartering of new banks and the approval of branches to existing banks, and then the mergers or consolidations of the existing banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.626" offset="18657886">The convenience and needs has never been defined by statute and to my knowledge never by a case settled by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.662" offset="18685994">So we have to look to those statutes that a bank regulatory agency considers preferably in this case in the charter with the new bank because they are similar to those used in the approval of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.035" offset="18735522">First, is the new bank needed by the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.207" offset="18752240">Will it be a sound bank?</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.036" offset="18763525">Do the proposers of this bank have a good management team?</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.414" offset="18781080">Will they be able to serve the community in the primary function of a bank particularly a commercial bank or it would be able to lend money in a way that it's going to benefit the economy of the community, without money by supporting marketing capital to industries, create jobs, expand plans, and in otherwise contribute to the betterment of the people whom that bank serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.200" offset="18876165">This is the one fact and now another factor in convenience and needs is competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.060" offset="18895600">Is there enough competition in a town or in area among banks, or among other financial institution if that maybe the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.744" offset="18930395">Would the addition of a new competitive entity injure the existing competition?</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.611" offset="18957772">And in a merger, where the removal of a competitive entity help competition which can be done and the record in this case is uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.275" offset="18996433">The competition among banks and financial institutions in Nashville has been greater since this merger than before the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.393" offset="19028929">Even the appellant's own witness, an economist, testified that this was a probable consequence of this particular merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.041" offset="19067486">I think we might best apply the convenience and needs test to this particular merger by asking ourselves some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.020" offset="19127463">First, the sole of the Trust Company was exposed during the course of this trial by the introduction of examiner reports, it's our confidential, unfortunately, the bank was out of existence at the time the trial took place or it probably would have destroyed the public confidence in the bank anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.481" offset="19209279">By the introduction of these examiner's reports, the internal weaknesses of the bank, the poor condition of its own portfolio, the deficiencies in its management, the default and its service to the community, and its acquiescence, indeed of violations of the law in the administration of Trust, things that were formally only known to the bank law officers and to the examining agency, which is not a contour of the currency of the FTIC were brought to the attention of the public and this is known in National Tennessee, because it received great covers in that city.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.078" offset="19363715">So I consider the bank in that condition where everyone knowing what it is, if the status quo were returned, as an employee now who worked for Third National Bank, would you want to go to the National Bank and Trust Company, at a salary which is lowest in the city and below the poverty level which is cut if government recognizes in its economic opportunity programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.719" offset="19470294">Every employee of National Bank and Trust receives an increase in salary subsequent to the merger with Third National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.289" offset="19512508">There are long-term division heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.884" offset="19518882">There's no promotional opportunity, no assurance of a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.018" offset="19539466">There is no funded pension plan and this is a regulatory problem for 40% of our nation's banks have no fund of pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.149" offset="19575933">As an officer, you have not given any responsibilities by this bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.889" offset="19598921">While Officer Kirby Primm, who was acknowledge by both, I should say the three sides in this particular case, who was acknowledge as being the outstanding business development officer had its salary increase only 45% in 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.248" offset="19652315">And upon leaving this bank to go to the largest bank in town, had an increase immediately 60%, showing how far out of scale, the officer's salary of this bank were.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.716" offset="19694216">As Mr. Henry stated, it had been 18 years since the department head have been changed and no college graduates were hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.956" offset="19727235">There was just no opportunity for advancement at all, and the officer salaries again where the law is entailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.816" offset="19750640">Moreover they did not have the tools to go out and get business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.134" offset="19767881">Their new business development officer testified that they did because of their lack of automation, their lack of a computer, things of that sort, lack of branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.135" offset="19803930">They were not able to go out and service the industries in the national area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.201" offset="19820126">And that includes a lot of comings around National, and there was no leadership in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.761" offset="19846457">As a depositor, knowing the condition of this bank, would you entrust the sum of money of your own over and above the amount ensured by the FTIC to the management of this type of individual who had this bank?</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.889" offset="19918973">As a businessman, needing the financial expertise of a bank, would you entrust your business and financial requirements to a bank that had no loan officer competent to handle the -- or supervise either the making or the employment of funds or the collection of funds?</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.441" offset="20005177">They're unable to service a $500,000 credit from an admittedly credit worthy mortgage broker in Nashville, and had to go out to the larger bank in town to get the assistance to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.086" offset="20051675">This bank was just not competing in the commercial field at all and there's no evidence to show that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.961" offset="20079261">As a community leader, the recreation of this bank would result in the removal, assuming that law policies to be the same as they were at the time of the merger, would result in the removal of $30 million of commercial funds available to the industries of that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.464" offset="20169226">And these days of tight money that is a substantial sum because in seasonal 90-day loan that comes out the $52 million a year available to meet the needs, recurring needs of other industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.553" offset="20221576">But as a regulatory agency, that this Court receiving as a regulatory agency ask yourself all these questions, would you charter a bank under your obligation to consider the convenience and needs of the community if upon the day that bank was created, $1 of an every $8 that it had let out, over above those real estate mortgages that it had, was classified as a loss or a potential loss item by the bank examiners?</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.466" offset="20357204">Would -- as I mentioned before, you charter a bank which was going to pay his employees such low salaries, now we'd have to consider the danger of the calcations because low bank salaries are admittedly one of the causes of embezzlement?</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.030" offset="20423450">Would you charter a bank when the proposers had nobody capable of commercial lending or supervising a loan?</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.096" offset="20451767">Would you charter a bank that had no credit files or whatsoever and had no plans for any?</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.607" offset="20485831">Would you charter a bank that had $8 million or was going to have $8 million in loans and keep all of the ledgers and entities?</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.494" offset="20525328">Would you charter a bank which would have on the day of its inception, a Trust Department which was permitting the deception of the public, by allowing principles of an association to speculate the perpetual care funds on which maintained other non-conforming trust?</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.530" offset="20597530">Or if you are chartering a bank, would you charter one that plan to maintain its records which were needed currently?</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.822" offset="20622712">In cigar boxes, packing boxes, and the like, the pictures of these are in the record of page 1205 and several pages thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.895" offset="20666911">That is what we would have if we chartered this bank today and if the convenience and needs of the community could certainly not be served by chartering such an institution --</text>

            <text syncTime="5160.818" offset="20746637">These reports Mr. Chief Justice were made in 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.857" offset="20774849">They showed a constantly or continuously deteriorating position of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.350" offset="20796792">They classified loans doubled between 1961 and 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.044" offset="20823542">And although, it improved very slightly in 1963, the examiner did note that many of the classified loans have been replaced with other classified loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.463" offset="20857187">And the Trust Department was criticized the violations that I referred to, was criticized for a period of at least those four years and for years before that according to the reports although I don't honestly know how long the situation did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.282" offset="20920508">I might point out that in serving the convenience and needs of the community, Third National Bank subsequent to the merger, has replaced all the speculative assets in the Trust Department with solid assets more prudent adherence to prudence manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.914" offset="20998980">Third National Bank has gotten rid of all of the classified loans, you know, by putting their expertise to work on them, getting collateralized and repaid or by charging off immediately upon the assumption of this bank of $121,000 as lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.771" offset="21074422">Third National Bank also has introduced a continuous trust audit because the National Bank and Trust Company despite its reputation as a good trust company, had absolutely no audit of trust assets and whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.990" offset="21143280">It did not have a continuous audit of its commercial department despite the fact that every National Bank in that region, with the same amount of deposits is subject to continuous audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.904" offset="21186957">That's uncontradicted testimony again to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.587" offset="21205765">So we submit that if you wouldn't charter a bank like that to meet the convenience and needs of the community, it is not reasonable that the rule of reason is to prevail in bank merger cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.977" offset="21259264">It's not reasonable to state that it was a violation of the law to remove all of these problems and to have a good sound, aggressive, and progressive bank take over the human resources and the material resources, and to employ them in the central side.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.405" offset="21337004">The Third National Bank -- the National Bank and Trust Company was the only mortgage lending bank in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.099" offset="21367724">They had about 40% of its portfolio in long-term mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.871" offset="21386846">Upon taking it over, the Third National Bank, put that mortgage paper, sold that mortgage paper, and that money is available for commercial lending.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.275" offset="21420492">And if the record is replete on one thing, it's the need and the central-south for commercial lending.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.587" offset="21441703">It is a capital deficit of area, experienced in one of the most rapid industrial growths in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.971" offset="21467303">It sorely needs investment capital and working capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.874" offset="21482872">And the Third National Bank has utilized the National Bank and Trust Company resources, and this has to be one of the primary factors in assessing convenience and needs certainly by regulatory agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.882" offset="21534908">The convenience and needs could narrow us down to whether a bank is going to do a good job or to deposit his money with which it has been entrusted.</text>

            <text syncTime="5390.968" offset="21667192">We believe that the legislative record in this case at least insofar as it was made by the supporters of this legislation, rather than its opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.499" offset="21709406">And the opponents of this legislation are clearly led by the chairman of the committee, Mr. Patman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.977" offset="21743261">The supporters of this legislation and the Court incidentally the three-judge court in the US v. Crocker-Anglo Case, another Bank Merger case, after an extensive study of the legislative history, arrived at this conclusion in its opinion which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.204" offset="21808149">The supporters of this legislation indicated that there was another antitrust standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.164" offset="21836048">Now the question is, how does the Court arrive at this?</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.328" offset="21848691">There's one difference between the language of the Clayton Act and the language of the Bank Merger Act and that's the absence of the phrase “line of commerce”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.120" offset="21887875">Now obviously there has to be some kind of a product market, but the legislative history has explained in our brief at more length, between pages 40 and 52, show that the Ashley-Ottinger Proposal intended that competition the banks received from all institutions be considered in assessing the competitive effect of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.224" offset="21988289">This Court, incidentally the House report on the Bill which finally became law, also used the phrase “competition among financial institutions” and Senator Robertson in floor debate, and in extension of remarks, indicated that the meaning of this was that competition from all financial institutions was to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.987" offset="22087346">Now we can get the statistics and they are contained in this record to show that it cuts the percentages down to about half if we introduced all the dollars deposited or lent by other commercial institutions or financial institutions of Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.063" offset="22147636">But it's almost impossible to get a -- in an accurate statistical measure if we consider the competition from all various financial institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.147" offset="22195911">If no defense was entered, and I think the Houston Case would hold this, it should be my interpretation of it, if no defense were entered, and obviously the standard of Section 7 and the standard set down by this Court in Philadelphia, that the line of commerce was commercial banking would be a valid one, but once the affirmative defense of the Bank Merger Act, the entire defense of the Bank Merger Act comes into play, and other financial institutions might be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.608" offset="22325791">I believe it's a Congress trying to say, “Let's consider not merely a pure statistical concept of competition, but let's consider the realities of competition in any given market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.468" offset="22385246">This bank, under that, you can blend really as Mr. Henry suggested, rather than try to get part of a scale over here and part of a scale over here, and put so much weight here and balance it off, I think you can blend the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.717" offset="22434252">The realities of competition in the marketplace where it occurs and the convenience and needs of the public which to a certain degree have to be under related.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.275" offset="22468524">A bank cannot be a competitor if it has no competitive ability no matter what the statistics might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.614" offset="22493811">So we would suggest that the Court can balance both sides of the equation without the necessity of making a formal balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.695" offset="22546160">So it can just consider the overall picture and ask itself a question is competition really hurt here?</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.829" offset="22570715">I submit that except for statistics Your Honor, there has been nothing in the record of this case to show that competition was adversely affected in any sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.117" offset="22611884">The two major bank presidents who testified as to the elimination of competition or the aggressiveness of competition, both had sizable corresponding balances from the Trust Company sitting in their banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.880" offset="22666846">The largest bank in town had $2.5 million of Trust Company funds at its disposable at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.486" offset="22697357">And it was made clear by other witnesses that what they are talking about meeting them in competition, is that they would go around and talk to these accounts in case their relationship between the largest bank in town and the Trust Company ever broke up, the largest bank would still be friendly with the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.900" offset="22771022">But the record is quite clear that in Nashville, a correspondent, large correspondent does not compete with the smaller bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.575" offset="22801638">They're helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.483" offset="22809266">Both bank presidents testified that they're helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5678.509" offset="22817416">They send accounts to the National Bank and Trust Company just to give it a hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.433" offset="22841135">So this was not a commercial area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.693" offset="22850121">National area as I said, is highly industrialized and growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.346" offset="22864750">The Acme Boot Company, the world's largest maker of boots started in that community or the communities around it, it has grown over the years and its needs have met by Third National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.357" offset="22912815">The president of that company although probably aware of the existence of National Bank and Trust Company did not know that it was a commercial bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.711" offset="22946252">It was just not considered a commercial bank in that community in any sense of the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="5722.801" offset="22994526">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.222" offset="23004244">I would first like to respond to the question of Mr. Justice Harlan put to Mr. Henry, and also asked for my comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.565" offset="23037680">As I understand the question is this, if this Court should disagree with us, that there's a balancing equation involved and that the basic determination is to be made in one step in effect, if the Court were to so view it, should this Court itself undertake to decide that issue or should it rather remand it to the district court to make that determination as an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.900" offset="23130990">As I understand that, it is your question, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.747" offset="23142379">And our answer would be that the case is here and we would agree that the Court of course, could remand it to the district court but we think it would be appropriate for this Court, now that the case is here to dispose of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5771.613" offset="23189817">Of course, as I think I have attempted to make clear that we don't think this is just one ball of twine here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5789.057" offset="23259617">But we would urge this Court to decide the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.832" offset="23278738">We hope that you would agree with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.279" offset="23288456">Now I'd like to refer briefly to the point that has been made about these classified loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.337" offset="23316668">Mr. Henry suggested that a loan that is classified, it is one that is generally uncollectable and somehow the fact that the bank has a substantial significant amount of classified loans is a very great danger zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.981" offset="23379257">The three different categories of classified loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.466" offset="23393259">There's one called substandard, there's another one called doubtful and as the third one, that is called loss and all of substandard means, is that it has more than the normal risk involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.711" offset="23446235">A substandard loan is not necessary alone that portends any serious doubt as to its ultimate collectibility and the substandard loans in the portfolio of the First -- of the Nashville Bank were primarily -- I'm sorry, the classified loans were primarily substandard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.158" offset="23523976">It's nothing novel for a bank to have classified loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.982" offset="23547277">Indeed a man, a witness named Robson who was the regional administrator of the National Bank, testified at page 840 of the record that Third National itself had quite a volume of classified loans as did other banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.400" offset="23641004">Now, I'd next like to turn to question that's been repeatedly urged upon here that the government somehow is trying to equate the convenience and needs test of a failing company doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.896" offset="23710908">That's just not so we do not contend that this is limited to failing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5906.865" offset="23730866">As Mr. O'Malley has pointed out under the statute if a bank is in serious difficulties, the bank is in serious difficulties under the statute itself, the controller may authorize a merger and commit a merger to be consummated without a waiting for the reports of the attorney general of the other banking agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5926.195" offset="23808188">The standard we have suggested for the kind of situation which Congress did intend, this defense to be applicable is set down at the bottom of page 8 at the top of page 9 of our reply brief, we said, Congress intended principle concern of Congress was to permit mergers involving so-called floundering banks, that is those which although not yet in failing condition, had sufficiently serious problems to cause great concern as to their future unless the deficiencies were corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.902" offset="23946951">Now what has to be done in dealing with the problems of a bank that is in difficulties?</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.702" offset="23970147">How extensive the inquiry has to be?</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.623" offset="23981850">What the people have to do depends necessarily on how serious the problems are.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.098" offset="24003793">There maybe situations where a relatively brief inquiry will make it clear to the people that there is no solution to the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5984.287" offset="24040469">We don't think that's this case however.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.550" offset="24049560">In this case basically, what is shown by this record is a bank that admittedly had problems, problems however that flowed primarily from the management, the old management in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.764" offset="24110477">Mr. O'Malley says, this bank wasn't really competing, what Mr. O'Malley means when he suggest that this bank isn't competing is, he means this bank was not competing as vigorously as effectively as the banking authorities would like to see a bank compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.410" offset="24189053">The standard of convenience and needs to the community, we suggest is not what Mr. O'Malley suggested whether the bank is making the best possible use of the depositor's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.171" offset="24232103">That's not the standard.</text>
