            <label>Mr. Frank J. Barry</label>
            <text syncTime="21.487" offset="189315">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.702" offset="202167">This case involves the validity of the decision of the Secretary of Interior which invalidated and declared null and void 18 Mining Claims in the San Bernardino National Forest about 40 miles from San Bernardino on the crust to the Mountains near Big Bear Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.863" offset="302791">The claims were located for building stone and they were located in 1959, in 1949, 1951 and 1952 by Mr. and Mrs. Coleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.033" offset="383457">The claims are 40 acres each and they extend from the main road, which is the main road to Big Bear highway no. 18 and they rise up on a mountain with a southern and eastern exposure - that is their exposure on those sides of the mountain - overlooking Baldwin Lake, in the distance the Mojave Desert and overlooking Big Bear Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.741" offset="506337">Claims were located for building stone and the principal issue in the case has to do with whether the Secretary of the Interior applied the proper rule when he declared that the time-honored, prudent-manner rule included a rule that there must be a showing that the mining claims or that the product of the mining claims, the building stone could have been marketed prior to July 23, 1955, the date of the Multiple Use Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.662" offset="662026">The importance of that date is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.226" offset="680312">The Multiple Use Act declared that common varieties of sand, stone, gravel and certain other minerals could no longer be deemed to be valuable mineral deposits under the mining law so that the discovery of such commodities on the public land would give one the right to locate and to have a valid mining claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.062" offset="787623">The evidence in the case was that the stone was quartzite.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.219" offset="812283">Quartzite is a very hard mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.117" offset="827852">It is a metamorphic mineral, a mineral that has been created by forces of nature acting upon sandstone.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.478" offset="869334">Quartzite occurs on the claims in large, massive chunks.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.299" offset="892531">And by that, I mean cliffs in the mountain itself that it breaks unpredictably; that is to say it doesn't break in slabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.135" offset="927953">It breaks in any direction without any prediction as to what it would be, but it is quite colorful.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.851" offset="962748">There are some pictures that indicate that it's a very colorful stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.357" offset="976750">It is not – it's got very dominant colors in it - reds and yellows and browns; they are very strong colors.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.612" offset="1009768">That the stone has been used and it locally and to some extent, away from the area for building; that, however, it is an unpopular stone in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.337" offset="1084688">One of the witnesses was the principal executive officer or western representative or southern representative of a stone marketing company who testified that the stone was unpopular; that the stone masons didn't like to use it; that it was too hard; that it was too heavy; that it dulled the tools that the stone masons used; that there haven't been any call for it for sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.829" offset="1190640">There was some reference to a call about six months ago that caused into make an inquiry among the other suppliers to know if any was available; that he hadn't stocked it for years and that there wasn't any to his knowledge being stocked elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.373" offset="1260857">The problem of marketability is related to the rule, the prudent-man rule, which is the rule that's been applied by the Department and upheld by this Court, is related to the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.827" offset="1314670">Indeed, it is merely an application of the rule to certain types of minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.796" offset="1342568">The marketability or excuse me, the prudent-man rule is this: that one does not have a valuable discovery which is essential to the validity of a mining claim, unless he has within the limits of his claim an exposure of mineral and evidence that a man of ordinary -- that would induce a man of ordinary prudence to extend his energy and his labor and his means with a reasonable prospect of developing a valuable mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.098" offset="1479764">This is the one, the principal, the most important element in mining laws so far as it relates to the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.465" offset="1517275">By failure to comply with this particular provision of mining law or by circumstances that do not qualify, the mining claimant is denied a patent which gives him unrestricted use of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.968" offset="1571192">He obtains the title in fee simple without any reservation, without any limitation as to what he would use it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.597" offset="1597733">He becomes the owner of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.400" offset="1604942">Indeed, even before he gets a patent, he has practically the rights of a patentee with the exception that he can't market timber or use other products of the land other than the minerals, the -- except in connection with his mining operation, The prudent-man rule has been applied over the years and from the earliest time, it has been applied with special reference to this type of mineral, which occur so widely that to say merely that you have the mineral would not really be sufficient to say that you can actually make a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.959" offset="1775156">Can a man, when he stumbles upon a deposit of sand, justify to himself the expenditure of the labor and the means necessary to develop a valuable mine?</text>
            <text syncTime="433.205" offset="1836178">Can he reasonably do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="434.575" offset="1841716">This is the test that we have applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.181" offset="1848090">And if what he is working with is something as common as stone or sand and gravel, the Department has required for years that there be a showing that there be evidence in the record to show that the defendant or that the contestant in the case could establish that he was able to extract the minerals to transport them to market and to dispose of them in the marketplace at a reasonable profit to justify his effort and his expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.632" offset="1985912">This basically is the prudent-man rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.222" offset="1996257">This is the rule which, as extended to, minerals of this character is known as the rule of marketability.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank J. Barry</label>
            <text syncTime="501.610" offset="2109837">The Ninth Circuit has indicated in its opinion that what was required by us was an actual showing that there had been minerals marketed at a profit at the time that the application is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.859" offset="2170859">All the we required is, that there be some showing that you could market it.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.169" offset="2188100">Now, that would included indeed some showing, for example, that if I were to invest my money today, that perhaps next Saturday, I would be able to market or at some reasonable time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.023" offset="2235434">But a hypothetical idea, to put the kind of money it would take into the development of a mining claim to develop a large mine for sand and gravel or for building stone, if I'm going to compete with everyone across the road and on the same side of the road as I am, I wouldn't invest that money unless I had some assurance that I could market the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.560" offset="2421635">Perhaps, I should detail a bit of the evidence as to what the experience of this particular locator has been on the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.908" offset="2459042">Over the period of ten years from the time that the claims were originally located until the hearing, he had sold approximately 1,000 tons of the stone by his estimate which are experts estimated was approximately correct and we don't question and that he got an average of $12 per ton for that thousand tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.642" offset="2561964">So that his total revenue from the property with respect to the building stone alone would be in the neighborhood of $12,000 over a period of 10 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.676" offset="2610030">That appears to have been his gross.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.360" offset="2616822">Now, he expended a very large amount of money, if this can be attributed to mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.763" offset="2638451">He spent a great deal of time, which was estimated, I think perhaps the Court could be justified in ignoring the enormous size.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.420" offset="2685053">This is the sort of thing that would naturally lend itself to exaggeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.912" offset="2703026">He valued his time at $3.50 an hour and he said that he worked 300 days a year and that so many hours a day and someone multiplied it out and it came to $157,000 but this is what he had been spending his life on for the past 10 years on these claims and this is the amount of gross sales that he had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.922" offset="2783065">In addition, he had expended a considerable amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.412" offset="2805008">He had invested money in equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.461" offset="2821204">Most of it incidentally, from what appears on the record, equipment that would be suitable for road grading.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.899" offset="2858924">The particular work that was done on the claim seems not to have been strictly speaking, coring work.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.391" offset="2880972">That is to say he did not excavate far down into the deposit but what he was doing was selecting from the rock slides in a broken pieces of rock that are found rather commonly across the surface of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.033" offset="2931545">He was picking out suitable types of rocks, sorting them out, classifying them and so forth and he would sell some of these rocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.368" offset="2960802">And as I say, over the period of 10 years, he sold $12,000 worth of rock.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank J. Barry</label>
            <text syncTime="721.944" offset="2991104">He lived on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.922" offset="2995075">He had a home there and he lived there with his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.723" offset="3006255">There's a picture of the home in the record, a colored picture and it shows it to be a quite and nice little piece of property right on the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.926" offset="3047111">There are number of roads on the claims that -- I don't know how many miles, I don't know that the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.262" offset="3068426">I know that it's at least 3 ½ miles of roads that go up on the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.349" offset="3084727">The claim covers an area of over a square mile or 720 acres and it's approximately -- well, a 640 acres to a claim or to a square mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.615" offset="3133837">Now, the Department of Interior in its decision, considered how much he had marketed of this stone over a period of time, all of which was in the record, how much he had gotten for it, how much labor he had to expend, how much of the stone there was in the neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.789" offset="3214503">And in the area in which these claims are located, there are roughly 40,000 or 40 square miles to 28,000 acres of quartzite exposed about a thousand feet thick.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.384" offset="3276884">And that's enough quartzite to stretch from here to there or some all sorts of statistics, it could cover the District of Columbia or third of the District of Columbia to a depth of about a thousand feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.106" offset="3331845">It could -- you can think of it in terms of an enormous amount of stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.411" offset="3360998">Now, most of the operation that had been conducted as shown by the evidence was, the business of simply sorting the stone that was found on the surface - that is to say he picked out pieces of stone that would be suitable for a particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.828" offset="3418676">In other words, if wanted to get some slabs, he would look around until he found pieces that broke into slabs and that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.687" offset="3446157">And these stones are piled up, in fact I think there are some pictures in the record that show that they were piled up in the vicinity of his home; some of them are flat and so forth and some of them are just chunks.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.494" offset="3489311">But most of the stone, the evidence showed, is the type that is massive and that if you try to break it, it breaks in an unpredictable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.762" offset="3526405">And that if a piece doesn't break out, suitable for the purpose that you need, it can be discarded or put through a crasher to make gravel out of it or something like that, but it wouldn't have any particular use to fill a particular order.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.525" offset="3581471">Now, we looked at this case, that is the Department of Interior who looked to the case, made a determination that if this man wanted to develop a mine there and wanted to invest the kind of money he was talking about to start at the top and work down that whole mountain of building stone that he could not have had a market, hot for that quantity but not for any kind of a reasonable operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.123" offset="3707904">He could not have had a market for his product of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.221" offset="3724204">And, we therefore concluded that he should not get a patent to the public domain to take this land out of the national forest, put it into private ownership for any kind of use because it was very likely, notwithstanding that there's no limitation on what a man does with property after he gets it, that a prudent miner would not develop this property for a mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.018" offset="3831411">And that is what we're trying to administer when we administered the mining laws in the Department of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.024" offset="3851473">The original law was passed in 1872 at the time when the country, when the laws of the country were intended to encourage people to go out and live upon the land, to fill up the country with people so there'd be some people living out there in these areas in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.566" offset="3933602">So there was lavishness about how the public land laws were administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.847" offset="3966725">Now, the law has not changed but times have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.865" offset="3982817">And I don't suggest that we have interpreted the laws any differently than they have been interpreted from the beginning but lots of things have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.059" offset="4019597">Nowadays, there are all kinds of demands for public land and you will notice in the Briefs that had been filed in this case that we are accused of having engrafted something on the new law, something that isn't authorized by Congress in some sense that we may have violated the rights of the contestee in this case, but I say that the law has not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.149" offset="4103920">The old cases support the proposition that one is not entitled to obtain land from the United States from the public domain, unless he can show that he will carry out a policy that Congress was trying to encourage, for example, to encourage the development of mineral resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.856" offset="4182810">From the very earliest days, we had the rule that that math that we were not giving a mining patent to someone unless on an objective basis, an ordinary prudent man would be one who would spend his time and money to develop the property, to develop a mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.330" offset="4260655">That was the rule that we adopted from those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.493" offset="4269328">Now I say that times have changed, because now there are lots of demands for lands and there's a great deal of concern for land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.637" offset="4297958">People need land for cities and for highways and for residences and for all kinds of purposes, for summer homes indeed in any part of the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.631" offset="4349889">And because times have changed, there's been a good deal more strictness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.594" offset="4365772">Before 1910, there almost was never a mineral examination by a government representative when if someone made an application for mining claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.501" offset="4409344">That's just an evidence of the attitude that we had about anyone who was applying for a mining claim in those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.687" offset="4438079">In 1910, we started hiring in the Department of Interior, we started hiring people to – local miners to kind of verify if the allegations that were made in patent applications and tell us was there really a discovery, are these people really entitled to get a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.067" offset="4511640">About 1917, the Department started hiring full time mining engineers and geologists to go out and make inspections of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.433" offset="4545076">And believe it or not, until 1940, they were still issuing patents without any mineral inspection of the claims by the government at all, but I think the times have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.794" offset="4590529">That mineral examiners have become more particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.389" offset="4604949">They have insisted that they see on the ground the evidence and the facts that justify this man's claim that he can make a business here and make a profit at his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.242" offset="4644342">And, lawyers and the government are being more strict in the application of rules that have been in the books and that have been spelled out by this Court just this strictly but no more strictly than they're being applied now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.404" offset="4693034">In the Cameron case, which is a very like this case, a case in which the Department had declared invalid mining claims on the rim of the Grand Canyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.975" offset="4735248">Mr. Cameron refused to leave the property as did Mr. Coleman, after his claims had been made -- declared null and void and the government sued in the nature of ejectment and in that case, the Court applied a strict standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.671" offset="4794075">It said, you have to have a discovery and the evidence has to be such that a reasonable man would spend his time and money with a prospect of developing a valuable mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.664" offset="4833991">The evidence in this case didn't show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.727" offset="4846320">The Circuit Court has said that the Secretary of the Interior, the Department of Interior, had rendered a decision which was arbitrary and capricious and abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.479" offset="4889266">And for what I've been able to see of the case is that means that the Decision that has been rendered in the Department was irrational, but it seems to me that it's a reasonable argument that we would ask this Court to review it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.425" offset="5137115">But just as we are asking this Court to reverse the Ninth Circuit, the Forest Service, who conducted this appeal and carried on the prosecution in the lower court, appealed and asked the Secretary to reverse the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.277" offset="5212453">There is a saying in the Department, I don't know if its common in government at all but you've asked me if it's still debated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.600" offset="5241814">I might say in response that we may be wrong, but we're never in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.797" offset="5262608">But we are -- and we do not believe that there is any question about it; that these claims cannot be marketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.117" offset="5307852">That is the product of these claims cannot be mark -- A mine cannot be developed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.491" offset="5325302">It would cause too much money to mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.806" offset="5334601">There's no evidence in the record to indicate incidentally that one could mine and make a profit, but we're saying that we go a step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.553" offset="5365635">The evidence that we have is that you could not mine because no one wants to buy this stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.040" offset="5387577">No substantial number of people want to buy this stone, certainly not enough to justify the United States in disposing of such a large tract to find land.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.802" offset="5514533">And if I can refer to the decision of the Ninth Circuit, the Court said that, “The Department had applied a rule in derogation of Castle against Womble and had required that, Castle against Womble is the old case of 1894 that was decided in the Department of Interior, that we had applied a rule that was in derogation of Castle against Womble and had required a showing that right today, that presently, the man was making a profit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.650" offset="5721945">It says, “To satisfy the requirement for a discovery on a building stone claim located before July 23, 1955, it must be shown that the exposed materials a common variety of stone appearing within the limits of the claim, could have been extracted, removed and marketed at a profit prior to that date.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.581" offset="5989648">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.934" offset="6011068">The issues in this case involve 18 cluster mining claims which were located during the years 1949 through 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.256" offset="6052446">They were located pursuant to the Building Stone Law, which is 30 U.S.C. 161.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.566" offset="6081599">And that law enacted in 1892 provides that “Lands that are chiefly valuable for building stone, may be located under the law (relating to cluster mining claims).”</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.709" offset="6162160">In 1958, the contest was filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.430" offset="6181073">The contest complaint has three charges, three grounds for seeking to hold these claims invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.768" offset="6214405">The first ground was that there was -- the lands embraced within the claims are non-mineral in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.155" offset="6264038">Now, in the evidence in this case and both the hearing examiners, and I believe even in the Brief of the government, it's stated, it's agreed that this land is chiefly valuable for building stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.118" offset="6331852">The evidence in your case shows that that's the only use that the land could be put.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.605" offset="6353795">There's no other -- there was no testimony that it could be used for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.607" offset="6377827">So on that charge was met and there's no controverting evidence whatsoever on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.199" offset="6404159">The second charge in the contest was that minerals have not been found within the limits of the claims in sufficient quantities to constitute a valid discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.786" offset="6458493">As Mr. Barry has pointed out, the evidence is clear that on the -- in these claims, these cluster mining claims and in the surrounding area, there is building stone to a depth of a thousand feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.944" offset="6531114">So that charge is simply met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.274" offset="6556505">There's just no evidence that minerals have not been found in sufficient quantities to constitute a valid discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.069" offset="6587643">The third charge related to the amount of work required on each claim is $500 worth of work and they said that on ten of the claims, there had not been $500 worth of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.758" offset="6646366">The hearing examiner found that, as to five of the claims, Mr. Coleman had established the market and held five valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.715" offset="6690252">Both sides appealed and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management said three claims and part of the fourth were valid and then it goes to the Secretary and the Secretary decides, as I read his Decision, and this was the Decision written by the Deputy Solicitor for the Department as he's authorized under their regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.025" offset="6779486">The Decision was that, “Because this stone is a common variety, and because Coleman had not demonstrated the market prior to the enactment of the Common Varieties Act, July the 23rd 1955, all of the mining claims were invalid”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.815" offset="6878647">Now, the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.208" offset="6916159">Does the mining claim, even one would relate to building stone have to be claim for valuable mineral deposits, translating that a “valuable deposit of building stone”?</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.213" offset="7128273">We have pointed out that if that is not the rule - there are no laws or cases – and I might state that there interior decisions that are adverse to that position, but our position is that if the law of discovery is the applicable law under Section 30 U.S.C. Section 22, I mean Title XXX U.S.C. Section 22, it speaks of a valuable mineral deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.487" offset="7241331">And in Castle versus Womble, which is the case this Court has -- where an early land Department's decision which this Court has followed as recently as in Best versus Humboldt Placer Mining Company, this Court said that what that means, “Is there a valuable deposit?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.849" offset="7338820">Is, it's the prudent-man test whether that would justify a man going on the claims with a reasonable expectation of working the claims and eventually, into some sort of a mining venture.</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.371" offset="11724884">Because on page 12 of their brief, they say, “Furthermore, it has never been thought sufficient for a mineral claimant to prove a purely speculative value predicated on some indeterminate future rise in prices or decline in cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.464" offset="11785279">Validation of claims based on conjectural market fluctuation would merely assist private investors seeking to stockpile the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.760" offset="11818402">Now on our Oil Shale case, there is a situation where the Oil Shale was -- there was no commercial market for it but they held that that was a proper case for them to -- for patent to issue because prudent man, considering their perspective value and the possibilities in the future, would invest money with the hope of developing a pane mining operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.686" offset="11950164">Now, that is where I strongly disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.710" offset="11966255">In outside of the area of building stone in the area of mines, I'm from Arizona and copper mine is one of the most important, there had been -- the mining today in Arizona, the ores now being mine today just simply could not have been mined 20 years ago because they were higher grade ores being mined at that time but prudent-man 20 years ago would recognize that the situation with -- that technology would have been improved so they'd be in a position today to operate this mines and I say that that is a proper consideration in determining the prudent-man test and that is perhaps one of our basic quarrels with the Interior Department and I'd say that it's a proper test for all kinds of minerals, whether they be metallic minerals or building stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.188" offset="12208149">Mr. Justice White mentioned the other problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.563" offset="12241586">Bear in mind that the Interior Department in its decision reached the -- made the conclusion in its decision that this building stone was a common variety and, therefore, this July 23 cut-off date would be the proper date for applying their marketability test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.604" offset="12341791">We have -- we strenuously object to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.847" offset="12362794">First of all, the Building Stone Act was enacted for stone which -- an Interior decision back in 1891, it held that ordinary building stone just simply could not be located under the mining laws and that was the reason for the enactment of Section 30-161 or the 1892 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.142" offset="12487973">There was never, in any of the debates, in the Congress or in any of the Committee Report, there's nothing in the Common Varieties Act that said -- suggest that there was an intention to repeal that law and we maintain that the Building Stone Act is still the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.031" offset="12571460">The Deputy Solicitor in the Secretary's decision in this case said: “In view of the immense quantities of identical stone found in the area outside the claims, the stone must be considered a common variety”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.021" offset="12631437">We maintain, this is a building stone and the record is -- there is plenty in the record, the government's own witnesses testified that it was a kind of stone that could be -- which was valuable for building purposes and was popular, I might say, and used to great deal in the area, in the vicinity of this building stone claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.242" offset="12748361">The Deputy Solicitor, where he says that it's a common variety because of the immense quantities of the stone, he is not following their present regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.963" offset="12791202">Because their present regulations 43 C.F.R. Section 35 11.1, which I do not have in my brief, says, “mineral materials, which occur commonly shall not be deemed to be common varieties if a particular deposit has a distinct and special properties, making it commercially valuable for use in a manufacturing, industrial or processing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.616" offset="12893811">Now in this case, admittedly, these building stone is used for in making -- in the operation of -- I mean in the construction work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.011" offset="13327444">First of all, I think perhaps I have to clarify the present marketability rule emphasize again what I said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.165" offset="13351999">The prudent-man rule, note: “Is cast in terms of a prudent-man”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.078" offset="13375718">It doesn't say anything about the kind of mineral you're going to have or anything else and it's talking about a “prudent-man” in a commercial sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.659" offset="13409991">What will he spend his money on?</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.048" offset="13423574">We say and we have reiterated throughout and have often reiterated throughout not only this proceeding but in all discussions with this matter -- on this matter with members of the mining industry and with people that we do business with, we have said all along that the prudent man would ask himself this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.238" offset="13504345">Now, with respect to copper, I note that in the morning paper that one of the big companies has raised the price of copper to 42 cents a pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.693" offset="13542170">You can look in the Bureau of Mines Handbook, which is a publication put out annually by the Bureau of Mines or perhaps at intervals every year or so, they put this out and you can find out what the quotation is for almost all minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.673" offset="13594102">But what is for saying in graph?</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.905" offset="13602983">What is it for building stone?</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.911" offset="13611029">No one knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.199" offset="13616149">So, we are saying something -- incidentally, there's something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.631" offset="13629942">If you have copper, you can sell it for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.694" offset="13642167">If you have gold, you can sell it for $35 an ounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.083" offset="13655751">Sometimes, you sell it for more but you can sell silver, you can sell all of the metallic minerals and most of the non-common variety minerals can be sold in various places in the country at a price that you can ascertain in advance and that we can ascertain in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.859" offset="13734849">But when a man is going to start a sand and gravel operation or a building stone operation, we don't know whether he is going to be able to sell anything or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.944" offset="13763166">There isn't any place we can turn to see what the quotation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.401" offset="13776959">So, we have required only that he presents some evidence of marketability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.834" offset="13798693">Now, we're still talking about the prudent-man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.558" offset="13809560">So, the question that was asked: whether we could think about a prospective market.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.634" offset="14721860">Now after my discussion with Mr. Justice Fortas, what I'm saying is that if the evidence was prior to 1955, that one could reasonably anticipate that he could market a stone, he would have been a prudent man to make an investment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3695.189" offset="14884133">Alright, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.741" offset="14890297">The Act says that “A deposit of common varieties of sand, stone, gravel, pumice, pumicite, or cinders shall not be deemed a valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of the mining laws of the United States”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.159" offset="14947976">Now, mind you, this was to take these minerals out of the locatable class or discoverable class after 1955, but it didn't effect valid mining claims theretofore located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.815" offset="15006595">In other words, if the evidence didn't exist that before 1955, before this date in 1955, a man could have marketed his stone at sometime and so that he would be induced as a prudent man to invest his money, then if afterwards such evidence came to light or such evidence was created by a turn of events that suddenly everybody wanted mark – wanted quartzite or something like that but this was not anticipatable anything else in advance, he can no longer get a valid mining claim for building stone, if this is a building stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.252" offset="15168345">That is the point that I'm making; that these are different, these are really different issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.479" offset="15185272">The first issue is this: that before if it's a common variety, he could have located such a valuable deposit, he could have located it before 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.142" offset="15227904">If it was a common variety and valuable and marketable and everything else, he can't locate it after 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.347" offset="15252773">So that really, we have two questions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.145" offset="15259982">The case was tried in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.516" offset="15273462">The question had to be: did he have a valid mining claim before 1955?</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.249" offset="15300420">If he did, he gets a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.541" offset="15305540">If he didn't, he doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.196" offset="15312123">It doesn't matter if something develops some turn of events that wasn't anticipated before 1955, it doesn't matter that if in the future, in 1970 or 1980, that suddenly there may be a market for this stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.237" offset="15376280">He can no longer locate, he can no longer validate his claims.</text>
