            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="14.543" offset="161520">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.877" offset="174895">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Tennessee's Supreme Court and it presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.414" offset="201017">Each of which has been discussed at some length already this week: First, the right to jury trial in at least certain criminal contempt cases and second, the validity of the search without warrant of an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.283" offset="260472">The issues arise in this case however in quite a different context and since that context may shape the resolution, I'd like to describe it at least at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.376" offset="300910">We begin here with the strike being under taken by the employees of the respondent company against the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.777" offset="330480">Petitioners were striking employees of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.743" offset="350333">At some point during the strike, the company went into the Tennessee Court of Equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.236" offset="368306">They are still separate courts in Tennessee and it got an injunction against certain conduct by the striking employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.061" offset="399653">The provisions of that injunction relevant here enjoined conduct which quite clearly was conduct already proscribed by the criminal law of the State of Tennessee specifically it enjoined the striking employees from injuring or harming those employees of the company who came to work or visitors or other people who may come to the company during the period of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.879" offset="498918">Now, of course it's undisputed and the company acknowledges in its brief that this conduct which was enjoined and indeed for which the petitioners ultimately were tried in contempt is a felony under the state law of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.728" offset="562239">Sometime after the injunction was issued and while the strike was continuing, a shot was fired into the home of one of the employees who was working during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.855" offset="602781">This home was some 25 miles from the plant in the next county.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.398" offset="620962">The shot was fired from an automobile as the automobile raced away the occupants of the house returned fire and manage to hit the car with one bode in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.385" offset="664952">Deputy Sheriff Powers who is a sheriff in the county where the plant is located and who was at the time the record doesn't quite clear about 15 or 20 miles from the scene of the shooting, received the report over his radio that a shooting had occurred that car was apparently headed in the direction of his county and that it was an old make model car.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.586" offset="757739">He expressly testified that that is all that he received over his radio in terms of a description of the car and when asked, Did you get a specific description?</text>
            <text syncTime="172.029" offset="791489">He said, No, that's all I got.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.517" offset="797445">It was an old make model car.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.487" offset="809357">As he was driving along, he saw an old make model car coming in the opposite direction that quite equipped and he turned around and followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.323" offset="844675">He testified that was going some 78-80 miles an hour, he couldn't catch up to it and so he radio the head to the police in the next town which happens to be the town the plant is located in, to stop the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.885" offset="894934">They did so Sheriff Powers is then as they were stopped, caught up, pulled up along side.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="203.036" stopTime="207.431">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="203.036" offset="915519">Did he tell them what kind of a car it was?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="209.869" offset="942895">That the officer who radioed the head, tell what kind of a car it was?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="213.999" stopTime="333.627">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="213.999" offset="959404">Well, all the record shows Sheriff Powers says he radio the head and said I'm chasing an old car and I can't catch it please stop it.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.695" offset="986154">That's all he recites having said.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.746" offset="998379">He did testify that he didn't know at this time any more about the car except that it was an old car.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.460" offset="1021262">To that, I assume is all that he could've radio the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.233" offset="1036309">At any rate, the car was stopped and the car which was stopped we know is petitioner's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.796" offset="1058565">Sheriff Powers pulled up alongside.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.786" offset="1066506">Petitioners were still sitting in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.573" offset="1073716">He came over, there was apparently a brief conversation not recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.556" offset="1093569">At the end of which, Sheriff Powers told the occupants of the car petitioners, I'm going to take you down to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.437" offset="1129096">He did not tell them what the ground for taking them was he just said, I'm going to take you down to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.437" offset="1157099">The petitioners came out of their car and apparently we're taken in Sheriff Powers' car to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.338" offset="1180714">No search was conducted of the car at this point on the highway, but the car was separately brought to the jail and was parked right outside the front door of the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.212" offset="1228257">Sheriff Powers then testifies, I took the defendants petitioners inside the jail and sat them down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.258" offset="1260440">I told petitioner McKinney who was the driver of the car that he was under arrest for reckless driving and I then went outside and I searched the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.391" offset="1300982">Now, there is no contention here, I think it's important to emphasize this at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.756" offset="1318431">There's no suggestion, this was an administrative search.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.753" offset="1330343">There's no suggestion that there were any regulations in McMinn County Tennessee for searching every car that was impounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.756" offset="1358346">Indeed, there's no suggestion in this record that this car was impounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.683" offset="1370154">All we know is that the car was brought to the jail as in Preston that was the case and as the Court suggested in Preston for all we know it may have been for the convenience of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.196" offset="1420204">Following the search of course uncovered a gun and so an ammunition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3682.474" offset="14833246">Now, in the Sheriff case, the federal case why it provided of course that the six months was -- I mean was the ruling was of test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3707.153" offset="14931989">I mean, throughout the arguments presented by the petitioners they indicate that because what they did in the State of Tennessee was a felony that they were entitled to a jury trial but in effect what they were been tried for was the violation of the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.799" offset="15034598">Now, there are some comment concerning the reason for the court order and so forth, I might point out that the injunction order which was handed down, which was issued in the case was an agreed order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3776.321" offset="15208678">Now, in this case it -- I mean it goes back to a question as whether or not the Sixth Amendment applies to the states even in the jury trial through the Fourteenth Amendment and certainly it's our position that had this case a reason in the federal court system with the maximum penalty of 10 days in jail as provide by law and a $50.00 fine that in a federal system that this punishment would be -- I might say, this punishment would be proper under the Sheriff's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.902" offset="15398954">And to say that it would not be proper in the State of Tennessee where there is in some question is to whether or not the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendment apply to the jury trial question in state court.</text>
