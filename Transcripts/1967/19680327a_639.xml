            <text syncTime="51.296" offset="308537">The mother was a domiciliary of Texas, however.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.341" offset="444688">The nature of the case surrounds itself with the Civil Code of Louisiana as it relates to the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.968" offset="471228">I submit that the Civil Code itself contains equal protection theories especially in Article XXI where the courts are directed to decide cases according to natural reason law, natural reason and equity where there is no precise law on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.646" offset="537997">In this particular instance, 2315 must be considered as the tort doctrine of Louisiana and it is solely the tort doctrine of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.481" offset="617305">The statute then continues with verbiage to grant the right to recover from wrongful death to allow it to survive and to grant this right to “children”, “mothers or fathers”, “brothers or sisters”.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.858" offset="686791">This is the terminology that is used.It has been argued in the respondent's brief in this matter that Article 3556, “Section 8”, which is the definitional article in the Civil Code, defines children as being only legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.733" offset="758262">Children when used around the Code, unless otherwise, used refer to legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.328" offset="784697">It does not include illegitimate children who are acknowledged and it does not include ordinarily what would otherwise be termed bastards.</text>
