            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">No. 726, Robert T. Mathis, Sr., petitioner versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.136" offset="143966">Mr. Friedman, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="13.265" stopTime="224.881">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="13.265" offset="156400">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.453" offset="169148">I’d like this morning in the brief remaining time to discuss two other aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.698" offset="194121">The first is the question whether the use by the government of the forms extending the time for the statute of limitations, the use by the government of those forms as handwriting exemplars violated any of the petitioner’s constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.396" offset="272906">I want to stress at the outset that these forms were not used to prove anything that was stated on the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.458" offset="305194">It was just used by the handwriting expert to compare the signature on the form where the signature on the false tax returns upon which the conviction of filing a false claim was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.235" offset="364335">Now last year, this Court in Gilbert against California held that the giving of a handwriting exemplar did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.224" offset="416266">It pointed out that the handwriting exemplar as such is not a testimonial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.018" offset="439463">It’s not -- does not involve any communicative thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.602" offset="449808">It is just an objective fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.771" offset="458480">The same as the sample of the blood that had been taken from someone and I stress again that in this case, there was no use made of the signatures other than as compared for purposes of comparison between what was shown on the tax return and what was shown on this piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.592" offset="553775">So that under the ruling in Gilbert, there was no need for the agent to give any warning with respect to signing these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.796" offset="602572">The only thing he did was to tell them that there was no requirement that they sign that is that they give the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.135" offset="631933">So we think whatever may be the conclusion with regard to the admissions that he made to the agent, certainly this does not carryover or tainted in anyway the government’s use of the handwriting exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.605" offset="689821">Now the final point I would like to make is in response to the petitioner’s contention that the failure to hold a separate hearing outside of the presence of the jury on the motion to suppress itself denied petitioner’s constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.665" offset="770069">The -- I’d like to just refer briefly to a question that Mr. Justice Fortas put yesterday to my adversary with respect to whether the instructions would be forced.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.338" offset="816776">The instructions are set forth in the record, the Court’s instructions to the jury and the Court’s instructions did not leave any questions to the jury to determine whether or not there was anything voluntary or involuntary about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.278" offset="872469">The judge ruled on that and while the judge did not hold a separate hearing on this issue, all the evidence came in, and motions were made to strike the testimony of the revenue agent insofar as it related to the conversations and also to strike the testimony of the handwriting expert who testified that the handwriting on the returns was the same as the handwriting on these three consent forms and also on the check for the refund which had been given to Mr. Mathis.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="224.881" offset="1002872">Mr. Freidman, I have two short questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.474" offset="1017292">Did I understand you yesterday to say that when the special agent as distinguished from the revenue agent goes to a taxpayer, that the special agent who works out of the Intelligence branch, I gather, always gives a Miranda warning?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="247.609" offset="1093778">Well, I have to qualify, not always gives a Miranda warning, always gives a warning, and the type of warning he gives there is on the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.550" offset="1129618">He gives the full Miranda warning if he takes the man into the custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.870" offset="1146859">He gives a somewhat lesser warning if he is merely questioning him.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>

            <text syncTime="297.222" offset="1292309">It would have to be the former, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.415" offset="1305057">He could not make a recommendation for a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.092" offset="1323760">He merely referred the case to the special intelligent division for investigation.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="312.377" offset="1352913">Well, that means that by that time he made the reference over, he had some basis for thinking that there might have been a violation, a criminal violation here.</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="324.895" stopTime="351.384">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>

            <text syncTime="325.371" offset="1404844">When he referred it over, he presumably concluded there was enough here to call for some criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.948" offset="1443192">And, of course, in many instances, we have some statistics we have developed showing that only a small number of the cases that are actually referred by revenue agents to the Intelligence Division eventuate in criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.556" offset="1665546">I think, Mr. Justice, that refers to one other phase of the case which I’d like to just briefly refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.535" offset="1693550">After the revenue agent had seen this petitioner in the jail the second time and made the reference to the Intelligence Division about three months later, this agent, this man together with a so-called special agent from the Intelligence Division again visited the petitioner to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.618" offset="1793860">At that point, they did give them the warning and the petitioner replied he preferred not to talk about the matter and I think this statement to which you’ve referred at page 97 was just in reference to that, that the jury was not to draw any inference from the fact that when the intelligence man came to him and asked him some question, he said he preferred not to talk.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.705" offset="1914232">No, but isn’t this broad enough Mr. Freidman that’s true that he says in the last sentence and I believe in one case, in the one instance a witness stated that he did fail to answer a question or he did express a desire not to answer any question?</text>
            <text syncTime="465.756" offset="1966373">But before that, it’s a rather general instruction as to the consequence of his being in custody in relation to the jury’s consideration that -- that would apply as well to the first interview and the second interview.</text>
