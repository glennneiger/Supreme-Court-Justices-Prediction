            <text syncTime="27.359" offset="212825">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.893" offset="226931">This is an action by the Kentucky Utilities Company, KU, to enjoin the distribution of TVA power in Tazewell and New Tazewell, two small towns in Claiborne County in Northeastern Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.391" offset="288893">The gist of the complaint is that such distribution would violate Section 15d of the TVA Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.317" offset="316688">That Section was added to the Act in 1959, primarily to authorize TVA to issue revenue bonds to help finance its power program.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.248" offset="360364">It also provided subject to certain exceptions which aren't here directly involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.519" offset="381471">The TVA shall make no contracts for the sale of power which would result in hit for its distributors becoming a source of power supply outside the area for which TVA or its distributors were the primary source of power supply on July 1st, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.758" offset="462451">The TVA Board determined that the Tazewell's' were within the area thus described.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.244" offset="488364">The District Court after a court -- a trial sustained that determination and indicated its own agreement with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.649" offset="522010">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed holding that the TVA Board's determination was of no consequence in making its own independent determination to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.226" offset="572270">There are two issues presented here whether KU have standing to sue and if so, whether the Court of Appeals erred in ignoring the TVA Board's determination in making its own contrary determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.220" offset="744260">I should like first to turn to the facts out of which this controversy arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.981" offset="763277">TVA is a part of this reasonable resource development program to supply as lower cost power in an area of some 80,000 square miles, which is online generally on this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.053" offset="823568">The blue on this map shows the Tennessee Valley drainage basin, the area in which power supply is shown approximately in the pink area and in that portion, the blue that is inside the pink line.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.623" offset="877902">TVA is primarily a wholesaler of power except for supply to some federal defense installations and a few very large industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.715" offset="918235">It distributes its power through some 150 municipalities and cooperatives with whom it has power contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.875" offset="958882">Now, Claiborne County, Tennessee is shown on this map as within the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.603" offset="993782">It's just below the point where the Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia boundaries come together.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.644" offset="1021994">And the situation in Claiborne County on the key date, the key statutory date of July 1st, 1957 is shown on this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.356" offset="1068805">This is a combination of two exhibits in the case -- numbers exhibit -- exhibit numbers 91 and 38.The towns of Tazewell and New Tazewell are shown here in pink.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.670" offset="1126066">KU had a transmission line shown by the solid red line but that serve no customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.524" offset="1153442">It -- distribution lines are shown in the broken red lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.151" offset="1176012">For many years, the electric service provided in the county, it was provided by those distribution lines coming from Hillsboro down to and just beyond the Tazewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.120" offset="1231809">KU made no effort to serve the rural areas of the county and that vacuum was filled beginning in the early 1940s by two distributors of TVA power, the City of La Follette which is located in (Inaudible) west and the Powell Valley Electric Cooperative.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.006" offset="2131362">As I was saying, KU's rates were considerably higher than those of the TVA distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.679" offset="2154036">The towns located on a depressed area were anxious to attract industry and create jobs and they felt that KU's rates were handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.582" offset="2197713">A representative of the towns came to meet with the TVA Board in February of 1960 to see if they could obtain TVA power.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.313" offset="2240658">Also present at that meeting were representatives from Middlesborough, Kentucky located just across the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.795" offset="2278588">The TVA Board at that time advised that the Tazewells were within the area the TVA could legally supply but Middlesborough was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.124" offset="2323832">That I may say was the first application of the 1959 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.222" offset="2344312">A little less than six months after the statute was passed and the then members of the TVA Board, General (Inaudible), Mr. A.R. Jones and Mr. Brooks Hayes had also been directors at the time the amendment was passed and were thoroughly with it -- familiar with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.799" offset="2414529">So I think that's a clear case of contemporaneous construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.544" offset="2437517">The TVA Board also at that time suggested that because of their small size, the Tazewells explore the possibility of getting power through Powell Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.671" offset="2482030">Now the Board had occasioned again to review this matter in November 1962 because Tazewell had gone to Powell Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.619" offset="2521840">They had some exploratory meetings and Powell Valley wanted to be sure that if it supplied power to the towns, TVA would continue to supply the necessary power to Powell Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.334" offset="2576697">That was a problem because that might require TVA to build admission -- additional transmission into the area at a cost of some three quarters of a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.747" offset="2614314">The Board again reviewed the matter at that time and directed that Powell Valley be given that necessary assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.053" offset="2651617">After that, the Tazewells attempted to buy the distribution lines of KU within their limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.212" offset="2684217">KU is not interested in selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.675" offset="2694040">The Tazewell's then decided to construct their own duplicating distribution system and arranged with Powell Valley to supply them with the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.863" offset="2742836">Some customers transferred from KU service to the service offered by the towns in KU then brought this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.763" offset="2786408">Again, in August 1964, the matter came before the TVA Board because as a result of the lawsuit and the publicity attending it, TVA received various inquiries from specific organizations, from members of Congress, from distributors and individuals as to whether TVA might supply power in other portions of Claiborne County.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.786" offset="2874493">And at that time, the TVA made a formal determination that TVA power might be sold within all of Claiborne County.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.532" offset="2913468">Now, I would like next to take up the statute which the TVA Board was called upon to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.749" offset="2958399">I think this pink and blue map is of importance of that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.869" offset="2982849">Not because we think that it exactly shows the boundaries of the area that TVA distributors supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.674" offset="3022033">We think they're very approximate but it does help to show what the Congress had purported.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.998" offset="3047320">This is one of the three generally similar maps which were purported to Congress at the time it was considering the TVA bond legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.186" offset="3080129">That consideration incidentally extended from 1955 to 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.417" offset="3101027">And I think this map tends to show that what Congress was thinking of was a solid expanse, a solid area which might be imposed within a periphery or a perimeter.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.035" offset="3163512">Congress knew incidentally that there were islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.964" offset="3175215">Senate Committee Report shows that clearly the private power service inside the pink line.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.826" offset="3318680">I don't know if that helps but I hope it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.522" offset="3341458">Now, we think that the area for which the primary source of power, TVA or its distributors with primary source of power supply includes everything within that pink line.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.451" offset="3389210">KU's contention is that areas of private power service and indeed, I think any private power customer are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.267" offset="3432469">Now the statute as we see it describes three areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.874" offset="3458905">The first two are included in the first provision -- the first sentence of the territorial limitation in Section 15d (a) and they're described as the area for which the corporation or its distributors were the primary source of power supply in July 1st, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.212" offset="3556185">And we think as I indicated that that meant an area within which there were some prior -- some power supply by others that in which we were the chief supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.261" offset="3608430">Then next, such additional area, extending not more than five miles around the periphery of such area, that is the primary area as maybe necessary to care for the growth of the corporation and its distributors within the said area and we think that by that, the Congress meant a five-mile belt extending around the periphery.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.757" offset="3710412">The Act contains no limitations on TVA service within the primary area.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.560" offset="3737579">It contains certain limitations and service within the peripheral area.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.300" offset="3756596">One of which is that we may not serve within a municipality which is receiving power from another source on or after July 1st, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.077" offset="3807692">Then the Act speaks of what we think is a third area and that is described in these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.714" offset="3842278">Nothing in this subsections, subsection (a) of 15d, shall prevent the corporation or its distributors from supplying electric power to any customer within any area in which the corporation or its distributors had generally established electric service on July 1st, 1957 into which, electric service was not being supplied from any other source on the effective date of this Act which is August 6, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.955" offset="3955231">That we think is a catchall, an insurance kind of provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.110" offset="3975816">Congress knew for example that we were serving an AC complex delivering huge quantities of power to it up here in Kentucky where we moved from that pink area.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.950" offset="4023150">They were serving customer in Tarrant City, Alabama down here.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.432" offset="4049063">There were possibilities that perhaps the distributor lines existing on July 1st, 1957 might have been extended outside the 57 peripheral areas between 57 and 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.327" offset="4108727">We think that that is the meaning of that Section where it was designed to take care of and we also do not believe that it can possibly be read as I think KU raised it as a limitation on the first two areas since it begins, nothing shall prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.334" offset="4188662">We don't think that that can be read dramatically as a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.893" offset="4210918">Now KU also relies on legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.836" offset="4226696">We think that reliance is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.057" offset="4243623">The bill which became Section 15d was past first by the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.798" offset="4262536">And as so passed, it included an amendment offered by Representative Benson which would have prevented with the exception of service to certain named towns the supplying of power outside the service area of the corporation has existed on July 1st, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.129" offset="4339858">Now when the bill went over to the Senate and got before the Senate Public Works Committee, there is obviously a great deal of difficulty with respect to the term “service area”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.047" offset="4375594">One reason being that at that time the only limitation on TVA's supplying of power was that it had to be within economic transmission distance of a TVA dam on the Tennessee River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.405" offset="4428988">That obviously was not a very specific limitation and it was one which is subject to change with technological change and with economic change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.678" offset="4466082">Some members of the Senate Committee, Senator Kerr for one as he said the floor, interpreted service area to include everything that we might then supply as being within economic transmission distance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.621" offset="4529821">Then other members obviously thought it was so much a narrower provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.624" offset="4553853">It would appear that Congressman Benson himself may have intended it as a narrower provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.089" offset="4575692">But in any event, the Senate Committee decided, so they said in their report that it was a nebulous term difficult to define and it's substituted the term area for which TVA was the primary source of power supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.729" offset="4646327">Now I don't think if there's any question about what the Senate Committee meant when it used that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.675" offset="4670046">It's said expressly that that term meant the area in which TVA was the chief or principal supplier of power on July 1st, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.068" offset="4723649">It also said that while its version of the bill which would have permitted us to serve everything within the area for which we were the sort -- the primary source of power supply plus an additional 2000 square miles or 2.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.360" offset="4792822">It said that that version would permit elasticity and adjustments, adjustments on the periphery of the area presently supplied and within that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.571" offset="4837648">It made pretty clear what kind of adjustments to have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.044" offset="4851545">It said, within the general area receiving TVA power, there are small areas served by a private power entirely surrounded by the lines of TVA distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.953" offset="4899192">There are also many areas in which the lines of TV -- of distributors of TVA power and the lines of private power companies were interlaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.350" offset="4936808">And we think that describes the situation in and around the Tazewells as well as any can possibly could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.234" offset="4968260">Now KU says that the Senate Committee report is irrelevant because after the bill was reported out, there was adopted what was one small change was the final version of the bill, an Amendment cosponsored by Senator Randolph, the Randolph Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.439" offset="5049135">KU says and the Court of Appeals said that this Amendment was in effect a return to the House version of the bill considered in a stricter sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.510" offset="5089364">Well, we just believe that that is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.265" offset="5104410">It certainly wasn't for one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.831" offset="5114650">It included the five-mile belt which the House Bill certainly didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.561" offset="5137638">It included the third area which I mentioned which the House Bill certainly didn't but most importantly, it retained the language area for which TVA was the primary source of power supply after the Senate Committee had made perfectly clear what it meant by that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.299" offset="5220603">And the Senate Committee's explanation incidentally of course accords fully with the dictionary meaning of the term “primary”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.422" offset="5249024">Primary means first in rank or importance, chief or principal which is just what the Senate Committee said it meant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.422" offset="5597080">Now the Randolph Amendment, we think also designed from the use of the statutory language as the Senate Committee had explained with the elasticity and adjustment both on the periphery and within the periphery, the Randolph Amendment did not change that basic concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.277" offset="5692479">Also, Senator Randolph had made very clear in his supplementary reviews to the Senate Report what his problem was with the Senate Committee version of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.405" offset="5736991">That version as I said permitted this to supply an additional 2000 miles without limiting it to anything necessarily contiguous to the primary area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.342" offset="5788714">And he was afraid that we might run a narrow corridor and perhaps a couple of miles and with a long distance away perhaps as he put it even getting up to his homestead of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.684" offset="5838137">The final version keeps the 2000 mile limitation on the peripheral area but it limits it to the five-mile belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.679" offset="5882128">Now KU also relies on some subsequent legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.730" offset="5910340">In 1966, which we think directly contradicts its theory, the original 59 legislation that authorizes to issue bonds in the total amount of $750 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.999" offset="5967391">The 1966 legislation increased that to $1,750,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.758" offset="6002395">At the time that legislation was before the Senate Public Works Committee, the Jackson Purchase World Electric Cooperative appears before the Committee and asked to be specifically -- asked that it be named specifically in the legislation so that TVA could serve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.592" offset="6069791">Jackson Purchase served an area up here in the extreme portion of Northwestern Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.390" offset="6096959">It was a customer of KU.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.575" offset="6105631">It had come to TVA and asked that we serve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.998" offset="6119320">The TVA Board had determined in that case that we could not legally supply it under the terms of the 1959 Amendment and Jackson Purchase there upon filed suit against this for mandatory injunction as a preference customer to seek an order requiring that we serve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.103" offset="6187760">That suit was pending at the time of the 1966 hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.499" offset="6213360">The Senate Committee denied Jackson Purchase's request and in doing so, it discussed the meaning of the amendment adopted in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.359" offset="6260799">And it is interesting to note that Mr. Randolph submitted the report for the Senate Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.820" offset="6278666">He was now a Chairman both of the Senate Public Works Committee and of the Flight Control Subcommittee which considered that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.265" offset="6312417">And that Senate Committee report speaks just as did the 59 report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.345" offset="6336763">It says, the Act permits an increase in such area of 2.5% or 2000 square miles which ever is the lesser or of which TVA was the chief or principal supplier of power in July 1st, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.738" offset="6394337">And then it indicated its understanding of what it meant by the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.633" offset="6413876">It goes back and actually quotes from the 1959 Senate Committee Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.500" offset="6441357">On Page 57 of KU's brief, they quote a portion of the 59 Senate Committee report and say that the Senate -- that the Randolph Amendment was a departure from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.272" offset="6480436">Well now here on 66, along comes the Senate Committee and quotes from the very paragraph of that report to which they refer on page 57 of their brief, saying in part, it, the legislation will permit desirable minor adjustments on the periphery of the area presently supplied and within that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.568" offset="6581687">Now, I think if it's once recognized that the primary area is that area for which we were the chief source of power supply, not the sole source of power supply and may include some private utility customers then there is considerable discretion as to how that primary area shall be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.136" offset="6679907">The TVA Board's interpretation of this was that the Act indicated that they should draw stable boundaries, boundaries within the area, the utilities, TVA, and the people could live with, and we think that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.262" offset="6744377">We also think that it was perfectly reasonable and proper in that situation to include the Tazewells as within the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.725" offset="6774262">In fact, we think it had been -- would have been most unreasonable to exclude them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.819" offset="6794637">The determination made by the Board I think was a mixed one of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.058" offset="6819610">The legal part was that as I have said, the area was a single area with a perimeter around it and with some private utility -- islands of private utility service inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.009" offset="6879378">The back portion of it was that the Tazewells were inside the periphery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.086" offset="6911666">This was an executive determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.759" offset="6926399">There is no provision in this Act for notice for hearings and the thing of the -- things normally associated with adjudicatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.001" offset="6963388">It was an executive or management determination incident to the sale of property in this case, TVA power and contracting for the sale of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.579" offset="7005706">Even in the case of quasi judicial agencies, I think this Court has gone a long way in deferring to the construction, contemporaneous construction of statutory terms by such agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.809" offset="7062653">And of course it upholds their fact determinations where there's anything in the record to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.310" offset="7084596">I think that the scope of judicial review in the case of an executive determination is narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.733" offset="7110301">I think the principle has been -- then accepted ever since (Inaudible) against Paul then the case of such a determination unless the Act is in effect a ministerial Act, the Court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the executive agency either as to the law, if there's any question about its meaning, or the facts unless the executive agency is just going clear (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.319" offset="7212596">Now certainly, the TVA Board's determination both of law in fact in this case can hardly be unreasonable where a long experienced district judge after a four-day trial, indicates that he agrees independently both with the interpretation of law and the interpretation of the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.946" offset="7871195">And I think the factors there that are of primary importance are first, that KU has no exclusive franchise to serve in Claiborne County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.667" offset="7914036">It's a non-exclusive franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.721" offset="7922291">And second, that the towns of Tazewell and New Tazewell under Tennessee law are entitled to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.423" offset="7961057">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.592" offset="7965759">The Tennessee Municipal Electric Plant Act expressly gives municipality such authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.757" offset="7990418">Now, KU's theory here is that the competition is illegible not because the towns had no right to compete but because TVA was unlawfully supplying power ot them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.858" offset="8034826">We find it difficult to distinguish their situation from Alabama Power Company against Ickes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.420" offset="8057083">In that case, there was a challenged loan -- there were challenged loans and grants by the Emergency Administrator of Public Works for the purpose of financing municipal construction of electric distribution systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.762" offset="8122389">And this Court said that the utility company could not challenge the constitutionality of federal action, loan some grants which made possible competition which in itself was legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.951" offset="8183202">Here, TVA is not furnishing loan to grants, its furnishing power and we think the basic situation is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.139" offset="8211937">Also, we think that the duty here that TVA owes, is a duty not owed to any private party but a duty owed to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.900" offset="8262928">We think that Congress reserved to itself the authority to determine whether the TVA Board was doing its duty in applying the statute and itself giving adequate protection of utilities as of course we did in the case of Middlesborough and in the case of Jackson Purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.152" offset="8331995">And in that connection in closing, I would just like to read briefly from the Senate Committee Report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.276" offset="8912436">The population on incorporation 1955 was approximately 1040 in Tazewell and approximately 700 in New Tazewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.636" offset="8957889">Now, at the time of the incorporation in 1955, there was TVA customers or two that are distributors, and Kentucky Utility customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.611" offset="9005850">Now as time passed, it came necessary for each town to annex additional territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.718" offset="9042213">In fact, when Tazewell annexed additional territory about the year 1960, it over doubled in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.439" offset="9077112">Now in that newly annexed territory, there were more TVA customers annexed than there were Kentucky Utilities customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.925" offset="9287032">Now, neither town now can annex in any direction into any territory without there have been more TVA customers than Kentucky Utility customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.332" offset="9340740">Now in the 1920s, Kentucky Utilities run a power line down to Tazewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.123" offset="9367907">And all that they have served is along the highway, a small section on the highway and into town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.629" offset="9397896">There are two distributors of TVA power begins supplying electrical power to the rest of our citizens and eventually started serving citizens in the town in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.476" offset="9445230">Now, with these customers located within the towns is that where our problems begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.180" offset="9472084">Now Kentucky Utility rates are approximately 2 and a half times higher than Kentucky Utility rates, I mean the TVA rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.976" offset="9515238">Now that is if anyone won't use the electrical power for your things except electric lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.341" offset="9536763">So therefore, no one wants to live in an area before they cannot be served by TVA power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.088" offset="9567692">Now the property which these black dots, they were agreeing, Your Honor, and we didn't think you can see them from there, so they were applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.483" offset="9621295">So that these are TVA customers located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.804" offset="9638640">Now this has been the original (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.221" offset="9660270">This is an annexed area which resulted in Tazewell about the year 1960 which extended the municipal mandate and all of these black dots are TVA customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.808" offset="9722650">Now people of our (Inaudible) that's where they want to fail or their residential or emerging property, they said they don't want to buy property that which they cannot obtain this power in due to the high rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.548" offset="9789524">Now, going through Kentucky Utilities' brief, it sounds to me that Kentucky Utilities are trying to tell this Court that this is justifiable between Kentucky Utilities and TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.183" offset="9840097">Well, this just isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.231" offset="9852322">I don't know how much TVA cares about serving the town, but believe me the citizens that happily live there do care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.031" offset="9887535">KU seems to ignore the fact that we're just not talking about Kentucky Utility rights or KU rights or the TVA rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.045" offset="9923584">I feel that the citizens of those Tazewells have their rights also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.147" offset="9947930">Now there is nothing in their brief that indicate that they recognize that decisions have been interacted or that there's nothing in their brief where they indicate their concern for the dissatisfaction of the people that give rise to these lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.197" offset="10028178">Now in 1959, the Claiborne County Chambers of Commerce was organized in the effort to locate (Inaudible) to supplement the low form of income which we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.894" offset="10106964">And in fact in 1961, Claiborne County was raised most economic best area from the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.482" offset="10149282">We have had some small success in obtaining the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.769" offset="10162448">In fact, we have located three new small factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.518" offset="10185435">One is located in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.109" offset="10195780">One located in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.500" offset="10205393">And one located in an area which then had been in New Tazewell which is not on this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.186" offset="10232142">And all three of those new small plants, it's served by TVA power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.497" offset="10257324">Now our system believes that we are entitled to TVA power and they can't understand why that we would not be entitled to it when the very backwaters of the first dam ever built by TVA is within three and one half miles of our municipal boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.448" offset="10553135">Unless TVA is to be permitted to expand its service to include the entire country, there must always be a border between TVA on the one hand and investor owned utilities on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.710" offset="10610186">That border will always be a top situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.663" offset="10626069">The investor owned utilities and I do not propose to get into the philosophy of public against private power but the investor owned utilities cannot pay federal and state income taxes in the full capital cost of their facilities and still sell power as cheaply as TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.510" offset="10693360">There are two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.206" offset="10704227">One is to give this tax free power to whatever group happens to be just outside the current border, Tazewell and New Tazewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.243" offset="10740381">If you do that, you have not eliminated the border problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.430" offset="10757099">You simply push them back to another area where they will reoccur next year, a different group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.221" offset="10780296">The second alternative is to draw a boundary as of some given time and say that's it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2675.982" offset="10807254">In the 1959 statute, Congress adopted the second alternative.</text>

            <text syncTime="5261.531" offset="21149445">Second, further study and consideration will be necessary for TVA to decide whether or not they can supply power in Tazewell and New Tazewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.626" offset="21185912">If the TVA Board have resolved that question in 1960, no further study would have been necessary in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.758" offset="21214438">Any consideration of administrative discretion in this case has to be confined to action which the TVA Board did take on August 26, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.015" offset="21255398">The defendant started taking our customers in October 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.109" offset="21271803">The lawsuit was filed November 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.564" offset="21285595">On August 12, 1964, five weeks before trial of the action in the District Court, we took the deposition of Mr. Wesnar (ph), TVA's Manager of Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.667" offset="21326033">In that deposition, Mr. Wesnar (ph) admitted that he did not even know where the Cumberland Gap was in Claiborne County, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.472" offset="21353305">More significantly, Mr. Wesnar (ph) admitted that TVA had not undertaken to locate its boundary as related to Claiborne County and then he did not even know how you would go about fixing that boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.697" offset="21402206">That testimony in Mr. Wesnar (ph) deposition on August 12, 1964, undoubtedly suggested two things to those in TVA in charge of the conduct of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.076" offset="21439718">First, it suggested a weakness in their position in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.922" offset="21455078">They have determined that they could take the Tazewells but they have not fixed the periphery which they now say is all important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.621" offset="21477857">Second, it undoubtedly occurred to them that an administrative discretion defense could be developed because in the two weeks following, Mr. Wesnar's (ph) deposition, they prepared two memoranda for the TVA Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.378" offset="21524877">And on August 26, 1964, TVA made it only determine -- TVA Board made the only determination it ever made in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.254" offset="21564374">That determination was made nine and one half months after the suit have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.191" offset="21584123">It was made two weeks after Mr. Wesnar's (ph) deposition and it was made three and one half weeks before trial of the action in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.117" offset="21619858">The Sixth Circuit course -- Court twice accurately characterized this determination as having been “adopted” to sustain its position in this lawsuit and second, as made for the purpose and on the eve of trial and it unquestionably was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.553" offset="21689553">TVA says that in this case, so much expertise, knowledge and information, is necessary that its Board is the only one who could make this determination fixing its periphery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.239" offset="21732289">As I say, the Board determination was made nine and a half months after the lawsuit had been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.711" offset="21750262">Interrogatories, depositions had been exchanged and taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.035" offset="21763532">All of the map exhibits have been exchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.113" offset="21771786">A wealth of information including the more than hundred exhibits in this file had been developed and it was known to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.841" offset="21798745">The TVA Board was given a very minute fraction of that information although it was readily available and it made its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.690" offset="21826121">Mr. Wesnar (ph) and TVA's then general counsel each in their two memoranda acknowledged that there are two areas in the county where KU and only KU has served.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.371" offset="21868857">One over here in (Inaudible) in the west part of the county, another one Harrogate, (Inaudible), Cumberland Gap, customer south of the Powell River which is in our corridor crosses it and the Tazewells.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.829" offset="21926640">Despite having acknowledged those facts as to service area, TVA's general counsel, his memorandum includes the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.330" offset="21956733">The closer question is whether the periphery should be drawn to include all of Claiborne County or should dip down to exclude Mingle Hollow and again to exclude the area in the vicinity of Cumberland Gap, having acknowledged the fact that he then said that this is a matter for the Board to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.204" offset="22028204">Well, it isn't a matter for the Board to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.038" offset="22035519">It's a matter of fact as to where their area was and they went through the motion and made a determination as the Sixth Circuit repeatedly stated contrary to the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="5522.247" offset="22192358">This question of standing under this particular statute has been before six federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.484" offset="22213360">The four who heard this case, Judge Henry Brooks in the Western District of Kentucky and Judge Smith in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.981" offset="22239274">Each of the six has concluded without question, without dissent that standing exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.588" offset="22257768">Judge Brooks on that matter of purpose of the legislative history of the Act leaves no doubt but that the provision was passed for the protection of private utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.023" offset="22291414">The Sixth Circuit said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.390" offset="22304893">I think rather than what TVA does not really dispute at that point, it's acknowledged in effect on its brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="5573.835" offset="22398725">On page 10 of their current brief, they acknowledge, to be sure a desire to afford some protection to adjoining utilities appears to have been one of the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.276" offset="22428505">And then they say, a purpose to protect is not the equivalent of the creation of a private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.972" offset="22451284">They acknowledge the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.280" offset="22460479">Now all of the judges have found that as I say all six have found standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.615" offset="22473853">I think TVA's basic argument on standing to sue is what we consider to be a definitely superficial argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5601.757" offset="22510425">You're all familiar with the decisions in Alabama Power against Ickes and the other electric utility standing cases where the plaintiffs were really challenging some underlying loan activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.271" offset="22560475">They were -- the plaintiffs in those cases who were challenging the propriety or legality of the actions of the lending officials to make the loans or the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.560" offset="22597569">And the courts in those cases said, the plaintiffs as to that matter are simply members of the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.978" offset="22627244">They have no standing to question the legality of the action of the REA Administrator making a loan, that character of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.057" offset="22655561">Now TVA tries to get under those cases by saying that we're not here complaining of competition by TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.781" offset="22686490">We're complaining of competition by the cities, by the towns of Tazewell and New Tazewell and even Powell Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.318" offset="22708642">Well, there are two ways in which Congress itself entered that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5655.627" offset="22725883">This statute first prohibits contracts which would have the effect of making TVA or its distributors the source of power supply outside this described area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.618" offset="22773844">Second, to give even more certain effect to its intention, Congress prohibited contracts which would have the effect of making TVA or its distributors directly or indirectly a source of power supply outside its area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.571" offset="22825671">We're not complaining of competition from the towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="5683.274" offset="22836433">We're complaining of TVA power in our area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.909" offset="22850957">That is the very thing which is prohibited by the 1959 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.946" offset="22871124">The Act was enacted for the very purpose of protecting the nine private utilities around TVA by keeping TVA power out of their area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.923" offset="22911039">The statute was enacted for that purpose, it prohibits that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.430" offset="22929115">The activity complained of is itself here unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.230" offset="22944266">The National Bank Cases, the Frost Case, all of these are directly in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.202" offset="22964224">We are not complaining of what the town is doing, we're complaining of what TVA is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.237" offset="22980315">It's violating the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.464" offset="22985226">It's violating the expressed prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.704" offset="22994213">Now TVA tells you that it had to act when the Tazewells came to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.169" offset="23016051">That necessitated action on its part.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.311" offset="23028590">But anytime, anybody comes to an administrative officer or agency and request that it do a prohibited act or do an act in excess of its authority, obviously, it has to make a decision whether or not to exceed to that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.761" offset="23090448">And the necessity of making that character of the decision, certainly does not make the decision binding on the courts if in fact it is exceeding its authority, if in fact, it is acting contrary to an expressed prohibition in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.160" offset="23148022">I think in all the standing cases, the most significant question that the Court asked is whether the statute in question was enacted for the purpose of protecting the plaintiff or a small class of which the plaintiff was a party or for the purpose of simply -- some broad pronouncement of congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.260" offset="23244361">If the former situation is concluded to be the fact as to the statute than an individual injured by a violation of the statute has standing to enforce the statutory provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="5802.018" offset="23311444">I don't know any single case in which the courts have held that there is no standing when these things exist and that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.785" offset="23354493">First, we have a charge that the competition complained of is itself unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.750" offset="23378422">Second, the very competition in question not just some remote underlying activity is expressly prohibited by the statute and third, the statute was enacted for the purpose of protecting the plaintiff in litigation against the very act complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.032" offset="23451460">Now, I'm -- had not found any case where those elements were present where standing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.123" offset="23475911">On standing, TVA makes one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.597" offset="23489808">They say that because the statute is silent, it does not give an express right of civil action non-exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.819" offset="23510601">I think on that, we just simply cite to you this Court's decision in Stark against Wickard where the Court held that where all of the element of standing exist, the right, the violation, certainly where its -- one expressly prohibited by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.913" offset="23563055">There's a right of action to enforce the statutory provision even though the statute is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.804" offset="23594611">I would like in the remaining couple of minutes to go back and make plain what I think to be the key matter on the merits which I don't believe have managed to make claim yet -- I think I failed in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.076" offset="23643721">TVA says that somehow by use of this word primary, it may go -- it may draw its periphery out somewhere beyond the outermost limits where its facilities and customers and those of its distributors exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.798" offset="23718536">It says that it may include within its area, facilities and customers of another utility because of the word primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.255" offset="23748420">That word primary came in the statute, clearly under the legislative history for this reason where lines of -- an adjacent utility and those of TVA distributors in fact interlace in the manner indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.074" offset="23799620">It is impossible to draw a boundary at any location without including facilities and customers are one in the service area of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.021" offset="23835460">That's what primary means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.976" offset="23843297">Here, we don't have that factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.942" offset="23851133">We have a sharp boundary with TVA and its distributors on one side and KU on the other throughout this entire -- I'm reluctant to use the word corridor, peninsula of service area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.069" offset="23891675">Where that situation exist, there is nothing in the legislative history or words of the statute which would permit TVA to go beyond the outermost area where it has facilities and customers and relate a part of our area by use of this word primary and take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.211" offset="23960221">I'm sure that you always hear from every respondent that the Circuit Court decided the case directly and gave it utmost care and attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="6016.130" offset="24167842">Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.458" offset="24177246">I first want to deal with this question of specific municipalities because there is in the statute 15d an expressed provision relating to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.240" offset="24216325">And it starts again with the language nothing shall prevent service to certain named municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.217" offset="24244224">Now the way that got into the legislation was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.943" offset="24255195">Those -- most of those were added in the House at a time when it adopted the Benson Amendment with its service area limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.106" offset="24291767">When the matter came before the Senate Committee, other municipalities appeared with their Congressman, their Senators and I think just about everybody who asked for such a specific exception got one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6058.664" offset="24338056">Now, the Senate Committee reported out its version of the bill with those exceptions still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.525" offset="24361462">And it was logical that they should because there is no assurance of that time what final -- what form the bill was going to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.725" offset="24386226">Should it for example go to conference?</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.248" offset="24396361">It is logical therefore to preserve those exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.354" offset="24412766">Further, if I understand KU's brief correctly, it admits that the Senate Committee version of the bill would permit us to exercise the discretion that we have exercised and to serve the Tazewells.</text>
            <text syncTime="6090.409" offset="24465011">Well, all of those exceptions were included in the bills as were reported out by the Senate Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="6113.101" offset="24555813">No sir but I think we were in Cumberland County as a whole and I think that the Tazewells were islands inside that primary area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.299" offset="24600534">Now with reference to these maps, we did prepare as Mr. Marshall said, a number of maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="6130.670" offset="24626030">And I think if you look at them, you will see that they are virtually artist's renderings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6135.122" offset="24643897">They had nothing to do with the question as presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.380" offset="24656854">And they just didn't take into account that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.531" offset="24673468">Now, if we are going like -- by something like that, I might in reply say that before the House Committee, KU presented a map.</text>
            <text syncTime="6151.242" offset="24708368">Its sheet 8(b) of Exhibit Volume 1 and it shows the Tazewells within what they call the TVA service area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.161" offset="24743999">I don't think that the situation can be decided by maps that were not prepared without reference to the question at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6167.694" offset="24774196">The only such map as Exhibit 91 and the accuracy of that has nowhere been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6175.147" offset="24803976">Now they talk about the Roe-Osborn map.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.956" offset="24819231">That map was prepared in 1960 by two local managers of KU and Powell Valley respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="6188.093" offset="24855698">It was never accepted by the Powell Valley Cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.299" offset="24872521">In fact, when KU presented KU with the 1961 proposed agreement which called for a territory agreement based on those maps, Powell Valley refused to accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.398" offset="24921004">Moreover, on that Roe-Osborn map if the Court will examine it and it is Number 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.516" offset="24977429">That map itself shows that there is a separation between what KU claims are two of its areas of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.760" offset="25022464">That separation occurs right here where the line of Powell Valley crosses, so that their, it seems to me under any theory of the case, we incidentally had a large blow off of that so that the Court could see it more clearly and we outlined in pink so that it could and you will notice that there is a separation just at that point between their so-called corridors so that under area (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6257.497" offset="25133328">This is an island inside the TVA periphery whether it's drawn there or whether it's drawn where we finally drew up here at the state line.</text>
