            <text syncTime="28.777" offset="218467">This case comes to you on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court and it involves alleged racial discrimination in prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.264" offset="276459">The plaintiffs below brought this action alleging racial discrimination in the Alabama prisons and state prisons in the Alabama jails.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.222" offset="328286">And they alleged that the statutes requiring separation of the races were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.989" offset="367365">Now, I do not concede that those statutes are unconstitutional, but my argument before you gentlemen today is to show that even if you hold those statutes as unconstitutional, the case requires modification, the decree should be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.528" offset="457435">It's too rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.090" offset="463705">It destroys unnecessarily reasonable administrative discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.600" offset="497768">Mr. Hare, you say you do not concede that they are unconstitutional, do you contend that they are constitutional?</text>

            <text syncTime="105.390" offset="524936">I make no contentions to that, but I'm not in a position to concede that that they are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.750" offset="550327">I take the position that if you gentlemen do declare them unconstitutional, the case should be revised or that portion of the case should be reversed which destroys reasonable discretion on the part of prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.900" offset="610931">And of course, this case is one of overriding importance, much more important than just the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.427" offset="633083">This is – this was set the pattern for prison administration throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.791" offset="658578">Now, there are two aspects of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.559" offset="677595">One is procedural and I'll try to dispose of that first.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.330" offset="704658">The appellant Frank Lee is the Commissioner of the State Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.990" offset="739349">The appellant, Robert Austin is Warden of the City Jail of Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.329" offset="764740">Now, this was begun in Handle as the class action as to all of the jails in the state, and all of the jailers and the appellees when they brought this case, they alleged that Austin as the warden of the City Jail was a representative of that class of jailers and we say that that is not correct, that cannot be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.256" offset="880410">That a class action the necessary elements for class action are missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.492" offset="905383">Alabama is a rural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.668" offset="914056">We've got 67 counties and many small communities that have their jails, some of them just have one cell caboose.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.823" offset="958673">This -- this order which is directed towards af – Afro appellant, Austin, seeks to bind without these people ever been in the court at all with ever -- without having any opportunity to show that peculiar and unusual circumstances in that particular jails, tries to bind all of the jailers in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.257" offset="1068387">We say that this is not truly a representative class.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.297" offset="1088554">That the defendant there could not represent all of the others and did not, and they were not before the Court and this order should not be binding on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.749" offset="1126379">They ought to have that day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.028" offset="1131499">It's just elemental justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.231" offset="1136306">It's -- is that due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.156" offset="1188028">Well, on what basis -- on what basis did you arrive at that conclusion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="276.186" stopTime="400.435">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas S. Hare</label>
            <text syncTime="276.186" offset="1208090">Well, the City of Birmingham is a Metropolitan City.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.607" offset="1221778">It's the biggest City in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.001" offset="1227421">It's all between three and four hundred thousand and it's got a modern, up to date jail and it's a prison, practically a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.335" offset="1264724">It's like a well-run prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.113" offset="1275800">Whereas our rural jails just one man -- just one man operated and frequently not anybody there at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.593" offset="1309759">Frequently, there is no jailer around.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.415" offset="1321044">If there is any -- should be any trouble or any strike that would break out racial or otherwise it -- they have to anticipate it as best they can and separate the prisons as the judgment requires as best as they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.628" offset="1377886">Now, that's true though of the entire system, but what I'm -- the point I'm making is that the rural communities, their problems are not just saying as the problems in the well-run, well-organized, well-financed Birmingham City jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.200" offset="1448208">So, I don't want to take too much time on that procedural aspect because the heart of this matter is the merits, not that just procedural problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.094" offset="1487705">Now, there is one other procedural problem and I'll raise these though primarily because there's been no intervening hearing of this between the trial court and you gentlemen because it came on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.553" offset="1545592">Now, it had just been argued in the Court of Appeals, that is another appellate court, that issue would have been resolved there and we could just get to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.702" offset="1594180">But there is one further procedural thing that I want to point out and that is Commissioner Frank Lee, the Head of the State Prison System, under the court's order is required to supervise not only his prisoners, but the jails of Alabama, supervise the desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.852" offset="1682787">Now he has been given responsibility while he has no authority.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="400.435" stopTime="404.249">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="400.435" offset="1705148">Does he have any jurisdiction at all over the jails?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="404.249" stopTime="435.888">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas S. Hare</label>
            <text syncTime="404.249" offset="1720404">Only on those jails in cities above 10,000 and most of our -- well, I wouldn't say most of our jails, yes, I guess most of our jails though in cities under 10,000 a great number are anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.526" offset="1781426">So, we seek to have the Commissioner of prisons relieved from that part of the order which requires him to supervise something that he's got no authority, they just ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.904" offset="1839000">Now, the importance of that though --</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="435.888" offset="1846941">Do you concede that it should apply to him as to all jail as 10,000 --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="441.067" stopTime="688.814">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas S. Hare</label>
            <text syncTime="441.067" offset="1867630">I concede that he can supervise those or that he can make reports as to those above 10,000, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.653" offset="1902007">But I do not concede that he should because I think as we get to that both to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.127" offset="1919875">Now, when we get to the merits we would see that but the two points I want to make of procedural – procedure, are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.146" offset="1951953">Number one, the warden of the City Jail of Birmingham is not representative sufficiently of that class for you -- for that Court to make an injunction so to speak, where that you could move directly against these other jailers without giving them their day in Court just doing the ordinary due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.873" offset="2034813">That's the first point of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.877" offset="2042859">The second part of procedure is we seek to have Commissioner Lee, who is the appellant in this case; we seek to have him relieved from this responsibility of seeing that all the jails are desegregated and we seek to have him relieved of the responsibility of making 90-day reports periodic.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.380" offset="2148916">Now, there are two aspects of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.639" offset="2177964">One relates to the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.019" offset="2195414">The Alabama statutes like many other southern states require racial separation of prisoners, just blank it arbitrarily racial segregation in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.048" offset="2247555">Now that may or may not be constitutional, I make no point of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.470" offset="2273259">I'll say this that the point is if you void those statutes then Alabama -- the Alabama prison systems and Alabama jails are like those of all the other states and like the federal prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.063" offset="2327594">They are -- that they are not hobbled, the prison officials are not hobbled by any arbitrary requirement of separations but now here is the real problem, the second aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.475" offset="2393318">The court in its effort to ensure desegregation went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.845" offset="2418709">They destroyed reasonable, sensible, common sense discretion on the part of the prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.155" offset="2456012">Now, traditionally the Courts have never interfered with reasonable prison management.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.114" offset="2483806">That's just very, very sensitive area.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.010" offset="2491434">You're not talking about school children now.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.198" offset="2500211">You're talking about the most violent, the most vicious element of our society, the most dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.245" offset="2528319">Many of them are wanton killers.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.553" offset="2545560">Many of them are troublemakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.221" offset="2552247">Many of them are just looking for fight and trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.362" offset="2564786">And then -- and most of them are extremely excitable in emotional.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.701" offset="2582131">Now, the weight of my argument to you gentlemen is this, not all is common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.510" offset="2617448">You must at least imagine and argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.326" offset="2632704">You must leave reasonable discretion to the prison officials because we are talking about the safety of the prisoners themselves, the safety of the prison officials and the integrity of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.184" offset="2696129">We're talking about it -- we -- all of us want the prisons run humanely.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.775" offset="2714520">Now, when I -- when I make this argument please don't think that I am urging that the Court cannot take a case of racial discrimination, invidious racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.864" offset="2774810">Of course, that's justiciable issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.072" offset="2787662">The point that I'm trying to make is, this Court must revise the lower court's opinion so that it is in line with the great body of law which allows reasonable, sensible, discretion in prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.610" offset="2857775">We separate that --</text>

            <text syncTime="692.853" offset="2874807">First, to the other appeal here, but when I consider it in light of the first point you made, I must say that I'm deeply troubled because your first point is either extremely technical one or it's a statement to us that Alabama, regardless of our ruling in the particular case would not apply our ruling in particular case beyond its technical limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.471" offset="10545298">One of the reasons perhaps that we do have riots maybe the Negroes do not feel that they can take their struggle out to the streets and into the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.848" offset="10574764">And one of the reasons that's wrong predicament is because that court house in the deep south is always represented to them and an instrumentality of regression.</text>
