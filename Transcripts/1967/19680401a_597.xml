            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Versus United Shoe Machinery Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.268" offset="236440">Mr. Turner?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_f_turner" startTime="36.680" stopTime="363.058">
            <label>Mr. Donald F. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="36.680" offset="250128">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.134" offset="263920">This is a direct appeal from an order of the District Court to the district of Massachusetts in denying the government's petition to modify the Antitrust Decree which is entered in 1953 after an adjudication that the United Shoe Machinery Corporation had unlawfully monopolized the manufacture of shoe machinery in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.515" offset="373426">Now, in the earlier proceeding, the Court found that United was supplying over 75% and probably around 85% of the current demand in the American shoe machinery market, that this constituted monopoly power and that the position of such power violated Section 2 because it was not attributable solely to defendant's ability, economies of scale, research or natural advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.376" offset="496828">The Court found that United's monopoly power was also attributable in short to practices which though not necessarily unlawful in and of themselves were exclusionary of actual and potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.777" offset="554506">Most prominent of these practices was United's leasing system whereby it refused to sell many of its machines and required long-term leases which obligate or pressured lessees to use United's machinery regularly and over a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.010" offset="631411">Now, in fashioning its remedies, the District Court described the purpose of an antitrust Decree in an unlawful monopolization case as follows, and I quote, “Where a defendant has monopolized commerce in violation of Section 2, the principal objects of the Decrees are to extirpate practices where that have caused or may hereafter cause monopolization and to restore workable competition in the market.”</text>
            <text syncTime="165.013" offset="763382">The Court rejected the request by the Government that United be divided into three equal sized shoe machinery manufacturing firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.451" offset="801207">United conducted all manufacturing in -- of shoe machines in one plant in Beverly, Massachusetts, the Court concluded that the government had not shown that the kind of divestiture it sought was realistic or feasible in such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.695" offset="874141">The Court also declined to order a prohibition of all leasing by United which hence finally the government itself had not requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.772" offset="910503">The Court found that in the circumstances, particularly the likelihood that many, if not, most shoe manufacturers could not afford purchase, such a restriction would be undesirable, at least until milder remedies had been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.369" offset="976854">Instead, the Court imposed a variety of conditions and restrictions upon -- upon United's activities designed, and I quote, “to recreate and independent market.”</text>
            <text syncTime="229.911" offset="1023039">These included an injunction against monopolizing and requirement that United offer for sale at comparable terms all the machines that it leases, that certain restrictive clauses be eliminated from the leases and they run for no more than five years, that the United dispose of facilities for the manufacture of various sundry items, that it charged separately for servicing, that it issues a reasonable royalty licenses to any applicant or on all patents held by it, and a few other clauses which I shall not mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.727" offset="1162324">Now, the Decree contained the usual retention of jurisdiction clause providing that jurisdiction be retained, and I quote, “for the purpose of enabling either of the parties to apply to this Court at any time for such further orders and directions as may be appropriate, or the correction, construction or carrying out of this Decree, and to set aside the Decree and take further proceedings, if future developments justified that course in the appropriate enforcement of the Antitrust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.348" offset="1300773">That was paragraph 23 of the Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.200" offset="1312162">In addition however, paragraph 18 of the Decree provided that ten years after its entry, and again I quote, “both parties shall report to this Court the effect of this Decree and may then petition for its modification in view of its effect in establishing workable competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.271" offset="1404426">If either party takes advantage of this paragraph by filing a petition, each such petition shall be accompanied by affidavit setting forth the then structure of the shoe machinery market and defendant's power within that market.”</text>
            <text syncTime="343.386" offset="1476942">United appealed this Decree attacking both the findings and the Decree itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.381" offset="1496900">The Government did not appeal and after oral argument, this Court affirmed for corium simply stating that the District Court's findings were justified by the evidence and support of the Decree.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="363.058" stopTime="367.899">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="363.058" offset="1555623">There was no discussion, was there I suppose, for the opinion of the Decree as such?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_f_turner" startTime="367.899" stopTime="730.728">
            <label>Mr. Donald F. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="368.882" offset="1578924">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.102" offset="1587806">Now, on January 1, 1965 acting under paragraph 18 of the Decree, which I've just quoted, United States reported to the District Court that in its view, United retained a dominant share of the market and that workable competition had not been established in the shoe machinery industry and accordingly petitioned for additional relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.063" offset="1683623">United cross-petitioned to be relieved from certain provisions of the Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.677" offset="1706088">In our position -- in our petition, we ask that United be required to submit a plan under which it would establish an independent full line shoe machinery manufacturing company capable of competing with the defendant in the shoe machinery market, to hold hearings, to assure that such a plan was feasible and equitable, would not result in a forfeiture to defend stockholders, and promised a fair chance of said company being able to compete with defendant, and to grant such other and further relief as might be necessary to establish workable competition in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.460" offset="1861256">United on the other hand asked for a determination that workable competition of the shoe machinery and shoe machinery had now been established and that the Decree accordingly be revised to retain only those provisions requiring United to sell on comparable terms, as well as leases machines to charge separately for installation and servicing and to avoid in its leases certain of the restrictive clauses that the Court had earlier enjoyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.298" offset="1976613">After hearing the District Court on April 11, 1967 denied both petitions, at the outset of its opinion, the Court citing United States versus Swift &amp; Company 286 US 106 stated that its original Decree could not be changed unless the Government made a clear showing of grievous wrong invoked by new and unforeseen conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.883" offset="2094895">The Court found that paragraph 18 of its Decree contemplated nothing beyond that standard and conferred no broader authority on the power of the Court to honor its Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.847" offset="2142751">When read in light of its original opinion, the Court stated and I quote, “The object of the Decree was during a ten-year period not to restore so-called workable competition but to move toward establishing it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="526.650" offset="2209938">Thus, the Court said it was simply inviting information as to how successful the Decree had been in gradually eroding, and that's the Court's phrase, United's 1953 power to monopolize the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.669" offset="2274095">The Court made 16 findings of fact from which it concluded that the Decree was working as had been originally contemplated in the way I just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.307" offset="2320593">It found that United now received 62% of total machinery revenues as against probably 85% prior to the Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.139" offset="2359881">It considered this change satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.501" offset="2373360">In light of such further findings as to the growth of United's competitors, the condition of the secondhand market, new competitive processes and the entry of new narrow line companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.147" offset="2428008">The Court found that United had no exclusionary power over the minor machines and that if the shoe machinery industry were divided into seven submarkets corresponding to the seven stages of shoe manufacturing, it was not clear that United had a dominant position in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.469" offset="2509197">Even if United did, the Court found this was not due to restraints of trade but to United's large funds, white context, superior products, skill and merchandising, efficiency, conventions and know-how.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.837" offset="2578683">The Court also stated that all what it described as artificial barriers to entry had been terminated and it said that if competition was not flourishing in some sectors of the market, it was because no competitor with large financial resources had entered yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.525" offset="2645452">This was found to be so because the rate of return on shoe machinery is unattractive as compared with other machinery markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.127" offset="2679829">And so, the Court concluded that the Decree was still working in its long range task of freeing the market from United's monopolization and keeping the door open for an adequately provided challenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.262" offset="2732387">Accordingly, it rejected United's position as well as the Government's stating that until there are competitors throughout the market, the Decree should stand unmodified.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.347" offset="2776795">Now, since the Court by pretrial order had decided to allow evidence on relief, only if it decided that some modification of the Decree was necessary, no evidence on the appropriateness or feasibility of further relief was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.707" offset="2842206">Now, I think I can summarize the Government's position very briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.462" offset="2869269">Because the Decree after ten years has merely eroded some of United's market power and has left most of it intact, the Government was entitled at the least to a hearing on the feasibility and effectiveness of further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.245" offset="2948368">The Court's refusal to make that hearing available was based in our opinion upon an erroneous conception of the government's right to seek modifications of the Decree, particularly, although we do not necessarily rely on this in light of paragraph 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.711" offset="3022242">Now, as the Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="786.902" offset="3250970">We are not claiming that there is unlawful monopolization in the legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.806" offset="3274585">We are not conceded that the power that United still retains in the market is not monopoly pa -- is not monopoly power.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.848" offset="3390777">For all that we know, United has not violated the antitrust law since the entry of the Decree, so my answer is yes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald F. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="828.765" offset="3418467">The mere fact that they have 62% would not warrant a new antitrust -- a new Sherman Act case, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.179" offset="3452113">Now, we're not -- if I may continue a little on this -- we are not here disputing the proposition that it was appropriate for the Court to enter the Decree that it did at the time that it did, even though as we noted in our brief on that appeal, the Decree was notable for its moderation.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.893" offset="3546990">But it seems plain to us that the Decree has failed to accomplish in a reasonable period of time the basic purpose adverted to by the District Court in 1953 of eradicating United's monopoly power and restoring effective competition to the shoe machinery market.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.368" offset="3632880">Now, we of course agree that the Decree in the passage of time have had a non-insignificant event.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.178" offset="3664123">United's market share in the aggregate has been reduced from what was estimated in 1953 to be over 75, probably 85% of the market to down around 62%, taking the measure which the district judge found and we think correctly most appropriate, that is United share of shoe machinery revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.673" offset="3750013">There have indeed been a substantial number of new entrances into the business by small, single and limited line companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.352" offset="3784808">And generally speaking, alternatives available to shoe manufacturers have been widened by among other things that develop on a new competitive process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.043" offset="4819571">Now, with regard to what the Decree has done in here, we feel it measured against the standard of eradicating monopoly power or restoring workable competition despite what the Decree has done, which I briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.477" offset="4901282">Its effect can only be described as modest and largely unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.058" offset="4923643">United remains by all odds the dominant firm in the industry as the District Court's findings and the record plainly show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.168" offset="4956035">It has 62% of the market taken as a whole and its share of so-called major machines were -- was described by the District Court as far higher than its share of minor machines, so that we can assume the percentages run higher there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.696" offset="5030118">The shares of its nearest competitors are approximately 9% and 7% respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.282" offset="5056449">Together, those two competitors in other words account for barely more than one quarter of the market share of United.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.860" offset="5090826">United offers 115 types of machines on current terms plus 24 on application; its two leading competitors offer only 22 and 5 respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.100" offset="5151744">Now, I think we should also note that it has taken 10 years to achieve the rather modest success the Decree has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.313" offset="5196675">And there's no guarantee that its success to date will be continued in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.577" offset="5217677">The past trends could well be reversed given United's still disproportionate size and broad machine coverage as compared to that of any of its competitors and given the fact that if the District Court's judgment is upheld, United will be finally relieved of any significant threat of more effective relief in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.947" offset="5307120">But I would note that even if we assume that United's market share would continue to decline that approximately the same rate as in the past, it would still hold over 40% of the market and then after 20 years from the date of the Decree with little reason for great confidence that by that time, any of its competitors would have grown to the point of offering a serious across the board challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.277" offset="5528430">All you have, Mr. Justice, is a contention on our part that the judge should proceed to have a hearing as to what additional forms of relief there might be that would be feasible and appropriate and not more destructive than they would be beneficial that that's our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.874" offset="5618918">Now, we would -- with regard to what the Decree has done, I think this question might fairly be raised that if it had been predictable at the time the Decree was entered that in ten years, United would still occupy the dominant position that it has, could it have been persuasively contended at that time if you could have predicted that that the Decree provided for adequate relief, and we think clearly it could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.427" offset="5745037">Now, we then come to the question, did the District Court apply an appropriate standard in concluding that no modification of the Decree need even be considered, and we urge that the Court was clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.060" offset="5807626">As I have noted, the Court took the position that the formula of the Swift case applied to the circumstances of this case as well and required a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions before modification could be Decreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.267" offset="5876485">The Court further held that paragraph 18 of its Decree could not as a matter of law, be interpreted to give it more general authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.123" offset="5911907">And finally as you know, it interpreted the Decree as merely an inviting an inquiry not whether after ten years workable competition been restored but whether it had achieved the object of moving toward establishing workable competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.954" offset="5975228">Now, for the reasons stated in detail in our brief, we believe the Court misconstrued paragraph 18 of its Decree and that it's 1953 opinion rather than supporting its present construction cuts the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.445" offset="6033115">That was certainly the premise on which the government defended the Decree on appeal in 1953 where we set up the Decree, and I quote, “If proceeded on the premise that relatively mild remedies should be tried as a first resort and that the possibility of more drastic measures should be held in advance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.212" offset="6116185">And we immediately thereafter cited paragraphs 18 and 23 of the Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.219" offset="6140217">And I would like to add that if the District Court's interpretation of paragraph 18 came as a surprise to us, which it did, it appears also to have come to -- as a surprise to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.878" offset="6190895">Neither its petition for modification nor its briefs at the conclusion of the hearing carry any suggestion that paragraph 18 merely contemplated and inquiry as to whether the Decree was successful in gradually eroding United's monopoly power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.299" offset="6308551">United attacked the finding of liability and of course on the basis of that claim, there should be no relief whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.959" offset="6423176">If the Swift formula is inapplicable, inapplicable to an effort by the Government to supplement a Decree that has failed as materially as this one has to eliminate a monopoly power that was adjudicated to a violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.953" offset="6495169">And we of course urge that the Swift formula should not have been applied to this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.404" offset="6517008">Now, let me briefly summarize what Swift was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.307" offset="6532577">The defendant Meat Packers and that monopolization case had consented to a Decree enjoining them from selling meat at retail and from manufacturing wholesaling or retailing a wide range of non-meat commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.612" offset="6593808">Over a period of ten years beginning shortly after the Decree was entered, defendants had continuously though unsuccessfully sought to have this Decree vacated or modified by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.305" offset="6648560">And this Court rejected what was then the last attempt in which defendant sought to have the injunction modified to permit their wholesaling grocery items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.285" offset="6688475">Now, the Courts opinion identified two reasons for the Decree hereon from the government's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.025" offset="6715434">Defendants had power to use their distribution facilities to wholesale unrelated items with substantially no increase in overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.775" offset="6746467">And of here, the defendants would lower prices temporarily to a point that would drive out competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.931" offset="6771127">This Court said the Decree had been grown into theory that size carries with it an opportunity for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.214" offset="6796204">This is not to be ignored when the opportunity is proved to have been utilized in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.511" offset="6817416">And the Court concluded that the developments in the food industry would in no way remove what was described as that ancient peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.353" offset="6852733">And the Court then followed with the language we're familiar with that the change should be made on nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2041.655" offset="8270033">Now, just to finish up with regard the Swift, it seems to me it can be a case that is fairly described as one in which the Court was putting -- giving primary importance, paramount importance to the protection of the public interest in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.161" offset="8372015">And to turn that around and to apply the Swift formula where the government endeavors to repair a plainly ineffective Decree, we think it makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.242" offset="8416319">Clearly the paramount public interest is -- in restoring competition is not served by opposing upon the government the enormous burden of making a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.002" offset="8475355">In short, by throwing all of the benefits of the doubt against the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.616" offset="8505866">I think the point would be clear, perfectly clear if Swift were held as a District Court rule to deprive District Courts of even the authority to include in their Decree clauses permitting reopening and further relief on standards less severe than the Swift formula would impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.492" offset="8589354">For that, we'd then force the government and we think District Courts to adopt the most drastic possible relief in each case in order to ensure that the public interest in the restoration of workable competition would be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.199" offset="8656123">Indeed, the imposition of such hurdles on subsequent strengthening of inadequate Decrees would destroy any basis for the approach partially reflected in the original Decree in this case that far reaching remedies should not be employed until milder remedies have been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.741" offset="8738356">It would be impossible in our position that the public -- in terms of protecting the public interest to maintain that doctrine of trying milder remedies in preference to harsh remedies, and then deprive the Government or the District Court of any power to repair the Decree whether this turned out to be substantially defective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.310" offset="9976560">And I think that I can demonstrate by the reference to the findings as to the entry of new competition and the profitability of new competitors that the price control, which you referred to, Mr. Justice White, could not be in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.468" offset="10077288">In fact, I also embrace the further frank statement by Mr. Turner that there is no violation in the maintenance of a mix mere 62% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.806" offset="10130578">But I shall at once proceed I think to try to convince Your Honors that this 62% which has been referred to so much in the argument and in the Government brief is a mere measure taken at a point of time five years ago that there are other measures showing a lower percentage of United's occupancy and that both measures are and have been moving downward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.057" offset="10251577">Conspicuously absent from both the assistant attorney general's argument and the government's brief is the reference to the motion in this market, which is a motion downward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.980" offset="10299329">But before I proceed to that development, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I would further embrace if I may the statement which I think as erroneous by the assistant attorney general that the government had no hearing on relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.254" offset="10364426">Now, it's perfectly true that on this sea day hearing, so-called, as of January 1, 1965, there was no separate hearing on relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.907" offset="10418970">But in the original case which occupied 121 trial days, both relief and liability were considered at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.428" offset="10469125">In our brief, we have called the Court's attention to the fact that the district judge devoted four paragraphs at page 348 of 110 federal supplements to the request for dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.987" offset="10531297">That request was insistently pressed by the Government at that time. And those four paragraphs begin with a single statement which along I will need read, “The government's proposal that the Court dissolve United into three separate manufacturing companies is unrealistic.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.680" offset="10614053">There's factual development of that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.198" offset="10628159">And in the Government's pretrial, the proceedings on sea day, there was no effort made and no evidence adduced to indicate that that position now is in any way different from the position in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.386" offset="10700884">In fact, I may say that it's identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.967" offset="10723244">The Government lost, as I say, its application to dissolve in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.953" offset="10743202">The Government did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.849" offset="10750725">The Government let the Decree go into operation upon this Court's affirmance after the defendant's appeal, which was in effectual in modifying the Decree in any particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.064" offset="10807672">With reference I think to Justice Harlan's question whether the defendant's brief in this Court particularly adverted to the review in ten years by hasty inspection indicates that it did not so advert, that we contended throughout, that the finding of liability was erroneous and not in accordance with previous determinations of this Court and not in accordance with the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.406" offset="10909027">However that may be, I think the government has forgotten that it represented to this Court in 1954 that there was an adequate hearing on relief in the main trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.607" offset="10965765">And I take leave, if I might Mr. Chief Justice, to read a few words from page 141 of the government's brief signed by Solicitor General Sobeloff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.896" offset="11010905">During the case of the course of the trial which took 121 trial days, the district judge heard testimony relating to all phases of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.068" offset="11055626">He patiently examined and studied some thousands of aluminous exhibits which were admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.182" offset="11080077">He had extended opportunity not only to observe what was wrong with United's practices but to explore alternative courses of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.431" offset="11117066">He personally questioned witnesses at a considerable length considering the feasibility of various possible measures for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.443" offset="11149145">Thus, Professor Dean -- Joel Dean was the defendant's economic expert -- thus, Professor Dean was requested by the Court to study a series of questions relating to relief and to testify in relation to each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.530" offset="11205465">He did so freely and exhaustively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.603" offset="11217795">Then there's a reference to the record and I conclude with a statement of the Government counsel in 1954 to this Court, “The careful consideration which underlies the provisions for relief is further demonstrated by the logic, the clarity and the meticulousness of the opinion on remedy and of the Decree itself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.334" offset="11304730">This passage was preceded by statements that the hearing on relief was conducted with a hearing on liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.615" offset="11341824">So to sum up that portion of what I have to say, I would say that the Government is proceeding on a misconception that it has not hearing on relief, that it had a hearing on relief, that partial -- part of its request was denied and it failed to appeal, that the bulk of its request as to a media rating and corrective factors in the market was accepted, and that the operative clauses of the Decree which I shall now like to refer to in somewhat more detail, have been extremely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.967" offset="11491244">I think that the government demonstrates its power in saying, as I remember the language of Mr. Turner, that the Decree has been patently ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.107" offset="11539832">What did the Decree attempted to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.707" offset="11554252">Your Honors, you have it before you in connection with a private trouble damage case which related to the effect of the Decree on the preceding liability and conduct of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.738" offset="11606288">Now, this portion of this case deals with the effect of the Decree upon the market and the defendant's conduct after its effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.305" offset="11660622">And in response to questions from members of the Court as to effective date, I might remind the Court that while this Court's affirmance occurred in June 1954, elaborate provisions for dismantling the leases required some time and the Decree began to operate in accordance with its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.493" offset="11749334">As of June 1, 1955 retroactive January 1, 1955 when the Court approved a very complex plan for terminating all the existing leases at the option of the lessees so that if you look at the beginning of the experience period, January 1 at earliest 1955 up until the date of the statistical studying that was made in this case to measure market share and market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.445" offset="11885171">You have as a terminal date for that study the fiscal year 1963 because while the Court's directive reports as of January 1, 1965, the course of time necessary to collect information from not only the defendant but 125 other suppliers in the field met -- but the time the evidence could be tended to the Court, the fiscal year of 1963 was the last effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.993" offset="12011395">So you had eight years, maybe nine years of effective operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.872" offset="12034905">Now, at this point, five years or four years from this last experience date, you have the government telling you that a decline from 85% of market to 62% which is 23 points in eight years is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.285" offset="12120482">It seems to me with all respect that is a rather curious contention, an untenable contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.908" offset="12150993">I cannot understand the impatience exhibited in the government's approach to the now demanding and renewing this surgical treatment of divestiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.383" offset="14164929">In short, the government petitions the Decree be reversed because this coerced in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.003" offset="14191365">I think he's there referring to dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.546" offset="14201605">Now, as to more direct answer to Your Honor's question, I wanted to remind the Court that conjointly with the statement in 1966 by the district Court, the intention was a gradual erosion of the market power of United.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.312" offset="14276629">You have the statement in 1953 which explains the theory of the Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.594" offset="14305782">As to the secondhand market on page -- well, I have a pamphlet opinion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.843" offset="14342771">As a secondhand market, United will face a type of substitute competition which will gradually weaken the prohibited market power which had now exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.753" offset="14386343">And then again, as to a sales market, the District Court said in 1953, the creation of a sales market together with a purging of the restrictive features of the leases will, in combination, gradually diminish the magnetic hold now exercised by United and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.787" offset="14470562">Now, those passages are at page 350 of 110 federal supplement and there are other similar passages indicating that the judge was relying on the inevitability of gradualness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.328" offset="14528658">Now, since that has worked, I do not think I need to adhere to any position that a retention of 85% would still be defensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.389" offset="14568887">In fact, the 52% that the District Court found on a measure of comparative revenues to be the share of United's revenues, United's occupancy in 1963 a contrast with an 85% eight years or nine years ago, possibly a 92% of revenues enjoyed by United at the time of the original violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.860" offset="14702843">I take the figure of 92% from the government's brief in the District Court, which is repeated in the record on this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.296" offset="14736593">But in any event, if it were only a decline from 85% to 62% in eight or ten years, we should have a magnificent showing in an industry which is a capital goods industry with the machines enjoying a long machine life and with a complicated situation to rectify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.859" offset="14846830">Let me refer a little more fully to what Decree was attempting to do in 1953 as it was then presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.274" offset="14896462">The Court pointed out that while United's conduct had been entirely conformable with the law as laid down by this Court, new developments in the decisions effective about 1946 had made the retention of the then market share by restrictive lease clauses even though similar to those previously adjudicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.671" offset="14994056">It made the retention of market share by those lease clauses now illegal and monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.056" offset="15019551">The Court directed that a plan be submitted, which as done, to terminate at the option of the lessees all the outstanding leases about a hundred thousand in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.200" offset="15068139">That plan took effect as of June 1, 1955 as I've said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.616" offset="15093844">And over a period of time beginning in 1955, all the -- all leases were terminated and potentially a large bulk of the machines then held by the lessees -- purchased by the lessees under the terms of the plan which provided for the calculation of a purchase price, including the cost of capital of the shoe machinery -- of the shoe manufacturers as part of the elements of that purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.419" offset="15245040">So that the leasing system as it then existed was cut out and regardless of whether the option to terminate was exercised by the lessees as of 55, 56, 57 and so on, the Court directed that forthwith these restrictive practices stop and they were stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.635" offset="15349948">The Court also provided that where leasing continued, there should be in the future an opportunity for purchase at a price, which was not a disadvantageous or not especially advantageous to leasing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3869.513" offset="15581393">As I read his opinion, Judge Wyzanski said that in this case the Decree, the government is complaining that the Decree worked as intended but it did not accomplish the result, namely the dissipation of the monopoly without refining that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.537" offset="15689540">Now, he said then -- as I understand Judge Wyzanski, he said that is not -- that is not a legally defensible basis for reopening a Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.534" offset="15745546">And I assume that if we disagree that I'm right to this point and if we disagree with Judge Wyzanski in whole that he applied the wrong standard, then we would remand this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.281" offset="15804479">The competing standard is of course that even if the Decree operated as intended but did not achieve the desired result, namely the dissipation of the monopoly, then the government is entitled to relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4087.861" offset="16454823">-- manner of the erosion that was intended and so stated by Judge Wyzanski in his findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.778" offset="16482513">But it's having the effect of substantially reducing market share and market power of the United as originally held by it in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.812" offset="16538624">We have attached to our brief as tables A, B and C, a tabulation made from the census or rather from United's own machinery shipment records to show the massive changes in the machine inventory and the going out of the old machines and the reduction of control of machines by United.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.667" offset="16646040">Table A taken from United's records shows the 18 major types on which most emphasis was placed because they're the more important machines and as judge said, the 12 minor types showed much less market control by United.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.077" offset="16727646">The 18 major types showing the number that are on lease in 1955, 54,000, the number shipped since 1955, 10,000, the number returned showing a net of returns of 16,000 machines of those pre-55 types.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.613" offset="16825866">Table B separates out the types or models adopted since 1955 and shows on the same basis the number shipped, the number returned, and in both tables, the number sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.195" offset="16888142">Now, the number sold both on what are called conversion or transforming leases into sales or new sales as directed by the Decree are extremely important because they tend to create the secondhand market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.383" offset="16948955">And the position eight years after the Decree is that the great bulk of the machinery that were the instrument of the monopolization found is in the hands of customers or in the hands of the secondhand dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.202" offset="17008201">We have in the record the statements of two secondhand dealers and we have in the findings the bulk of dollar sales of those dealers showing they are substantial in road into the market, so United's former means of monopolization are now a means of competition with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.210" offset="17092211">Now, in table C, we have put together on the same 18 categories a combination of the pre-55 and the post-55 models, so that you can see in combined the total that have been disposed of and how they have been disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.970" offset="17191267">On another table overleaf on page 52 of our brief called table D, we have a say to give the Court in terms of dollars a picture of the movement overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.887" offset="17242885">The movement overtime of not only United's income from leases and sales but the income of the principal competitors whose witnesses we can get on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.200" offset="17296175">There were received an evidence affidavits of scores of suppliers but those affidavits did not contain a picture of revenue year by year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.007" offset="17343404">So as -- so that to show the progress of the erosion that Judge Wyzanski directed, we endeavored to get from the records of those competitors we could get on the stand the dollar receipts year by year to compare in their total with United's receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.549" offset="17425533">And in Table D, you will see that United's receipts went down in the aggregate from $32 million to $24 million, even though the latter figure probably gives some effect to inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.855" offset="17478823">And you will see that these 12 competitors who were the only ones with whom we could get figures had gone up in the aggregate from $3.5 million to $8 and -- $8.10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.599" offset="17533785">Now, of course there's a great deal of variety among these.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.508" offset="17545383">Some of them go up and down, but you will notice that a number like CIC, an English company, only entered the market in 1959, you will notice that Industrial Shoe began to -- number three, began to create a substantial volume in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.958" offset="17631169">And you will notice that International Shoe, one of our principal competitors almost quadrupled its total revenues which are here accounted on a lease basis only, and we couldn't get all their figures for sales for purposes of comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.289" offset="17696580">Now, this -- the judge thought and we submit to this Court, is a substantial picture of movement in time even only to the year 1963 which shows in the only way this record does show it the attrition and the eroding effect of this Decree which took away all the restrictive practices and opened up the secondhand market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.789" offset="17810578">Now, in referring to International Shoe, I would like to mention I think an error in the government brief where they say that there have been -- this is in the reply brief and we couldn't deal with it in writing -- they say there had been no innovations in this market and that is one indication they say of a static monopolized situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.833" offset="17898663">Of course, innovations are important and I point out that International Shoe Machinery Company itself had put into the market during this period the so-called thermolaster just as United Shoe had put into the market the Injection Molder, and I have half a dozen instances of other companies which have put into the market no machinery so as to show contrary to the government's contention that the flexibility and the entry of new forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.819" offset="18038680">In this connection, I asked the Court to look at the brief filed as to my side of the Court by the consumers of this machinery, the National Footwear Manufacturers and the New York -- New England Footwear Association, which argues from the point of view of the consumer the wisdom of the Decree as it affects them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.945" offset="18131153">They say, and I won't endeavor to paraphrase, but they say in substance that as the market stands even not withstanding United's share larger than the others, the competition produced is not only satisfactory for their purposes but is better for their purposes, that if the supplier's market were broken up and destroyed by the introduction of a new full line company per force because they say it's an interesting fact based on what Professor Fox said in his testimony, a new full line company might destroy some of these small companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.584" offset="18285693">There are 125 other companies in the business, most of them relatively small, most of them as the judge says producing only one or two machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.477" offset="18333236">It's somewhat like the grocery situation or other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.541" offset="18353507">This Court has -- had to deal with -- in the Vans case, a lot of small people who nonetheless among themselves have produced effective competition as shown by the erosion of United's share.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.553" offset="18413589">Attached to the - -my side of brief are the sworn statements of a number of shoe manufacturers detailing the kind of competition they enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.746" offset="18466356">And detailing -- and that's why I'm now referring to it -- the entry of new machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.092" offset="18487777">It happens at one of them on page 14a of this amicus brief, is made by a man who's not only a shoe manufacturer but he is also the inventor of a new machine called the Low-ready heel molder and he says, “I can foresee a development in shoe manufacture which will render obsolete United's insole tackers, assemblers, and heel sewn lasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.033" offset="18587460">In fact, my Low-ready heel molder is doing just that now.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4661.860" offset="18750777">I forgot the exact figures of the membership, which are given in the record, but they're a substantial majority of all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.346" offset="18776795">And they say that the existing structure of competition is better for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.702" offset="18806157">They give in many examples of the kind of competition, and I allude for the moment if I may to what Mr. Volanette's of Brown Shoe Company, a name that's famous in this Court, what Mr. Volanette says at pages 21 and 22a, he lists the 18 major categories of United machines which I've called attention to on table A, and he says that while the first five categories of this type of machines made by others and made by United are used fairly generally on the majority of shoes, such of the remainder as the machines for welt sole in seam training, rough rounding, and so on, I won't quote them all, are adapted to dying processes and are used less and less.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.001" offset="19015346">The McKay machine for example has not been used in the last 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.840" offset="19030706">We stopped doing lose nailing ten years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.700" offset="19042200">No stitch done to speak of have been made for the last 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.484" offset="19057351">Now, I adduce these facts and there are many of them on the record to show the Court not only that the United machines have passed for the majority out of our control, but that new processes and techniques have come in which have made simplified manufacture, flexible soles, and cement adhesive available in such degree that the old types of machines that which United had had such a large percentage in 1953 are no longer being put out or utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.183" offset="19200084">I can't say they're no longer being utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.772" offset="19210428">One manufacturer like Nettleton continues to make the Welt shoes using the old types.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.571" offset="19237700">But this record is full of evidence and these affidavits are full of the proof that the coming in of new processes as further obsoleted the United type of control through machinery invented by United.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.272" offset="19296423">Now, it's these facts that make the new processes available to the manufacturers in such degree that they can dispense with the United machines in great quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.344" offset="19364760">And there we come to the relative -- one of the defects of the 62% figure because the 62% figure as a market share figure which Mr. Turner has given his sole attention to is a figure based on revenues received in the year 1963 from -- not only from machine sold, how machines put out on lease in that year but from machines leased in prior years, the old machines, the Welt type for which revenues are received in ‘63 so that the ‘63 comparative revenue measure of United and I admit it's a good measure but that ‘63 comparative revenue measure which make 62% is based largely on all transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.617" offset="19569873">Now, another figure which Mr. Turner did not find time to mention is found in the judges findings as a 48% figure -- a 48% figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.135" offset="19619924">48% represents the revenue measure of the United production shipped in the year 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.516" offset="19665481">This was obtained and it's a very conservative figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.138" offset="19679901">This is found on page 29 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.279" offset="19692440">This was obtained by converting to sale value, the United machines which were shipped on lease in that year in order to make it comparable, we have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.321" offset="19744684">And then taking the sale figures of three of our largest competitors and taking all other competitor sale figures in that year and you will see that in that year, we have 48.6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.809" offset="19794631">Now even that eliminates some lease revenues of the others that we could not put into the table so that 48% is probably a little high and that was the year '63.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.231" offset="19856280">The Government I think is quite wrong in saying it in its reply brief that we claim the 62% figures clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.875" offset="19890866">We never said it was clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.696" offset="19898180">We admit it's a good measure if you want to take in all the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.373" offset="19912913">But from the point of view of what I think would be the interest of this Court as to how the Decree is working, the 48% which is the shipments in that year comparative with the others is the cutting edge of the new business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.979" offset="19967248">The 48% shows how the trend is going and I would assume a 48% in 1963 might be reflected in a lower percent today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.435" offset="20025135">Of course, the Court cannot take the temperature of the market every 5 or 10 years but neither the Government nor we have an information that the percentage is going up rather than down.</text>

            <text syncTime="5627.732" offset="22614288">Since the original Decree was predicated on a machine count as you will find in the beginning of Judge Wyzanski's findings where large percentages by count or attributed to United in the 30 categories machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.151" offset="22680012">We began the trial with an elaborate census of all machines counted in a 47 sample factories which census was then projected by statisticians to the universe of all the thousand factories in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5660.502" offset="22745422">I have in front of me Exhibit d (8) which is that census which resulted in a machine count.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.954" offset="22771231">And the machine count shows that in 1963, the number of machines on lease out of the whole of the others, the number of machines on lease was only 15%, the number of United machines on lease as against all machines in the 47 factories and hence of the universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.580" offset="22897664">The number of machines purchased from United was 31%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.100" offset="22915741">The number of United machines acquired from others and that is the secondhand market was 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.724" offset="22942281">The competitive machines in the field in 1963 was 47%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.022" offset="22975509">This is Exhibit 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.334" offset="22984704">Exhibit 60(a) has similar figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.361" offset="22996825">I will not take further time to elaborate that but I can assure you Your Honors, an elaborate machine count was debated at a great length between counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.609" offset="23041860">A further element that I had asked that I put on Your Honors bench but there may not be time to describe is the basis for the testimony of Dr. Bertrand Fox who testified as an economist to the existence of fluidity, dynamism, full movement, new suppliers in the market and as a basis for that there was put in the evidence the most elaborate study that's ever been made of the process of shoe manufacturing what Your Honors have before you as Exhibit D(54) and which shows -- I'm now turning to Section 4 dealing with lasting which shows that in the method -- in each method, each step a flow through the factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.837" offset="23222732">The shoe manufacturer has available to him in the different operations alternative machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.635" offset="23253870">This illustrates what I said at the beginning, the heterogeneity of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5792.520" offset="23273409">It's not a simple monolithic market as with wheat crashed with aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.181" offset="23300054">These machines differ among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.848" offset="23310712">You do not need all the 115 United types to make machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.993" offset="23331297">As it shown with the testimony to make shoes, you can make shoes with a selection of different processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.730" offset="23358255">Now the witness, some of whose testimony I have adduced as an Appendix to the blue appellee's brief, the witness went through this lasting table and explains what alternatives were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.938" offset="23411127">On the basis of these alternative choices and the break up in the system of machine distribution which the Decree is brought about, Dr. Fox testified in detail in under cross-examination, he is an imminent economist, a colleague known to Mr. Turner at Harvard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.324" offset="23500675">He testified to the existence of full, free competition and the gradual reduction of the United share through the entry of all these competitive alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.430" offset="23553128">I come therefore without spending more time on that to the conclusion of what I had to say to the Court that has a great deal more in the record but I must ask myself, what is the purpose of an attempt to reverse this Decree and send us back to a new count of the erosion?</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.986" offset="23631287">What harm is done by allowing this process of gradual liquidation which has been going on for eight years and now 13 years and will go indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.197" offset="23684159">What harm is done by letting that continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.922" offset="23699101">What is the public benefit of breaking up an existing competitive system which is working satisfactorily and doing the surgical operation of divestiture which will certainly hurt investors no matter what pious phrases are used in the Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.006" offset="23771408">It'll certainly hurt investors, but which the customers themselves do not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.403" offset="23792933">It seems to me that we have a mere economic exercise in how Swift is to be interpreted in some cases that are not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.987" offset="23823339">It seems to me that we have gesture of the impatience which has no reason for the Attorney General to feel in this case and in some, whatever the percentage is that Mr. Turner would accept as an adequate measure after a term of year, say 40% in the case of the United occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.632" offset="23921873">How much time is he willing to give in the slow passage of time for that percentage to be attained?</text>

            <text syncTime="6065.671" offset="24366059">Mr. Turner, before you get in to your argument, would you mind discussing first the last matter that the counsel brought up about the futility of what you seek?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_f_turner" startTime="6081.139" stopTime="6260.677">
            <label>Mr. Donald F. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="6081.139" offset="24427917">I would be happy to Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6085.084" offset="24443695">Mr. Carson asked what harm would be done by allowing this Decree to continue indefinitely if the pace that it is currently been carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.011" offset="24487372">The harm is in our view, the 10 and now 13 years after the government obtained a Decree in this case which it hoped would dissipate United's dominance of this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6108.652" offset="24537945">United by any reasonable test is still dominant and this industry for a workable competition has not been restored to it, there has no prospect that it will within a reasonable period of time if the present Decree is left in tact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.408" offset="24600952">We do not think this is a futile exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6126.648" offset="24609938">Now, the question then may arise, are there other forms of relief including divestiture which might make this Decree more effective?</text>
            <text syncTime="6141.358" offset="24668766">And we think there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.408" offset="24677021">We have not confined ourselves to the alternative divestiture alone although we would endeavor to show if we were given the opportunity of doing so that are feasible ways of affecting this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.456" offset="24729161">There are other things that can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.171" offset="24740028">The district judge in the original Decree determined although it was a rather difficult question that he would not prohibit United from leasing its machines all together even though it was quite clear that the whole system of leases had been an important determinant of United's ability to maintain a big share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6180.407" offset="24824978">It gave it close and continuos connections with consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6184.211" offset="24840234">It may well be at this point given what we believe the obvious failure of the Decree that that might -- that option might now be taken of ending leasing all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="6197.066" offset="24891643">United has secured new patents in the interim, some of these maybe quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.701" offset="24918183">We could ask for again compulsory licensing of those patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.066" offset="24935633">United has a British subsidiary which is an important manufacture shoe machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.355" offset="24956844">If that were divested, it might well become an additional competitive factor in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6219.719" offset="24982235">Now of course I cannot assure this Court that anyone of those forms of relief would absolutely be feasible and appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.838" offset="25022673">I can assure this Court however that the government has good reason to believe that at least one of them would and we are requesting a hearing in order to have that opportunity -- we think this market is by any reasonable test market where United has 62%, the nearest competitor has 9% but that is not a workably competitive market and that therefore the district judge oath to be asked to consider further forms of relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="7174.822" offset="28802696">You see, that binds up within it, one of the conflicts we have with the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="7180.195" offset="28824116">In our view, in our conception of what the Decree was, it clearly did not work as it was expected or at least hoped because we did not interpret the Decree and I think our brief in the Supreme Court when it was up on appeal makes this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="7196.123" offset="28887855">We did not interpret the Decree in the way that Judge Wyzanski now does.</text>
            <text syncTime="7201.750" offset="28910320">Now, it seems to me that at the least, we have every reason in light of paragraphs 18 and 23 of that original Decree to assume that if the Decree had substantially fail to eradicate monopoly power we would be able to get some further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7223.955" offset="28999241">At the very least, there has been no bad faith on the part of the government or no failure to take an appeal that should have taken as I indicated earlier.</text>
