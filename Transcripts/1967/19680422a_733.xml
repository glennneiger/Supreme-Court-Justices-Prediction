            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 733, Perma Life Mufflers, Incorporated, et.al., versus International Parts Corporation, et.al.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.979" offset="247306">Mr. Rolnick.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert F. Rolnick</label>
            <text syncTime="46.272" offset="288475">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.175" offset="316061">This is a treble damage action under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.383" offset="356916">The District Court dismissed the complaint holding that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue in as much as it said they were in pari delicto with the defendants who were the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.118" offset="463809">The Court of Appeals for the United States, the Seventh -- the Court of Appeals, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the cases here on a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.287" offset="520547">And the primary issue raised by the writ is whether a franchisee, who accepts a franchise agreement which is prepared and offered and whose terms are written by a franchisor is barred from bringing an action under Section 4 of the Clayton Act for injuries which the franchisee has sustained as a result of antitrust restraints which the franchisor has written into the franchise agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.534" offset="741543">The Court of Appeals, as I said, held that the mere entering into of this franchise agreement placed the antitrust plaintiffs in pari delicto with the defendants and barred plaintiffs from bringing the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.878" offset="842898">We submit that in making this ruling, both the Court of Appeals and the District Court committed plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.067" offset="883649">We submit that in pari delicto is not applicable to the factual context of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.285" offset="932551">And that if it were in pari delicto, it is not a defense to a claim under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.685" offset="970062">In order to understand the litigation, it's obviously necessary to detail the facts in some degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.811" offset="1006634">The defendants or the respondents here represent a complex of corporations, a parent subsidiary and affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.980" offset="1051251">The parent corporation was organized in 1938 and was engaged from 1938 until 1955 primarily in the wholesale manufacture and or distribution of automotive exhaust system equipment for the replacement market.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.646" offset="1153964">In 1955, when the acts which give rise to this litigation occurred, the parent and its subsidiaries, business volume exceeded $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.174" offset="1224077">They were a very substantial factor in the market at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.232" offset="1260335">In order to expand the nature of their business however, they decided to initiate a franchise program.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.853" offset="1306833">To the end of initiating this program, they originated the name Midas which they proceeded to use in trademark in March of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.349" offset="1364720">Thereafter, they developed a franchise concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.895" offset="1386977">The franchise concept was built around a brand identification for the defendantâ€™s muffler using the name Midas.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.635" offset="1441938">A unique lifetime guarantee for that muffler under which the parent company stood behind its muffler and advised the public through a massive advertising campaign on a national basis that the muffler was good for the life of the car if it blew out or rusted out for some reason during the life of the car -- during the life that you owned the car that they would replace the muffler free of charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.865" offset="1578820">In their advertising, the franchise were featured, this lifetime guarantee rapid free 15-minute installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.468" offset="1625213">Indeed, it was the first time in the history of a replacement part product for an automobile that a consumer campaign had put on -- had been put on to develop a demand for this particular product.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.223" offset="1696266">Having created the concept, the parent company then proceeded to organize a wholly owned subsidiary by the name of Midas, Inc. in 19 -- late 1955 and then went about the job of finding franchisees.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.356" offset="1768782">Principally, in this litigation there are four petitioners, all of whom were franchisees.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.488" offset="1801279">Three of these franchisees originally were customers of the parent corporation International Parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.260" offset="1848404">The fourth franchisee became aware of the franchise program through an advertisement to which he responded.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.048" offset="1903574">One of the -- all four accepted franchises.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.206" offset="1928234">One of the franchisees accepted the franchise only after he was advised that unless he did he would be subjected to competition from anyone that the parent company would franchise in that area and also with the threat that the parent company would discontinue selling it's international brand muffler, which that franchisee had carried in its place of business prior to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.866" offset="2074833">Now, the franchises which these petitioners accepted contained in their expressed terms provisions which required the franchisee to maintain the price which the franchise owner established.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.224" offset="2156231">There was a provision in this franchise agreement which also required the franchiser or the franchisee -- excuse me, to purchase exclusively from the franchisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.260" offset="2212446">In other words, the franchisee was to handle no other muffler but the respondents' Midas Muffler and indeed he was not to purchase any exhaust system parts from anyone other than the franchisee -- the franchisor and this included such exhaust system parts, its tail pipes, exhaust pipes, clamps and a whole host of other items which were essential in the installation of an automotive exhaust system.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.184" offset="2348074">These items aside from the muffler were not trademarked.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.713" offset="2378271">Now soon after the franchisees has accepted their agreements --</text>
