            <text syncTime="12.151" offset="152012">Mr. Chief Justice, yesterday afternoon, we were discussing the constitutional implications of the opened concession of Mississippi that the statute here under consideration has been selectively enforced in the area of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.573" offset="233618">Here, Mississippi has openly acknowledged that if a parade which completely obstructs a street has general community approval, the statute will not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.020" offset="307493">But if it has a different purpose, perhaps one in sharp opposition to what this Court has called in Button, the opinions of the politically dominant White community, the statute will be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.753" offset="454405">Yes, open complete concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.036" offset="467466">Now, what Mississippi attempts to do here is precisely what Louisiana attempted to do before this Court in Cox and that is the effort to say that a parade is not a mass demonstration but as this Court there pointed out, a parade as the dictionary itself had -- a mass demonstration as the dictionary itself points out is a public manifestation of feeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.439" offset="601109">Now, if this public manifestation of feeling expresses safe, dominant community views, then it's permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.076" offset="647711">If it expresses unpopular views such as opposition to the dominant majorities, disenfranchisement of Negroes, then it is semantically a mass demonstration prohibited by the statute, but this is precisely what this Court time and time again has said that the Constitution prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.949" offset="763173">And as we pointed out yesterday, there has been striking unanimity in this Court on the vice of discriminatory enforcement because as Mr. Justice Black said in his concurring opinion in Cox that discriminatory enforcement represents censorship in its most odious form unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.119" offset="971839">Was there any statement comparable to the statement on page 74 of your brief with respect to the blocking of access to courthouses?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.190" offset="1024084">It's the first part of the statute here under which these people are prosecuted relates to blocking courthouses and public buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.628" offset="1065880">The second part of it relates to free use of the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.316" offset="1088658">The -- what you have referred to as a concession as it appears on page 74 as I read it relates only to blocking the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.130" offset="1135888">Now, is there anything like that with respect to blocking access to public buildings or courthouses?</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Kinoy</label>
            <text syncTime="264.511" offset="1161383">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.166" offset="1163995">On page 236 of the transcript on the examination of Mr. Dukes and solicitor in respect to the homecoming parade for Mississippi Southern, the question was asked, “Did the parade pass in front of the courthouse?”</text>
            <text syncTime="281.001" offset="1227421">It did.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.108" offset="1235780">The question, “was it during daylight hours?”</text>
            <text syncTime="285.146" offset="1243930">Answer, “During the daylight hours.”</text>
            <text syncTime="287.912" offset="1255006">Question, “When the courthouse was normally open for business?”</text>
            <text syncTime="290.844" offset="1266709">A, “normally open for business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="293.009" offset="1275382">Question, “Did it keep people from being able to cross the street from the Sears Roebuck to the courthouse?</text>
            <text syncTime="299.402" offset="1300982">Answer, “It did,” so that there is equal concession, Mr. Justice Fortas, in respect to blocking the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.690" offset="1342151">Now, I suggest to the Court that the only possible conclusion from these open record concessions is that concededly Mississippi is not engaging in the evenhanded enforcement of the statute which the utterly majority of this Court required as a constitutional minimal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.387" offset="1468897">And that if federal judicial protection is not available where admittedly there is no evenhanded enforcement of a state statute, then I suggest to the Court the somber warning of the dissent in utterly must be carefully reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.772" offset="1566490">This is one of the most classic examples which a transcript has ever brought before this Court of planned prosecutorial misuse of a statute regulating freedom of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.326" offset="1628662">This is one of the two types of challenges to a state criminal statute which Mr. Justice White pointed out in his dissenting opinion in the original Cameron case warrants extraordinary federal intervention in a state criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.169" offset="1708074">Now, I would suggest to the Court that this pattern of selective enforcement raises a second consideration which emerged sharply at the remand hearing which likewise invokes the criteria of Dombrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.864" offset="1786859">Now, this Court has taught us in a numerable opinion that the danger of selective enforcement often flows from statutes overly broad or vague in the area of the First Amendment such a statute is now clearly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.259" offset="1880377">At the remand hearing, the appellees introduced an amended statute and it's there exhibit at 104 of the appendix House Bill 114 which is now before this Court for consideration for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.396" offset="1968985">This is a wholly different statute now than the statute which was before the Court on the original Cameron consideration and the difference is dramatically summarized in the new title of the statute which is an act to prohibit unreasonable interference with free ingress to and from any public buildings, premises, courthouses, public streets and sidewalks, and the word as the Court will notice unreasonably is now inserted into the text of the statute so that it prohibits picketing or mass demonstrations which unreasonably obstruct or interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.386" offset="2184965">Now, I would like to point out to the Court that while this statute was approved on July 9, 1964 by a legislature, it was not called to the attention of the original three-judge court or to the appellants or to this Court on the original review so that the opinions dissenting in Cameron of both Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice White deal only with the original text of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.208" offset="2324250">Only on the remand hearing was the amended statute called to the attention of the three-judge court and the appellants, plaintiff below, and --</text>

            <text syncTime="1478.807" offset="6018591">In other words, the law itself was designed to cut off peaceful, protected activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.721" offset="6126216">But what the transcript below shows, Mr. Justice Stewart, is what this Court pointed out in Button was so important in considering the operation of a statute, its setting and the way it operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.208" offset="6192253">Let me make this suggestion, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.038" offset="6207509">I would suggest that it's rather amazing that the majority below and the appellees do not discuss the arrests which took place on the afternoon of April 10 and the morning of April 11 and the morning of May 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.067" offset="6303640">They simply do not discuss them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.624" offset="6309909">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.798" offset="6314611">Because these arrests were of seven people, seven people with not a single bit of evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.473" offset="6365288">They didn't even attempt to show obstruction of anything whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.018" offset="6387440">And as Judge Rives points out below, he uses the word “fantastic”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.952" offset="6415130">He says it's incredibly fantastic to believe that the arrests of seven people carrying signs saying “Mississippians are Americans, too” and “We demand the right to vote” could conceivably be the violation of any state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.070" offset="6495692">Now, we suggest that this is highly significant because this shows the way in which the Mississippi authorities utilized the statute, assuming Mr. Justice Stewart, which we do not because the Court is aware of our position of challenging the facial unconstitutionality of the statute, both originally and as amended, particularly as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.484" offset="6601331">But assuming a valid statute here, under the second branch of Dombrowkski, I would suggest that nothing is clearer as Judge Rives points out a pattern of utilization of a conceivably valid state statute to harass the exercise of Civil rights and First Amendment activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.654" offset="6953984">Now, what we would suggest is that the record shows in light now that Mississippi has in fact interpreted the statute as if it had an overbroad sweep bringing into its orbit protected First Amendment and civil rights activities, that the full criteria of Dombrowski under both the first branch and the second branch are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.379" offset="7104867">The only point I would like to make to the Court in conclusion is that what is most serious here is the final suggestion of the majority below that federal relief should be denied because picketing in Mississippi to obtain a vote and to encourage others to do so is a thing of the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.962" offset="7207267">And I would suggest to the Court that as the coroner commission report pointed out just two days ago, country stands at a crossroads, that at this moment in Mississippi and throughout the nation, a strengthening of federal power to protect the peaceful utilization of First Amendment liberties in the solution of fundamental problems which rift this nation is the highest duty and obligation of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.200" offset="7360136">That to deny relief today in this case would be to advocate the higher responsibility of the federal national judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.381" offset="7520946">I regret that Mr. Smith yesterday in all most of the beginning of his argument saw fit to go outside the record and take a verbal salvo at the south and Mississippi particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.794" offset="7630555">He said to this Court conditions are still bad in the south and particularly in Mississippi and we need every vehicle to protect people's federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.998" offset="7691368">He added just last night that there was a shooting in Mississippi at Mr. Charles' evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.236" offset="7724283">That statement, if the Court please, was unwarranted and untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.736" offset="7766288">I would be less than frank and honest with this Court if I did not say, and I'm not at all proud of it that in the past, Mississippi has been grossly discriminate or discriminatory particularly in the field of registering and voting rights for Negroes, and I say I'm not proud of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.304" offset="7896586">But I can say to this Court that within the past or for the past two years at least, we've done a lot to get our house in order and we need and I think now deserve all the help we can get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.323" offset="8000658">I've been an Assistant Attorney General of Mississippi since June of '62 and for the last three years, I've been more or less the liaison between the Attorney General's office, the Governor's Office, and the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.017" offset="8067427">Since the fall of 1965, there has been no problem whatsoever in Negroes registering and voting in Mississippi, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.790" offset="8122493">Over 200,000 of them are registered there to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.972" offset="8147257">In last summer's general primary -- I mean primary and general elections, more than 75 Negroes were candidates for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.197" offset="8184142">Between 25 and 30 of them were elected, elected to members of board to supervisors, justices of the peace, constable, clerks to the chancery court, members of school boards, one elected to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.358" offset="8260838">Just last month in a special election to fill the unexpired term of Governor Williams as congressman, there were certain candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.483" offset="8297305">Candidates in the race, one was Charles Edwards, a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.850" offset="8310784">He led the ticket and he's in the runoff in the second primary for the next Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.121" offset="8347878">I know what the situation is there with reference to voting and registering, and there is no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.518" offset="8373478">In all of the elections last summer, and I worked -- I have pushed all knowledge of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.745" offset="8394376">I worked with the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.911" offset="8403048">Those elections were observed by federal observers, members of the Justice Department and there was no criticism of any of them, no charges of unfairness in any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.547" offset="8449546">So I say we've gone a long ways to get our house in order and we need all the help and encouragement we can get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.952" offset="8495208">Now, to put this case in perspective, if the Court would please, and I don't know whether Mr. Kinoy sought to confuse everybody but he certainly did me about some of the issues in this matter.</text>
