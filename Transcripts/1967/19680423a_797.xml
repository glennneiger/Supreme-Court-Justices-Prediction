            <text syncTime="44.522" offset="281475">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.258" offset="300387">In this case, the Pennsylvania Railroad, now the Penn Central Transportation Company and other railroads sought to cut their rate on ingot molds which are iron forms in which molten steel is cast from $11.86 per ton to $5.11 per ton to capture traffic that had moved for a decade by combination barge and truck service.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.344" offset="428701">The Commission found that the new railroad rate would impair an inherent cost advantage of the barge-truck mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.483" offset="465272">The Commission ordered the railroads to cancel the offending rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.581" offset="485648">The District Court of three judges reversed the Commission's decision and the Commission is here today on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.673" offset="518040">This is the first rate case to reach the courts involving the standards governing the fair competition between regulated carriers of different modes of transportation since this Court's decision in the New Haven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.016" offset="575404">Interstate Commerce Commission versus New York, New Haven and Hartford decided in 1963 reported in 372 of the United States Reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.425" offset="617096">The New Haven case was the first in which this Court addressed itself to the role of the Commission in overseeing rate competition among different modes of transportation following the 1958 Amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.051" offset="687626">Like the New Haven case, the present case involves the meaning of the 1958 Amendment to Section 15 (a) (3) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.120" offset="743842">The Amendment added this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.110" offset="759829">Rates of a carrier shall not be held up to a particular level to protect the traffic of any other mode of transportation giving due consideration to the objectives of the National Transportation policy declared in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.688" offset="830151">And the particular objective of the transportation policy that is here in issue again like New Haven is the recognition and preservation of inherent cost advantages as between competing modes of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.863" offset="898800">When the present case was before the Commission, the railroads and the barge lines followed strictly the format described in the New Haven case for presenting the issue of which mode possesses an inherent cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.969" offset="971212">The railroads first showed that their newly reduced rate of $5.11 would more than cover their long-term out of pocket costs of $4.69 and hence the reduced rate was just unreasonable from the standpoint of railroad revenue requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.799" offset="1058565">They then showed their full cost of carrying this traffic to be $7.59 that is the out of pocket cost of $4.69 plus a share of the constant expenses of running the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.798" offset="1134529">The barge-truck mode then claimed an inherent cost advantage and brought forth data relating to its own cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.370" offset="1168802">The barge-truck mode showed that the railroads were reducing their rate below the barge-truck full cost of $5.19 and they are on a full cost basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.045" offset="1219584">The barge-truck mode possessed an inherent cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.645" offset="1237974">The railroads countered by saying that no cost comparison should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.592" offset="1265768">They then said that if one is to be made, the costs on the barge side should include the governmental cost of improving the water rights of way or the Commission should ignore on the rail side of the equation, all rail constant costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.980" offset="1339329">The Commission held it would not follow either of the railroads suggestions.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.411" offset="1361063">Determination of inherent cost advantage requires a cost comparison.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.987" offset="1439326">Citing a proceeding in which it had given more detailed consideration to the question of what costs are relevant to a comparison between railroads and barge lines, the Commission held that it would adhere to a comparison of full costs of the two competing modes and down the basis -- on the basis of such a comparison here the rail rate impaired the barge lines low cost advantage and should be cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.970" offset="1551235">When the case came before the lower court, the lower court held agreeing with the railroads that no comparison of rates was necessary or proper as a matter of law since the railroad rate of $5.11 more than covered the rail out of pocket costs of $4.69.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.010" offset="1639424">The Court held that as a matter or law, the Commission was powerless to order the railroad rate cancelled.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.670" offset="1854046">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.642" offset="1873899">The lower court cites the issue of what costs are relevant to comparing cost of different modes and of measuring inherent cost advantages of different modes.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.648" offset="1933981">The opinion below contradicted the plain meaning of the statute in relying upon what was profitable for the proponent of the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.971" offset="1979225">Section 15 (a) (3) requires the Commission to give due consideration to the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.018" offset="2007437">The policy in turn requires the Commission to recognize and preserve inherent advantages of each mode subject to its regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.398" offset="2040978">Besides this due consideration required on the face of Section 15 (a) (3), the final sentence of the National Transportation Policy itself requires the Commission to administer the entire act in accordance to the requirements of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.820" offset="2110673">As this Court stated in the Schaffer Transportation case decided in 1957, the policy provides a yard stick by which the correctness of the Commission's action will be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.857" offset="2158843">The Commission could not properly end its inquiry as the lower court required us to do with the finding that the rate would benefit the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.688" offset="2206072">The lower court's decision that the Commission was required to end its inquiry with the finding that the rate would benefit the railroads was contrary to the decision of this Court in the New Haven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.884" offset="2250898">This Court specifically stated that the Commission's task does not end upon finding that a reduced rate will benefit the proponent of the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.736" offset="2294366">As this Court stated in the New Haven case, the precise example given to the Senate Committee which led to the language adopted in 1958 was a case in which the railroads by establishing a compensatory rate forced a smaller competing lower cost mode to go below its own fully distributed cost and thus perhaps to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.790" offset="2398542">This Court stated that the principal purpose of the reference to the National Transportation Policy that was contained in Section 15 (a) (3) was to emphasize the Commission's power to prevent the railroads from setting a rate which would impair or destroy the inherent advantages of competing modes of transportation and the precise example given by this Court of how this impairment might occur in the normal case was by the railroads forcing a competing mode with a cost advantage on particular transportation to establish a non-profitable rate in order to attract traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.406" offset="2752972">This was not reached in New Haven but the lower court has created a rule of law that you look only to the profitability of this rate to the proponent of the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.304" offset="2804590">Now, that question we submit was reached in New Haven and this Court held in New Haven that you do not look only to the profitability of the rate to the proponent but the Commission has a further task.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.380" offset="2872926">Now, the appellees in the lower court rely heavily on the Commission's 1945 decisions in the New Automobiles case.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.380" offset="2904900">Of course this Court in New Haven referred to New Automobiles as a case whose result was particularly favored by Congress in 1958 but appellees in the lower court received no comfort to the New Automobiles decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.193" offset="2960175">New Automobiles was cited in Congress only for the proposition that rail rates should not be held up merely to make certain that all modes participate in the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.230" offset="3000299">This is the only principle of New Automobiles that Congress endorsed as this Court expressly stated in New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.673" offset="3026108">The New Automobiles was cited by Congress in opposition to the cases in which the Commission had held that in its judgment, certain rail reductions were lower than necessary to meet competition without reference to inherent cost advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.114" offset="3087862">And Congress in 1958 sought to give new emphasis to protecting these advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.066" offset="3115656">In looking only to the costs of the proponent of the rate to decide the lawfulness of the rate, the lower court gave to the railroads in this case what years of law being before Congress had failed to attain.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.094" offset="3183783">We suggest that the ruling below does not differ from two of the so-called three shall nots which Congress rejected in the 1950s and which this Court discussed in the New Haven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.645" offset="3233938">The railroads lobbied for years that the Commission and I quote, “Shall not consider the effect of such charge on the traffic of any other mode of transportation or the relation of such charge to the charge of any other mode of transportation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="799.676" offset="3302066">These were the first two of the three shall nots.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.436" offset="3317112">These shall nots died in committee only to be revived in the ruling of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.120" offset="3351803">The lower court sought to remove what it called a restriction on competition with its ruling and to free the railroads to operate that were beneficial to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.688" offset="3394121">The lower court improperly assumed, we submit, improperly assumed that Congress legislated in 1958 exclusively to further competition between the modes of transportation and to remove cost comparisons from rate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.043" offset="3467577">We submit such is not the case again as this Court stated in New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.984" offset="3487326">The principle reason for the reference back to the National Transportation Policy in Section 15 (a) (3) was to emphasize the Commission's power to prevent the railroads from impairing the inherent cost advantages of competing modes of transportation by rate cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.843" offset="3570709">In the New Haven case, the Department of Justice acknowledged that the Commission must compare costs and protect the carrier having the lower fully distributed costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.129" offset="3627865">In fact so strongly did the department believed that the inherent advantage of lower full costs must be protected from impairment that it would have imposed the differential favoring the barge lines that had lower full costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.035" offset="4063483">More strangely still is the department's current position contrary to the decision of this Court in New Haven that the Commission has no power either to recognize an inherent cost advantage on the level other than out of pocket cost or to stop the railroads from making unduly lower rates that impair another mode's cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.575" offset="4161703">The department in fact would ignore the Commission has been rate power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.462" offset="4177272">It would turn the clock back about 50 years when the Commission could only stop the railroads from again increasing an unduly low rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.031" offset="4239548">Consistent with the prior decisions, the Commission here found that a comparison of the full cost of each mode must be made to determine which mode has an inherent cost advantage and that it would exercise its minimum rate power to cancel a rate that impaired such an advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.051" offset="4331604">The Congress have the request of the Commission did not lay down any test of inherent cost advantage as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.682" offset="4370056">Significantly, the only time that Congress addressed itself to the question was to consider whether full costs should be adopted as a matter of law for every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.504" offset="4417390">In New Haven, this Court implied that a full cost comparison would be an appropriate measure of inherent cost advantages but it stated explicitly that the choice among different measures was one of utility and one for the Commission to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.734" offset="4498265">The inherent cost advantage that Congress primarily concerned itself with was no secret from the parties to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.081" offset="4535672">Senator Wheeler had stated in 1940 during the course of the legislative history of the Transportation Act of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.777" offset="4578513">When the -- and this I quote, “When the Bill speaks of inherent advantages of the shipping interest, it refers to carriers which can transport at a cheaper rate because they can ship by water by way of canals and the ocean so they have natural advantages and they do not have the expense of the upkeep of the rights of way as railroads do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.825" offset="4690631">It was this absence of right of way costs that Congress specially sought to preserve as a recognized cost advantage of water carriers and the railroad witnesses in the present case also recognize the barge lines cost advantage in relation to the railroads only to urge that the Commission should permit the railroads to defeat disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.975" offset="4783313">In their view, the Commission should either ignore rail constant costs altogether or increase barge line costs by the amount of the Government cost of improving the waterways and the railroads repeat on brief in this Court that only some of their right of way costs should enter into the comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.164" offset="4884041">Here, the Commission simply incorporated the discussion of this issue contained in the earlier Green case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.680" offset="4910059">Commission had their help that full cost has actually born by the water carriers and not hypothetical costs should be used to compare the cost of railroads and water carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.661" offset="4966066">The congressional policy has been to exempt inland water carriers from user charges and hence to exempt shippers by water from paying for the waterways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.191" offset="5004100">The Commission therefore refused to compare cost of operation as if the water carriers did in fact pay user charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.969" offset="5035238">It simply recognized and preserved the existing cost advantage of the water carriers and consistent with its ruling in the Green case.</text>
