            <text syncTime="47.984" offset="295267">I think that my argument will deal with that and if Your Honor does not feel so, I feel myself charged at some point to come back to your question.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="59.107" offset="339780">Well that’s Justice Douglas’ question yesterday which you said you were going to get to, I just wanted to remind you of it.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Harrington</label>
            <text syncTime="65.690" offset="366111">Well to continue Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the court as you will recall at the -- shortly before the afternoon recess of yesterday I had asserted that the position which I assert that the burden of proof of showing the voluntariness of a confession should be on the prosecution, was supported by Miranda v. Arizona and I say that primarily because I think it’s plain in Miranda and the Arizona that it is intended that the same procedural rules with respect to an involuntary confession applied in both state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.725" offset="582301">I say it is not, it is of significance though not of the same significance that the Miranda rules themselves were such that the burden of proving compliance was placed squarely on the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.053" offset="647607">I should also observe that in Miranda Mr. Justice Clark in his opinion where he dissented in three cases and concurred in one says this is at page 503 of the opinion and I think that I would best read this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.441" offset="717093">In the absence of warnings, the burden would be on the state to prove that the council was knowingly and intelligently waived or that in the totality of the circumstances including the failure to give the necessary warnings the confession was completely voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.801" offset="798595">Now I think it’s perfectly clear that even that standard was in no wise observed in the case at bar where there was custodial interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.996" offset="839346">There was clearly an absence of warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.153" offset="851989">The burden was not on the prosecution and indeed the voluntariness question was not considered in the light of the totality of the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.690" offset="950105">It has the aspect of the burden of proof in the voir dire that was held as a preliminary examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.132" offset="991901">It also has an aspect that I will come to in just a moment that in this particular case the jury never received a question of the voluntariness of the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.186" offset="1152084">This is the English rule, it is the rule in Ireland, it is the rule in the federal courts, it is the rule in most all of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.641" offset="1201925">There are seven which to our research have the burden on the whole issue of voluntariness placed as Massachusetts places it.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.420" offset="1273083">As I recall it -- I have read my dissent recently in the Deno case, one of my arguments was that this was a burden that rested on the state to show that the jury had to preside but the court projected that.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.973" offset="1379244">And your dissent contains the proposition for which I contend that the -- in this case where there was no explicit waiver that the jury should have passed on the question of voluntariness.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.682" offset="1470151">Number one, I gather your proposition is there must a voir dire determination of voluntariness at which the state has the burden of proving voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.108" offset="1519783">In other words, over the objection to the admission of the confession as I understand it, this creates the requirement of a voir dire.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="364.952" offset="1563146">And in that proceeding, the state must bare the burden of proving voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.317" offset="1584671">And if the court determines that yes, the confession was voluntarily given then you go a second step and say nevertheless the issue of voluntariness must begin to be submitted to the jury for ultimate determination, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="421.776" offset="1790516">I say that was the last point but I might as well come to it right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.113" offset="1827819">There are perhaps three aspects to this, one I assert that these constitutional rules with respect to voluntariness and the procedures with respect to voluntariness are such that they are retrospective in application.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.928" offset="1899081">Indeed in Johnson v New Jersey this court said that the defendants convicted prior to the date of Johnson v New Jersey had the benefit of the increasingly meticulous test of voluntaries made it -- and that Johnson v New Jersey quite plainly distinguished between the prospective application of the Miranda rules and the Escobedo rule and the test with respect to voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.228" offset="2020289">So I say that on this branch of my argument as to procedures, there should be retrospective application with respect to the branch of my argument that goes to the point that as a matter of law in these circumstances, the confession should begin to involuntary -- that involves no retrospectivity or prospectivity problem because those doctrines, when this court upon its own independent review has determined that a confession must be deemed to be involuntary that --</text>
