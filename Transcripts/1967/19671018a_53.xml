            <text syncTime="13.570" offset="157654">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.353" offset="168835">Petitioner, James Burgett seeks the indication of his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.993" offset="187329">He was convicted in a Texas State Court on a jury verdict of ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.685" offset="214079">He was -- had his conviction affirmed on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas and on his own motion obtained a writ of certiorari in your court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.381" offset="256920">He was indicted for assault with intent to murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.869" offset="274892">The charges against him were brought by a jailer in the town of Greenville, Texas where he was being held for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.355" offset="312822">At the time of his trial as his trial proceeded, his court appointed counsel in Greenville filed a motion to quash the indictment which alleged four prior convictions which the state used to invoke one of the habitual criminal statutes, the result of which would be life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.043" offset="403519">There was no state procedure available before trial to attack the prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.015" offset="431417">The motion to quash as set out in the statutes applied only to technical features of the indictment such as an illegally constituted grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.427" offset="477080">Nevertheless, the court appointed lawyer moved to quash, stating that he didn't have enough information to make any further attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.777" offset="526503">There was no action taken insofar as the record is concerned on his motion to quash but the counsel really couldn't expect the Court to take any motion since the Texas law was clear that the defendant was not entitled to have copies of the prior convictions that were going to be used against him and that the defendant was not entitled to object prior to trial to the use of any prior conviction, instead he had to make his objection in front of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.494" offset="645308">As the trial began, the state read the indictment and the jury was told that petitioner was duly and legally convicted on four prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.845" offset="690761">As the evidence came in, the state introduced into evidence one version, first of one of the Tennessee convictions alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.262" offset="736423">That conviction stated on its face that petitioner did not have counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.189" offset="800162">The conviction recited on his face that he had appeared in court without counsel and there was absolutely nothing in the record to indicate that counsel had been tendered to him or that he had waived counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.587" offset="849690">His court appointed lawyer objected on the ground that the conviction showed on its face that petitioner did not have counsel and that there was no indication of waiver which brought him squarely within Carnley against Cochran.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.198" offset="908204">Secondly, he raised the issue of course under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.082" offset="931715">The judge reserved ruling and the state offered the same conviction and evidence, this time, a different and inconsistent certified copy of the same conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.149" offset="976018">The second version did not have a recitation that counsel was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.393" offset="996916">It was simply silent on whether counsel was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.808" offset="1010604">Again, there was no language in the second certified copy of the same conviction to indicate that petitioner had been tendered counsel or that he had waived counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.485" offset="1053341">The Court then proceeded to receive evidence again without making a ruling and again over counsel's objections, proceeded to hear evidence concerning a Texas conviction for burglary, the preceding in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.146" offset="1120005">The judge after a hearing, partially in camara, ruled out the Texas conviction on the ground that it was void on state law grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.645" offset="1157935">He did not admit the first version of the Tennessee conviction that recited that petitioner was of -- without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.117" offset="1183848">He did admit into evidence the second inconsistent version of the Tennessee conviction stating -- overruling defendant's objections, the trial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.018" offset="1235466">There was nothing else in the record to indicate what happened until the Court's charge in which the Court charged the jury that they had heard certain evidence that tended to show that the defendant had been guilty of previous crimes and that they were not to consider that for any purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.009" offset="1711417">He was indicted early in April of 1965 on this habitual criminal charge to be tried later that month.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.967" offset="1751228">As evidence, I as the District Attorney have four alleged prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.625" offset="1781844">Now, only two are required under the Texas Act but I decided to use four prior convictions which I am permitted to do by the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.513" offset="1829386">I look at this convictions and I see that at least one Tennessee conviction that I'm going to offer in evidence is inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.697" offset="1874108">I have their -- I do not know and cannot tell which is the true certified copy of the Tennessee conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.363" offset="1904828">But this I can see that on the certified copy of the conviction that I'm going to offer in evidence it affirmatively states that petitioner was without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.536" offset="1949550">And also, there is nothing in any of the convictions or any of the papers certified under Civil Secretary of State of Tennessee or of the clerk to indicate that petitioner was offered counsel or that he waived his right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.576" offset="2213700">The jury is never told that petitioner was never validly convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.390" offset="2232926">They're simply instructed at that late date not at the time the evidence was offered but at the time of the charge not to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.819" offset="2278693">I don't see how any lawyer reading Carnley against Cochran and Gideon against Wainwright, could reach the conclusion that those convictions could -- were valid and could be used in evidence against petitioner or could be used to invoke the Habitual Criminal Act of the State of Texas.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Gooch</label>
            <text syncTime="2985.743" offset="12046294">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.874" offset="12050892">I have to make several points in a short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.880" offset="12066879">First, I'd like to say is that Mr. Douglas I believe gave you the order backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.018" offset="12087463">The Tennessee convictions were offered first and the judge did not preclude any evidence coming in on the Tennessee convictions that were offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.149" offset="12123930">The judge specifically said that he would reserve his rulings until the District Attorney offered all evidence that he was going to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.957" offset="12155173">And when the district attorney -- this is on page 36 to 41 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.079" offset="12175653">Secondly, obviously then the state was not prevented from making any proof they cared to make in connection with the Tennessee conviction that was admitted in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.818" offset="12226644">Third, I don't see how they conceivably could make this a life sentence case not only with these convictions but also in the brief they argued because the jury knew that the defendant was in jail, that the jury could take that evidence into consideration and impose a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.927" offset="12295084">The plain truth is he wasn't even convicted at the time that he was held in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.837" offset="12314728">Next, the offer to stipulate the choice that the defendant has to make is -- make these constitutional objections in front of the jury suffer the prejudice are stipulated outside the presence of the jury when the state has the right to require the defendant to put on any evidence that he has about punishment outside the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.207" offset="12400201">But the defendant doesn't have that right, only the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.815" offset="12418591">We only ask that the odds be evened a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.232" offset="12432280">Secondly, the motion to quash the indictment does not go to striking prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.862" offset="12458820">It's simply to the form and substance, the content and it does not cover this point in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.810" offset="12482644">It does not cover those points in the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.078" offset="12495705">Next, there was an objection to the Dallas conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.287" offset="12516498">What they offered first was the Dallas indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.019" offset="12535411">The Dallas conviction was objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.607" offset="12549831">Next, this can happen again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.877" offset="12562892">This can happen again for the simple reason that even with the two state's trial, the state can still under the present law use these void convictions during the punishment phase of the trial, unless the defendant has some way in advance to prevent them from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.447" offset="12633109">After guilt has been determined and you begin the punishment phase, the indictment is read to the jury and we're right back where we started.</text>
