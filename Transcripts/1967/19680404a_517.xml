            <label>Mr. Russell J. Schonekas</label>
            <text syncTime="24.995" offset="203316">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.757" offset="210422">This case unlike the two prior ones I don't think is nearly is complicated presents very simple issues were obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.606" offset="241768">I say they're simple because they are singular and simple it's just a question in -- the Louisiana Supreme Court has absolutely refused to follow the instructions and law as laid down by this Court and that by some in substance of the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.302" offset="308537">Mr. Phil St. Amant was a qualified candidate for the Senate -- for the State of Louisiana and during his campaign he made certain statements against one Herman A. Thompson who was then a police sheriff's captain for one of the parishes, that is the parish of East Baton Rouge unlike -- most every other state we have parishes as apposed to counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.475" offset="425253">We're different again in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.225" offset="432253">We're always different.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.989" offset="439359">Now, we again this particular parish did not have police officers, they have what they call a sheriff's force.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.946" offset="467153">A sheriff with other deputies who will work directly under him and his official functions as a sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.350" offset="496724">This plaintiff -- respondent here, Herman A. Thompson was a deputy sheriff enjoined the position of captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.177" offset="532041">Mr. St. Amant in his campaign and over a -- with a radio address which was also distributed claimed that Mr. Thompson had been received from the other party to -- change of hands of money between themselves and another individual whom he claimed was very nefarious character, Mr. Ed Partin who was a union official with quite a background and who they claimed were very close friends and Mr. Partin had been there and Mr. Thompson had been to Mr. Partin's office and there had been a change of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.987" offset="671326">Immediately thereafter, Mr. Thompson, Captain Thompson instituted a liable and slander sued in the State Court of Louisiana under what we referred to as Article 2315, that is the tort law for the State of Louisiana which says that every action of man that causes damage to another he, by whose fault this shall be the case, must repair to damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.370" offset="776861">In this damage of liable sued against him, the defense was raised, number one, that there was -- it was to -- not malice, it was not -- was not liable, was not slander etcetera and further in the alternative that if it were that these statements were true that money had exchanged stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.316" offset="856586">The case was tried in the lower court, a judgment was rendered against Mr. St. Amant alleging that the statements were liable and slanderous implying malice to him by virtue of these actions that he have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.821" offset="918653">This Court had handed down the Time-Sullivan -- Times case and based on that decision waiving it a new trial was applied for the district level, the judge should consider the decision of the Times case and ruled that it was not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.543" offset="993573">He did however hold that Captains -- Thompson was a public official as had been defined in the various cases prior that time but not under the federal theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.656" offset="1046026">He said that under the laws of Louisiana, Captain Thompson was a public official and that he was a deputy sheriff for the captain level.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.638" offset="1085942">But on the rehearing, we consider the Times case, he refused to apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.996" offset="1107362">The case then went to our Court of Appeals, the First Circuit at which time the Court of Appeals specifically applied the doctrine and said that the aegis of the Times case did apply, there was no malice, it could not be imputed, they overruled the decision of the lower court and dismissed plaintiff suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.844" offset="1190745">Rich will apply to it for the normal rehearing to Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.554" offset="1217599">In the Louisiana Supreme Court, the case was again argued and the Court held that while it did apply again as to the lower court, the District Court and the Court of Appeals that Thompson was a public official under the Times case.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.651" offset="1281964">Still that he had not done taking certain action that were required, he to -- they thought to wipe away this threat of malice and therefore we say implied malice again was applied which cannot be done under the decisions that Your Honors have recently written along that line particularly like with Garrison, the Butts case, the Walker case and the Sullivan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.368" offset="1372871">But nevertheless they did in a 4:3 opinion with the strong dissent by Justice McKellop (ph), the -- we applied for the rehearing subsequently in writ which we are granted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.489" offset="1417279">The only problem, the only issues that are raised that I see that came here is number one, was this deputy sheriff a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.441" offset="1449148">But Your Honors we're very careful to point out in the Times case, you didn't say definitely how far down the line you would go to determine when is a man a public official or a public person as the other line of cases differentiate from public official.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.141" offset="1519888">I guess perhaps I don't read your Supreme Court opinion correctly, I thought the holding here was that yes he's a public official within the New York Times rule and therefore was a burden to show malice in the sense of knowing forcefully or reckless disregard that while there was no showing of knowing falsely there was sufficient evidence to show reckless disregard, am I wrong about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.219" offset="4180198">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.088" offset="4191692">I represent Mr. Thompson and I represented Mr. Thompson's inception of this lawsuit and I would like to briefly state a few of the facts that led up to this litigation and have been little -- I wont say misstated but not properly stated to show that proper perspective under which in the circumstances under which this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.026" offset="4279463">Mr. Phil A. St. Amant was a retired lieutenant colonel from the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.258" offset="4292420">He qualified for the office of the United State Senator running against the incumbent Russell B. Long in 1962 prior to June 27, 1962 he prepared a television film and on this film he had certain people appear to make statements among which was one Mr. J.D. Alban (ph), one who had a known criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.436" offset="4397119">Now, upon being and he showed this at a pre-television show at the capital house in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to the news people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.405" offset="4441004">The news -- the television station being aware of this, spoke to their counsel, they advised Mr. St. Amant to the effect that they -- while they had to give him equal time as a candidate for public office on the television station that they could not permit him to let these people appear Mr. Alban who was not a candidate nor would -- could they run the risk of being liable for what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.956" offset="4539225">Under Louisiana statute, there's a specific statute that exempts radio and television station from any liable or deformation actions for anything, any political candidate says because he have to give him equal time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.763" offset="4590425">So, ruling this out, he then had Mr. Alban prepare an affidavit for the television station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.645" offset="4621981">So then instead of Mr. Alban appearing on the program himself Mr. St. Amant takes his -- this affidavit and he reads what Mr. Alban says in a question and answer forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.909" offset="4670986">Now, in this question and answer forum, he starts off with this, I have story to reveal tonight which is so unusual that I have both -- this time on a television to inform the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.679" offset="4730128">This story involves a well documented criminal, an ex-convict who became a labor chief, referring to Mr. Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.432" offset="4761057">It involves misuse and theft of union funds, dealings with communist official in Cuba, a criminal conspiracy to destroy evidence and destruction of that evidence, death resulting from a commission of a felony and second death by hit and run by a union car, again, referring to Mr. Partin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.937" offset="4839111">Then he goes on to infer that Captain Herman Thompson who was on this East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office which is the same as a county sheriff's office, we do have police departments, had received funds and they didn't know what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.289" offset="4896580">They want to predicament.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.994" offset="4903372">Well, now, the evidence clearly show that Captain Hersman Thompson in helping the sheriff's office to carry out certain charitable events did participate in solicitation of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.386" offset="4948929">All of the unions in the parish -- of these Baton Rouge contributed the -- namely, the kid's baseball clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.322" offset="4968678">The annual salvation (Inaudible) five roses and one of Captain Herman Thompson's duties as -- in-charge of the uniform division is to see that the deputies go around and pick up these funds and deliver them and he went to these teamster's hall and again he knew Mr. Partin, he had to know, I mean his business but they were not close personal friends as they refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.373" offset="5064913">They did not socialize together anything else he knew him personally through a business connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.965" offset="5087274">He went there, they gave him these -- whatever funds the union had to contribute, he delivered them to the Sheriff's secretary, Mrs. Pauline Cox and that testimony is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.887" offset="5126875">Now, Captain Herman Thompson nor the Sheriff's office was in no way related to -- in the -- to this political campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.386" offset="5160939">Political campaign was between Senator Russell B. Long and Mr. Phil A. St. Amant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.479" offset="5185285">So, he just opens up where the scout is shot in his speech and he defames these all kind of people, not only Captain Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.341" offset="5216737">Now, on the trial of the case, I filed a suit and I alleged that they were maliciously made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.116" offset="5243800">The case was tried in March of 1960 -- May of 1964, the New York Times case came out March of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.138" offset="5271907">Now, at that time when Mr. Golden Mills was Mr. St. Amant's attorney and he got rid of him and Mr. Jack Rogers took over him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.881" offset="5302941">Then between the original decision in the application for a new trial, a Mr. Richard G. Van Buskirk (ph) took over him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.673" offset="5334079">And at no time was any defense raised except that of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.946" offset="5355186">They did file an application for a new trial, a motion for truth -- new trial just arguing that it was contrary to the law in evidence then by way of brief, the New York Times case was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.044" offset="5403564">I object to the fifth time that Mr. Thompson was not a public official because under the further elaboration in the Rosenblatt case he did not fall in that definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.712" offset="7494196">But here's a man who's a captain on the sheriff's force, how is he going to buy equal time where he'd be heard equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.143" offset="7519901">Would his voice be as strong?</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.274" offset="7528469">And you commented on this in the Curtis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.798" offset="7538604">And I say it differentiates all together that if something else besides with what's a malice, I don't think there's any question with the trial judge who watched this man on the stand, saw his demeanor, the manner in which he testified was amply correct and the fact that this man had a complete utter disregard of Captain Thompson's reputation of how it affected him all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.641" offset="7629928">And I submit that the trial judge was correct on finding malice and I submit that all three courts were wrong in holding a public official made them for personal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.345" offset="7672769">I cannot say where it fits in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.102" offset="7683741">The New York Times, Rosenblatt, Curtis, Walker case but I submit that they were -- that the case has been -- the rules have been considered, they have been applied and the facts have been amply considered and malice found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.669" offset="7742046">Thank you.</text>
