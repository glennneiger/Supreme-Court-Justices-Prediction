            <text syncTime="23.726" offset="198301">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.960" offset="219199">This case comes to you on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit which affirmed an order of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, allowing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by Donald M. Painten, the respondent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.153" offset="295999">The respondent had been convicted in Massachusetts for armed robbery and other related charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.817" offset="318673">The Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth affirmed that a writ of error was subsequently denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.542" offset="345527">The United States District Court vacated the judgment of conviction and gave the Commonwealth the option either of bringing a new trial or discharging the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.023" offset="395473">The issue in this Court is essentially that of the reasonableness of police conduct held by the federal courts to be in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.214" offset="448240">Since the facts and the constitutional issues thereby presented are inseparably interwoven and I shall be obliged to state the facts in considerable detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.334" offset="496724">And at this point, may it please the Court, it is important to have in view that the statement of the facts that I shall be giving you is based in its entirety on the findings of the District Court which begin on page 50 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.989" offset="567359">There are certain discrepancies in the fact as they appear in those findings, as they appear in the testimony before the District Court in the evidentiary hearing and as they appear in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.330" offset="624724">These discrepancies are accounted for by the fact that the District Court and only the District Court had available to it, the full transcript of proceedings in the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.866" offset="1794800">They found themselves traveling behind a Ford Sedan occupied by two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.269" offset="1816430">They observed the Sedan pull up in front of a liquor store.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.473" offset="1829282">It happened that there had been a recent rash of liquor store hold ups in the vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.507" offset="1853419">Officer McNamara saw one of the two men get out of the car and entered the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.644" offset="1877974">He recognized the man as the respondent Painten from a mug shot, photograph of him that he picked at the police headquarters and happened to have in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.622" offset="1917889">The Sedan moved slowly up the street, turned around and pulled up before the liquor store.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.319" offset="1940668">When the driver saw McNamara in the unmarked police car, he took off down the street in a burst of speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.843" offset="1974732">McNamara wheeled the squad car around and gave a chase, overtaking the Sedan within a few blocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.926" offset="2003048">McNamara recognized the driver as one George Ash, whom he knew as having been convicted of several holdups in the past and thus having served time in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.424" offset="2049024">McNamara ordered Ash out of the car and asked him why he had fled.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.331" offset="2072743">Ash said that it was because McNamara had scared him.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.871" offset="2090820">The officers looked in the car and after some conversation, let Ash go on his way.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.359" offset="2112763">Ash went back in the direction of the liquor store.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.659" offset="2126033">In addition to the recent liquor store hold ups, there had been a loan company hold up that same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.867" offset="2150797">The hold up had been described as two White men, one tall, one a little shorter.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.283" offset="2176502">The appearance of Painten and Ash was consistent with this description, scanty though it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.607" offset="2201788">McNamara and Maxwell returned to the liquor store and showed Painten's picture to the clerk who told them that Painten lived in nearby apartment building.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.761" offset="2242435">They drove to this address and behind the building found the car that Ash had been driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.191" offset="2268139">Painten's name was under one of the door bells at the front door.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.538" offset="2285484">McNamara returned to his car and put in a radio call for two more police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.408" offset="2312965">When these two officers, Menia and Rufo arrived, McNamara told them that he and Maxwell were going up to see some fellows in an apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.887" offset="2354970">Rufo was assigned to watch the rear of the apartment building and Menia was left to watch the front stairway.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.798" offset="2386526">McNamara and Maxwell then went on upstairs to Painten's third floor apartment and knocked on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.239" offset="2416306">Painten came to the door, opened it only a few inches and asked who is there?</text>

            <text syncTime="600.324" offset="2504704">While the door was closed, McNamara heard inside the apartment, a sound like that of a window being raised and lowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.164" offset="2540022">A few seconds later Painten opened the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.942" offset="2551097">McNamara and Maxwell entered the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.909" offset="2563009">Inside in the kitchen, they found George Ash and a woman identified as Doris Painten.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.182" offset="2644093">About three minutes had elapsed between the admission of McNamara and Maxwell to the apartment when Officer Rufo came into the kitchen and said, “They threw a bag out of the window.”</text>
            <text syncTime="650.372" offset="2704906">Rufo opened the kitchen window, stepped out on the fire escape, went down on the landing in the second floor, picked up the brown paper bag and brought it back to the kitchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.068" offset="2755688">McNamara opened the bag and discovered inside wrapped in wax paper, a 32 caliber automatic and 45 caliber revolver together with a number of 32 caliber and 45 caliber bullets.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.399" offset="2816920">McNamara thereupon placed Painten under arrest and proceeded to make a thorough search of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.191" offset="2844087">In the course of the search, McNamara found and seized the box of 32 caliber bullets and under a mattress in Painten's bedroom about $980.00 in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.268" offset="2896436">Later the same evening, either police officers found and seized a roll of waxed paper, edge of which corresponded with the edge of the wax paper that had been used to wrap the guns and ammunition found in the paper bag.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.700" offset="3438216">In setting aside Painten's conviction however and directing the Commonwealth of Massachusetts either devote a new trial or to discharge him, the courts below relied on elements in the record which could not have been seen or heard by a neutral observer.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.546" offset="3497566">These consist of McNamara's own impressionistic attempts more than seven years after the events in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.905" offset="3618983">Thus as the District Court put it, I find that the officers went into the apartment intending to ask Painten a few questions and then they arrest him on suspicion of the loan company job.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.040" offset="3903509">The District Court then finding that he did intend to arrest him on suspicion of a loan company job by going to say in so finding, I have in mind the statement by Officer McNamara at the hearing here that if Painten have not gone from the car into the liquor store, he would have asked him and Ash a few questions and then quoting McNamara, “I believe I would have taken him to the station for a suspicion of that hold up that day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.442" offset="4193155">Answered by McNamara, “Yes sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.474" offset="4345292">The meeting mentioned of McNamara as additional reference a moment later, the officer coming in discovering the guns and in this connection McNamara's testimony could be read as meaning, “These other things I had in mind plus the discovery the guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.858" offset="4406836">” This is the second reference by McNamara.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.928" offset="4419062">It is not included in the Court of Appeals quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.894" offset="4430973">The Court observes, “It is apparent that the police knowing of a crime and knowing that Ash and petitioner were suspicious characters, but having no reason to connect them with the crime they are investigating set out to arrest and searched the man in the hope that evidence would develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.626" offset="4525850">” The courts below have thus rested their invalidation of a state court conviction fully on a police officer's efforts to bridge up from the remote subconscious, his motives through action which took place more than seven years earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.667" offset="7078013">Maybe it was not in expressed words but I would like to call to the attention of the Court respectfully that on page 55 of the record which is part of the findings of the United States District Court, the Court says, it follows that the entrance into Painten's apartment without a warrant and absent to any probable cause to arrest any occupant thereof was “under column of their police authority” and citing Johnson against United States and there was no “valid basis in law for the intrusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.749" offset="12198327">And we have that -- we have that in a number of cases that the Commonwealth -- the petitioner seeks to distinguish another case which is relied on by the United States Court of Appeals, the case of Hobson and in the Hobson case which appears in both of our briefs, we have something of this element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.307" offset="12280560">We had officers approaching the house and somebody in the house opening a back window just like in Painten's case and throwing the material out the back window and it fell all the way to the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.827" offset="12326640">Now in this case, in Hobson, the Court had found that there was the involuntary act of the tenant and this was the cartilage, within the cartilage of the property and within the protected area under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.272" offset="12388498">The petitioner seeks to distinguish this saying that in the Hobson case, officers broke through the door and this compelled the property to be thrown out the window but of course if the Hobson case is read, this is simply not the factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.633" offset="12465925">In Hobson, the material was thrown out the window when the police came to the door and in fact in Hobson unless I'm mistaken be a the same thing, somebody came to the door and said to the police, “Wait a minute, my wife has to get dressed” and closed the door and I think they use a peep hole in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.896" offset="12542934">They didn't have to open the door, but in any even in Hobson, the property was thrown out the window when the police came to the door and then the officer posted in the back of the house called to the men in front and said, “They just threw something out the window.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.083" offset="12607718">And with that, the officers burst into the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.872" offset="12618898">So it was not the bursting through the door that compelled the throwing of the material out the window in Hobson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.446" offset="12641155">It was the appearing on the scene by the police officers which provoked the tenant to throw the material into his backyard and this was held protected, a protected area and the material was not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.662" offset="12694026">I think this is a good case employed by the United States Court below and I think it's a case that have every bit of validity before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.002" offset="12767378">You know, both my distinguished brother and I come from Massachusetts and we have a tradition in Massachusetts that began 200 years ago and this Court knows very well when James Otis, Jr. argued for the discontinuance of the writs of assistance and I feel as though Massachusetts should not be down here today arguing before this Court that the right of privacy and the Fourth Amendment should not receive every bit of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.917" offset="12899035">It should not have every bit of substance as pronounced by this Court, traditionally before this Court and should be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.810" offset="12930591">If this Court were to decide in a manner in which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is asking today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.866" offset="12954833">I think it would mean a regression from what the Fourth Amendment has come to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.426" offset="12977089">I think it would be a diminution surely of what the right of privacy means in this country today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.381" offset="13008854">We've come a long way with the development of the Fourth Amendment and the right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.584" offset="13025677">I don't think that there's anything compelling either in this case or in the general picture of the country today that warrants detracting from what the right of privacy has come to mean and what the Fourth Amendment has come to mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.957" offset="13131212">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.621" offset="13141870">Massachusetts certainly is proud of its contributions historically to the development of the protections of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.176" offset="13176038">At the same time, Massachusetts has also recognized the validity of the observation of this Court in Kerr against California that the states are not precluded from developing workable rules governing arrest, searches and seizures to meet the practical demand of effective criminal investigation and law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.842" offset="13266735">The courts of Massachusetts indeed from their earliest history have been engaged in the process of developing just such workable rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.491" offset="13305292">In so doing, they have been mindful in the words of the supreme judicial court in Massachusetts in Commonwealth against Lawton that a police officer in the solution of a crime and in the presence of when he thinks committed it, is not adjudged with time for mature consideration and the contrary in this position more nearly resembles that in the sentry it is post in time of war, upon his alertness and judgment depends the safety of many?</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.026" offset="13415528">The importance of this case, we believe is that, we have here on the one side a series of steps taken by police officers which in the point of view of those of us who represent law enforcement do constitute the exercise of alertness and intelligence in the carrying out of their responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.511" offset="13501419">The issue before this Court is whether in substance it shall validate that kind of course of conduct or whether it shall say to the police, “No, you may not do this” even though each step along the course they take is justified in the light of the knowledge and experience and the information available to them at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3605.400" offset="14525001">Our position basically is that granted that the findings may have been correct as to the intent of the police officers and then what they did in fact and the reasonableness of what they did in the light of all the circumstances ought to be the test and alone should be the test of whether or not their action was or was not constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.433" offset="14625102">It follows, this follows immediately from what I read before, it follows that the entrance into the Painten's apartment without a warrant and absent -- any probable cause to arrest any occupant thereof was “under color of their police authority” and there was “no valid basis in law for the intrusion” citing Johnson versus United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3669.047" offset="14779538">The difference between this case and the Johnson case cited there is that they smelled the opium in the Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.265" offset="14804407">The occupant of the hotel room opened the door and the officer said, “You're under arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3826.208" offset="15408253">We say first of all that this is implausible in the light what actually transpired, but in any event as Mr. Justice Brennan has just restated our position that it is irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3840.557" offset="15465618">The difficulty about United States against Johnson as I see it is that in that case there was a consent or acquiescence consent -- consents and there was a smell of opium coming out into the hall but this Court held that search warrant was necessary and that the entry was unlawful because it was compelled in the sense that there's always coercion implicit in a police request to come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3904.033" offset="15719528">There's a fundamental distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3959.906" offset="15943032">Now, we would concede here that there was no cause of arrest at the time of the entry.</text>
