            <text syncTime="26.505" offset="209377">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.740" offset="226304">This case concerns the rights of illegitimate children under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.457" offset="249187">Specifically, the question is whether a state can deny children born to an unmarried woman the benefits of a statute permitting children generally to sue for the wrongful death of their mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.355" offset="312822">The facts in the case are simple and uncontested.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.725" offset="330271">The decedent, Mrs. Louise Levy was the mother of five infant children whose interests are at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.652" offset="366007">The children lived with their mother and were dependent on her.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.130" offset="383875">The defendants in the case in this Court are Dr. W.J. Wing of the Charity Hospital of New Orleans and an insurance company, the Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.204" offset="432149">On March 12, 1964, Mrs. Levy went to the Charity Hospital feeling ill and having other symptoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.274" offset="464436">She was assigned to Dr. Wing who purported to examine here but failed to take blood test and make other checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.171" offset="496097">On March 19, Mrs. Levy returned and she was still feeling ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.132" offset="519920">Dr. Wing admonished her for not taking the medicine that he had prescribed and he suggested that she see a psychiatrist and in fact, he made an appointment with her to see a psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.380" offset="568926">On March 22nd, Mrs. Levy was brought to the hospital in a comatose condition, on March 29th, she died.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.665" offset="602049">This suit was filed in the Louisiana courts under Article 2315 of the Louisiana code, the wrongful death statute of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.787" offset="646562">Two elements of damages were alleged, totalling $60,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.518" offset="665475">$55,000.00 was alleged as the damages that these children suffered for the loss of their mother prior to the age of majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.121" offset="699852">This is the wrongful death element.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.244" offset="708315">$5,000.00 was alleged as the survivorship portion of the damages for the decedent's pain and suffering before she died.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.905" offset="755022">After procedural matters were taken care of in the lower court, the trial court dismissed the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.421" offset="781040">This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Louisiana and one reason was given for denying these illegitimate children the right to sue and the words of the Louisiana Court of Appeals, the decision is "actually based on morals and general welfare because it discourages bringing children into the world out of wedlock".</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman Dorsen</label>
            <text syncTime="215.658" offset="965987">That's quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.411" offset="972988">The Supreme Court of Louisiana without opinion refused the writ of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.912" offset="991065">It's the position in this Court that the appellants take that this application of Article 2315 is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.707" offset="1026173">First, because it violates the Equal Protection Clause, denying the children rights on the basis of suspect criteria, the status of illegitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.033" offset="1063476">Second, because it's a violation of Equal Protection Clause on the ground of a statutory classification is unreasonable in light of the purpose of Article 2315.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.400" offset="1104959">And three, that it's a violation of due process because the discrimination for there is no valid state purpose and deprives the children of rights on the basis of a status over which they have no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.060" offset="1159607">Our first point is that the classification is unreasonable in light of the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.976" offset="1187297">The principle in this Court is ancient and clear and we quoted in the brief on page 9 where the Court said as long ago as 1896 that the attempted classification must always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just relation to the Act in respect to which the classification is proposed and can never be made arbitrarily and without any such basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.874" offset="1290846">Of course more recent cases like Carrington and Rash and McLaughlin and Florida adopt and apply this rule of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.173" offset="1328044">The application of this principle, it seems to us is equally plain in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.980" offset="1351241">It's the purpose of the wrongful death portion of the statute to save children harmless from the loss of the material and moral benefits that they would have received if their mother had lived, the mother in whom they were dependent, the mother with whom they resided and this of course is the purpose of all wrongful death statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.049" offset="1427519">In this case, it seems to us, it's wholly unreasonable to discriminate against the illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.309" offset="1448626">They were as close to their mother as any children could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.157" offset="1463986">They were fully dependent on her for both the economic necessities and the intangibles of training, nurture and guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.192" offset="1496168">Indeed Louisiana Workman's Compensation Law which has been applied to permit dependence to recover under the Workman's Compensation law even if they're illegitimate, points up in our judgement the unreasonable nature of the classification here.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.112" offset="1563773">When one turns to the survivorship portion of the statute, the purpose is only slightly different but there is an added element and that is to reinforce the deterrent aspects of the general tort law by refusing to permit wrongdoers to escape payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.828" offset="1634722">This stated in the statute itself and by an authoritative law review article in Louisiana which on page 16 states, "The idea apparently evolved that the person responsible for the wrongful act should pay damages to someone connected with the deceased whether or not that person was dependent on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.065" offset="1723643">And of course in this case, the children were dependent on the mother and there is no reason that I can think of and no reason has been suggested, I respectfully say to the Court, why this children like any other children should not be able to bring this course of action on behalf of their -- in their status as dependents and children of the mother with whom they lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.452" offset="1825207">Now, the justification, the only justification that was given in the Louisiana court was the idea that illegitimacy would be deterred by rule of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.678" offset="1874108">Not only was this assertion unsupported by factual data but with all candor, it seems to me, to be a wholly unbelievable assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.961" offset="1919248">It assumes that those in the process of begetting children will assume all of the following eventualities.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.054" offset="1947564">The possibility of pregnancy that there will be no later marriage or other method of legitimating the children that the children will not be acknowledged, that the mother would subsequently die at the hands of a tortfeasor, not only of a tortfeasor but in the hands of a solvent or insured tortfeasor and not only that but within the jurisdiction of Louisiana.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="486.555" offset="2049546">Well, even if you assume that the mother found all those things and it's hardly renounced to her benefit, she is dead.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.762" offset="2086431">We have to bear in mind here that the people on whose behalf the lawsuit is being brought are the innocent children of this woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.675" offset="2114121">They have had no and could have had no control over to their status.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.702" offset="2130213">So we have here innocent children, no control over their status, a wrong doer, avoiding the consequences of his act and not only that, despite with all respect, the assertions in the brief of the appellee, Louisiana is the only jurisdiction at the present time that would have this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.886" offset="2218924">Four other states are mentioned as possibly reaching the same result under existing law New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana and New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.538" offset="2629569">It was passed in 1966 session, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.802" offset="2650572">Now, there is one other element in this case that of course underlies the first claim in point of pagination and that is, we have here a minority, a minority that in the words of Justice Stone and his famous footnote for Carolene Products is a discrete and insular minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.377" offset="2740851">It's a minority that has characteristics similar to the racial classifications that this Court of course has been dealing with for so many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.349" offset="2784737">We have here a minority that has been the subject of prejudice and abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.856" offset="2802813">This prejudice, moreover, is motivated by complex, historical, psychological and sociological factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.773" offset="2834474">In the words of one psychiatrist who made an extensive study of illegitimacy quoted in the amicus curiae brief of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons, "illegitimacy is a psychic catastrophe, not only as of the psychic catastrophe, not only is it a believed minority but a discrimination against the people in the category of illegitimacy stems from a condition of birth unrelated to individual capacities, uncontrollable by the individuals themselves."</text>
            <text syncTime="716.709" offset="2970206">Indeed, in one respect, one can even assert that this is an a fortiori case for race.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.480" offset="2997269">Because unlike the situation of minority racial groups, there is no lobby for the illegitimate and in the footnote 4 in Carolene Products and in other cases, this Court has recognized that particular care must be had in scrutinizing statutes where the ordinary political processes are unable to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.195" offset="3080129">And it seems to us that this is such a case and that these people are in the category analogous to the racial minorities.</text>
