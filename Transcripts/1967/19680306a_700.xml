            <label>Mr. J. Brad Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="55.211" offset="324211">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.707" offset="334242">The petitioner in this case is a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.717" offset="350229">The petitioner was indicted, tried and convicted in Maury County, Tennessee in 1949 for the offense of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.885" offset="390875">He contends in this case that Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand jury which indicted him and from the petty jury which tried and convicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.627" offset="437896">The salient facts in the case are wholly undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.404" offset="460988">The census reports from Maury County were introduced into evidence in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.747" offset="486379">They showed that in excess of 20% of the total population of Maury County, at all relevant times, were Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.073" offset="531623">The proof also showed without dispute that prior to and including the time of petitioner's indictment, trial and conviction, no Negro, none whatever had ever served on any grand or petty jury in Maury County.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.195" offset="624201">There's absolutely no question and I would hardly even think it necessary to mention it if it not for the fact that the District Court held otherwise that these two items make out a prima facie case of systematic exclusion showing a substantial percentage of the population to be Negro and showing an absolute failure of service at any time on the part of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.563" offset="741648">As stated, the District Court nevertheless held that petitioner had failed to make out a prima facie case.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.838" offset="774771">His conviction was in 1949, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.942" offset="787101">His habeas corpus hearing in the Federal District Court was in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.671" offset="858049">The case of Norris versus Alabama I think is completely determinative of this point of the prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.409" offset="897024">The case quite somewhat similar in all respects except the percentage of Negroes in Jackson County, Alabama was much, much smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.156" offset="927953">This is 294 U.S. 590 showing about 8% of the population to be Negro, on 591 showing that there had never been any service by Negroes on grand or petty jury and the court then states that testimony in itself made out a prima facie case of the denial of the equal protection which the Constitution guarantees.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.394" offset="1072985">I was appointed to represent the petitioner for the first time by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.439" offset="1101093">I -- I have no idea why the petition was not filed earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.338" offset="1124707">Is there any background in the state courts that would point toward the reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="261.654" offset="1149994">There must have been some -- some indication of when the first attack is conviction in the state courts other than on appeal, if you did appeal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_brad_reed" startTime="274.431" stopTime="372.796">
            <label>Mr. J. Brad Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="274.431" offset="1201089">There was no appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.191" offset="1208090">I'm not advised, Your Honor, as to when the habeas corpus proceeding in the State Court on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.288" offset="1232541">Mr. Davies informed me that it was in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.917" offset="1255006">I have an idea as to perhaps why the challenge was not previously made.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.899" offset="1274964">Of course, it was around that time that habeas corpus became -- that the use of the writ became prevalent and it kind of enters throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.622" offset="1317909">Also, Mr. Davies relies heavily, and I will attempt to show that his reliance is misplaced on a Tennessee Supreme Court decision concerning a prior conviction in Maury County some two years prior to the -- I suppose three years prior to the petitioner's indictment and conviction in which the question of systematic exclusion was raised, proof was taken and the Court held that systematic exclusion had not been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.419" offset="1461060">Certiorari was sought in this Court and denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.762" offset="1482376">I think that I will be able to convince the Court that the questions asked and the reasoning employed by the Tennessee Court in that case were erroneous and that the -- that the facts presented in the case was erroneously decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.297" offset="1548518">Nevertheless, this case -- this Court did not choose to review the case at that time and this may have had some inhibiting effect on the petitioner.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Brad Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="374.794" offset="1602539">Your Honor, the decision of the Tennessee Supreme Court was in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.627" offset="1621870">The array of the grand and petty jury that was challenged was in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.881" offset="1658859">I am -- I'm speaking strictly on the record, Your Honor, expressing interest in -- and I would guess that was -- that was what it is and I'm sure that Mr. Davies will -- will say that's what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.336" offset="1716746">At any rate, on the decisions beginning with Norris which was in 19 -- in 35 through Patton versus Mississippi in 47, Whitus decided last term and Coleman versus Alabama decided this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.146" offset="1779963">Petitioner clearly made out a prima facie case, shifted the burden, at least the burden of going forward to the respondent to prove that what the introduce evidence to the fact that Negroes had not been systemically excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.520" offset="1853419">The respondent's first attempt to show no systematic exclusion was to say that petitioner had not shown that any Negroes were qualified for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.429" offset="1913083">Well, in the first place, respondent misconstrues the nature of the prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.182" offset="1944116">The burden is shifted to him to introduce evidence to the effect that Negroes are not qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.849" offset="1974732">The prima facie case has already been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.384" offset="1984867">It's very clear under Norris and the later decisions that the prima facie case is made out by showing a substantial percentage of Negroes in the population, not -- it is not necessary to show that a substantial percentage of Negroes aren't qualified for jury service.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.148" offset="2163963">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.974" offset="2167306">It's right in the middle of Tennessee but in the southern portion of middle Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.076" offset="2199698">The respondent introduced the statutes setting forth the relevant qualifications for jurors which were fairly usual for this time which was 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.949" offset="2259153">They have since been changed but the qualifications set forth by the Tennessee statutes -- and this -- this is set forth in -- in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.208" offset="2288201">It's a combination of the general statute and the private act, which applied only to Maury County.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.319" offset="2316622">Adult, male freeholders or householders and upright intelligent men known for their integrity, fair character and sound judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.219" offset="2364270">Respondent introduced no proof whatever that a smaller percentage of Negroes were adult males as compared with white adult males than the percentage of Negroes in the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.239" offset="2440338">Respondent introduced no proof that a smaller percentage of Negroes than whites were freeholders or that a smaller percentage were white -- were householders or that a smaller percentage were upright intelligent men known for their integrity, fair character and sound judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.167" offset="2520064">So it's our contention that the respondent has wholly failed in his attempt to carry the burden of showing that fewer Negroes than -- or that a smaller percentage of Negroes than those in the general population which was in excess of 20% were eligible for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.742" offset="2602297">Respondent introduced proof that the jurors were selected from the tax rolls but again introduced no evidence that a smaller percentage of Negroes than the 20% in the general population were taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.352" offset="2660812">The Court has no evidence therefore on which to base any finding except that in excess of 20% of those persons eligible for jury duty were Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.329" offset="2708668">Respondent or rather petitioner was not satisfied with relying solely on the respondent's failure to carry the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.582" offset="2749733">So in the Court of Appeals to the extent possible at that time, we attempted to show that the result gained by respondent's failure to carry the burden of proof was in fact the correct result in this panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.679" offset="2814098">We introduced by agreement the sub-census I suppose you would call it, breaking down the population figures from the total population into adult male Negroes and adult male whites, which is the largest category under the jury qualification statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.603" offset="2901765">This showed, as you might guess, that again in excess of 20% of all adult males in Maury County were Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.316" offset="2944606">Then -- and this is found in our brief in footnote 1 an examination of the Tennessee authorities as to what a person had to be in order to constitute a householder.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.733" offset="3006255">An adult male householder unquestionably is qualified for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.746" offset="3026317">The only way to determine how many freeholders there were would be to go to the tax records.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.515" offset="3045439">This was respondent's responsibility and he did not carry it.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.219" offset="3072293">We examined the Tennessee authorities in detail and it set this forth in the brief to show that virtually all adult males are householders under the Tennessee law, and I won't belabor the point by discussing it here, but it's set forth in detail in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.723" offset="3146271">So -- so they're not being satisfied to rely wholly on the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.317" offset="3172603">Petitioner weren't here and went forward himself and showed that -- that in fact an excess of 20% of those persons eligible for jury duty were Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.483" offset="3221295">And we think that the courts below and this Court have no evidence to base any finding other than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.710" offset="3274167">Respondent next attempted to rebut petitioner's prima facie case and I may state that the Court of Appeals held that contrary to the District Court that a prima facie case had been made out but held that respondent had rebutted that case successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.073" offset="3359640">They -- in doing so, they relied upon the elements which I will discuss important and important for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.175" offset="3400077">What was the nature of respondent's rebuttal evidence with respect to selection?</text>
            <text syncTime="828.734" offset="3418258">Well, as a background, perhaps it would be helpful to briefly discuss the method by which jurors are selected in Maury County.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.368" offset="3456815">First, the circuit judge appoints jury commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.696" offset="3474160">These commissioners then biannually select from whatever source they use and there was evidence of the tax books we use but again, no evidence that a smaller percentage of Negroes then in the general population were property owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.766" offset="3546467">They select a large list which is known as the general venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.701" offset="3566216">These lists for the particular general venire are from which the juries that indicted and convicted petitioner was selected consisting of 1,501 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.841" offset="3618774">This list was used for a two-year period and from this list before every term of court, three times each year, they were selected by a -- the names of all 1,501 were placed on individual slips of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.552" offset="3681573">Before each term a boy, member as ten years of age drew a hundred or approximately a hundred names out of the box in which these 1,501 names were placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.010" offset="3731414">And that list of 100 is called the venire facias.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.408" offset="3753044">Obviously, we have no complaint about the method of selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.165" offset="3764015">They are completely at random.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.065" offset="6611675">And there was one further evidence that with which we dealt in the brief and I think should be dealt with here, and that was as to the configuration of the general venire of 1500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.804" offset="6662562">The number of Negroes on the list of 100 would in large part depend on the number of Negroes on the list of 1,500 because we admit that the list of 100, the venire facias was selected from the list of 1,500 at random.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.581" offset="6745736">A -- A boy ten years of age just drew the names out of a box, from a box containing the 1,500 names.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.977" offset="6775306">And consequently, the number which would appear on the list of 100 would depend very substantially on the number which appeared in the list of 1,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.036" offset="6815535">There is some proof with reference to the number which appeared on the list of 1,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.037" offset="6843538">This was in the affidavit introduced by the respondent, the affidavit of Judge Joe M. Ingram, the circuit judge who had tried the -- or who had been the judge during the trial of the petitioner for the offense with which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.202" offset="6928175">Judge Ingram's testimony was to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.936" offset="6951163">First, he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.934" offset="6959104">“There was no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.253" offset="6964433">I wouldn't appoint anybody who would discriminate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.660" offset="6974046">Well, I've dealt with that -- that sort of testimonies in type but no weight in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.213" offset="7000273">Secondly, he listed -- named 22 Negroes whose names appeared on the general venire of 1,501.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.879" offset="7054921">His affidavit stated that he had discovered these from a casual examination of the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.691" offset="7086164">Well, I looked at the list of 1501 and as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out this morning or asked this morning, there's no designation as to race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.425" offset="7333073">And it's for that reason that I have attempted to continue to emphasize the fact that the burden of going forward is now on the respondent and if the respondent is going to attempt to introduce into evidence the names of Negroes who appeared on the general venire, then he better make sure that he's introducing all of them because since the burden is on him, the Court when the list is presented to it has really no alternative but to assume that this is the total regardless of the nature of the testimony and the qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.403" offset="7472985">I agreed fully the judge did not state that this was all, but I think that this is the only thing in the record from which the lower courts and this Court can make any determination of how many Negroes there were, and this was the evidence that they offered to show that there was no systematic exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.506" offset="7557413">Now, all that we have done is to show I think from the brief using elementary probability theory that this evidence proffered to show that there was no systematic exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.889" offset="7618957">It has no such a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.960" offset="7627212">That the probability is so miniscule that it's -- it is as a practical matter impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.950" offset="7659186">But for 22 to have been selected -- we don't know how many were selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.701" offset="7678203">All we are trying to do is as the respondent who has the burden of proof introduces evidence on a particular point, we simply attempt to meet that evidence and show that in that particular, he has not carried his burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.596" offset="7737762">And so it's in that context and in that limited context that our use of the probability theory with respect to 22 is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.377" offset="7780916">And we did go somewhat further and that is, as stated earlier, the attorney for -- the attorney for petitioner in his trial in 1949 who's called as a witness by respondent stated that sometimes two and sometimes three Negroes were on the list of 100 on the general venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.889" offset="7870882">Taking the maximum number that he stated 3%, 3 out of 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.071" offset="7899617">We again applied the same -- as best as we could, we took their proof and assumed that if 3% were on the list of hundred, then we would maximize and transfer that assumption to the general venire and assume that 3% were on the general venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.211" offset="7976208">And this would result in 45 instead of 22 Negroes being on the general venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.156" offset="8004002">Again, we don't know how many were on the general venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.853" offset="8014764">We are simply attempting to meet the respondent in each instance where he tries to introduce evidence to show that there was no systematic exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.932" offset="11095124">Well, this results again from there being so few or too few Negroes on the general venire of 1,500 when a random selection from a list of 1,500 -- when a series of random selections from a list of 1,500 never produces more than three Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.364" offset="11180805">There are very few more than 3% on the list of 1,500.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.723" offset="11238275">The evidence in the District Court was to the effect that the Negroes who were called never more than three always asked to be excused and always were excused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.455" offset="11329181">They simply ask the judge in every instance, so the testimony went, to be excused and the excuse -- well, not that there was an excuse the judge did excuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.434" offset="11389158">There was admittedly testimony to the effect that the judge was very liberal with whites, also.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.512" offset="11517471">It's presumably known that the judge will excuse Negroes who asked to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.122" offset="11547878">There's an obvious pressure on Negroes under these circumstances to seek excusal from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.856" offset="11598764">We think that the situation is such, that there is an easy remedy, and that is for the judge to be required to grant excuses not only to Negroes but to whites only when there's a legal -- legal ground for excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.655" offset="11682043">We don't suggest that he shouldn't excuse Negroes without cause but should excuse whites because we are trying to force service by Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.026" offset="11727496">We don't submit that that should be done, but he can even handedly grant or disallow excuse from service by simply requiring legal excuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.228" offset="11976286">But the Court reserved the question and I think indicated its opinion in that reservation as to what the decision would be if the peremptory challenge system were always used consistently over a period of time with the result that no Negro ever served.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.442" offset="13281155">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.844" offset="13298709">The position of the respondent of the State of Tennessee, if you will, is really quite easily stated on whether it's so easily sustained, I believe remains to be the same and the position is this, this Court has many, many times been called to pass upon jury discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.757" offset="13390451">But this case is distinguishable from all but one of the other cases decided by this Court because this is a federal habeas corpus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.574" offset="13449697">In many of the cases decided previously by this Court, the Court has said, we must pay great respect to the determination of the facts made by the highest court of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.523" offset="13513435">But, we also have to make our own determination where the federal question is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.652" offset="13545932">The only other federal habeas corpus case involving discrimination that I have been able to find, Brown verus Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.953" offset="13583235">And on that particular point, this case of course involved many points, but on this particular point, the Court held in favor of the convicting authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.001" offset="13627329">Now in this case then, it's my conclusion that the issue is, was the decision of the district judge clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.860" offset="13678843">If it was clearly erroneous on the federal rules of Civil Procedure 52 (a) them this Court must reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.972" offset="13719280">If on the other hand there is evidence in the record to sustain the finding of the District Court then it is my opinion that this Court may not make its own determination as to the federal question involved but must sustain the determination made by the district judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3710.480" offset="14945259">There, I was faced as counsel for the respondent with some 15 as I recall, different allegations of unconstitutionality running the gamut from failing to give him a copy of his indictment, failing in giving jury list, inadequacy of counsel, everything that you can think of was brought into the Court as well as the only question as before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.800" offset="15046614">It has been stated that the reason for taking Mr. Tomlinson's proof, the defense counsel's proof was purely to show what his testimony was on the jury discrimination issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.753" offset="15098337">This is not an accurate statement because this is the lawyer that is petitioned -- that the petitioner states was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.733" offset="15126340">And there were many different issues that these witnesses were called upon to testify in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.804" offset="15150582">Now further, the proof in the District Court was this and if there was a prima facie case created it is this case that after the respondent was called upon to revert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.690" offset="15206170">The proof was this, no Negro had sat as a member of a petit jury or of the grand jury prior to the petitioner's trail in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.678" offset="15270118">That is -- 1949 I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.506" offset="15281403">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.372" offset="15284851">Because we have no proof in contrary of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.979" offset="15299271">Further, Negroes constituted a substantial portion of the population of Maury County, some 20% I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.649" offset="15345977">Third, obviously, some weren't qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.011" offset="15363427">Now, the petitioner did not prove that some were qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.362" offset="15380773">Actually, the respondent proved that some were qualified because the respondent put on the proof of Mr. Tomlinson and the Attorney General Douglas and of the trial judge who showed by their testimony that some were qualified or else it would never be in the jury roles if they weren't qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.497" offset="15469380">So the proof was, some were qualified.</text>

            <text syncTime="5007.922" offset="20135058">Now, the petitioner would take the respondent to test for failing then to come in and show what percentage of this were not qualified and my answer to that is on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.425" offset="20189080">One, why and how do you go about proving something after the evidentiary hearing has closed other than by stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.875" offset="20226905">Two, why should I attempt to introduce proof on an issue which he conceded in the Court of Appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.075" offset="20259715">The petitioner did concede in the Court of Appeals that there was no discrimination in the Constitution of the overall jury list.</text>

            <text syncTime="5329.986" offset="21423313">But let's take this in regard to the mathematical argument which the petitioner have now advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.708" offset="21446196">I do not feel that this argument is valid in this case because one, there is no proof that there were only 22 Negroes on the 1501 jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.642" offset="21501889">There was no proof as to the number of white men or Negro men on the tax rolls and the jury list were taken from the tax rolls and there is no distinction on the tax rolls between white and Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.683" offset="21562075">There's no distinction on the jury list between white and Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.971" offset="21579212">The census report showing the breakdown as to adult males was not before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.658" offset="21605961">The mathematician came up with all these figure has never yet testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.070" offset="21627695">I've never seen him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.513" offset="21633442">This was all brought in to the record even after the Court of Appeals passed on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5457.015" offset="21931447">Alright, this then is what he came in to the District Court and proved as I've stated again and again that some none served, there were numerous in the county, some were qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.470" offset="22001246">The respondent then came further to show yes, that is true and every time the court through Mr. Tomlinson and Attorney General Bumpus and the trial judge, some were called and those that were called told me the juries that didn't want to serve and they were excused for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.171" offset="22076061">Now, that's the explanation of the state and that's why I said early, it's relatively easy to state now whether or not it's so easily sustained is up to the Court and not to me but that is the position of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="5512.155" offset="22152025">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.120" offset="22159862">There is one manner that the Court may have are completely in mind but I'm not sure if Mr. Davies does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.458" offset="22197164">He keeps talking about the fact that we didn't prove there were any qualified, any Negroes who were qualified jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.305" offset="22224541">If I may quote from Norris versus Alabama as to point a prima facie case comes into effect, maybe this will help.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.037" offset="22255470">This was following the testimony that Negroes constituted some way around, well, a large substantial percent of the population and that none had ever served.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.126" offset="22307924">The Court then says, that testimony in itself made out of prima facie case of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.336" offset="22340733">The case does made was supplemented by direct testimony that specified Negroes who qualify and that makes it absolutely clear that it is not part of my case to prove that any Negroes were qualified or have approved years that they constituted a substantial portion of the population and that none had ever served.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.438" offset="22449089">On the question of whether or not the clearly erroneous rule applies, I don't think it's necessary for the Court to reach that question for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.065" offset="22483675">I'm reading from the appendix page 58, the District Court's opinion, petitioner has failed to establish a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.109" offset="22523800">Well, I -- assuming arguendo that the clear erroneous rule applies, it couldn't be anymore clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.114" offset="22559848">He then goes on to consider the other evidence having held that no prima facie case was made and he has obviously considered the evidence in the wrong light.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.895" offset="22614915">We're not asking as Mr. Davies implied that a judge forced a Negro to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.489" offset="22649292">In fact, I have attempted to scrupulously avoid such a suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5641.840" offset="22670712">We are suggesting that the Court not excuse anybody, white or Negro without cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.529" offset="22709478">That's all we're asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.205" offset="22716165">When he had the reason that they have never served, I think Mr. Davies was exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.387" offset="22756916">They've always -- on the record shows that they've always asked to be excused whether they have had cause or not, the judge is excused where you can even-handedly stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.169" offset="22804041">You don't require Negroes to do anything different than from whites, you just require the judge to not excuse someone unless there's legal excuse or legal reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.103" offset="22855764">Now, with respect to the use of statistics in this case, the -- I admit there is a problem, I didn't represent the petitioner in the District Court and consequently, I have attempted to use presumptions to establish some of the figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.635" offset="22937893">I think that we've justified in doing this because of the proof in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.352" offset="22960776">I think there's sufficient proof in the record to show how many Negroes were on a particular list.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.413" offset="23001004">The best evidence of this in fact is in the Kennedy case which Mr. Davies relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.304" offset="23024619">They go to great trouble to name or rather to list a number of Negroes on the general venire as being -- the case says there were nine Negroes out of a 110 where two of them were dead and one of them had moved out the county and so I think we put it well not count those.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.731" offset="23122317">Of the remaining living residence, 6.6% of the list of a hundred or in this 106 were Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.773" offset="23170487">Now, we have shown and the same was true in Kennedy who has no proof that a lesser percentage of the population was Negro or rather a less percentage of qualified jurors were Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.894" offset="23230986">And therefore, I think that not only is it reasonable to assume, the Court must assume that the same percentage of Negroes were qualified for jury duty as it was in the percentage of Negro Adult male residents of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.428" offset="23297128">Using that percentage, we have shown in our brief that a composition of a venire facias of a hundred or 106 containing 6.6% Negroes would happen would occur at random list in once in a million times.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.125" offset="23375914">Now, we submit this solely to show that the selection was not made at random.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.957" offset="23403186">The Supreme Court said, you see here, this evidence shows that a random selection or shows no systematic exclusion.</text>
