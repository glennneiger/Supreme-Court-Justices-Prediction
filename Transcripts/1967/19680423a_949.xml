            <label>Ms. Mary Lee Stapp</label>
            <text syncTime="28.756" offset="218363">May it please the Court and Mr. Chief Justice in this honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.111" offset="239783">I represent the appellants, Mr. Reuben K. King and the State Board of Pensions and Security which is the host in making Single State Agency in the Department of Alabama responsible for the title for of the Social Security Act, the public assistance title known as Aid to Dependent Children in Alabama and on the national level, Aid to Families With Dependent Children.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.902" offset="354931">We have been designated as a single State agent, said to effectuate the purposes of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.784" offset="382516">And we are here on a suit of class action, suit in which the three judge panel starts down to Alabama substitute parent regulation as being violated by the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.005" offset="463391">The lower court essentially held that the regulation of deprived, needy children of Equal Protection, and we are here to state the validity of the regulation and to show this Court that it is a reasonable classification particularly in the light of the Alabama Program and in the effort we are trying to make in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.734" offset="590346">The facts stated in the opinion by the lower Court are essentially facts that both counsel agree upon, there is -- I will briefly state them.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.154" offset="643950">The plaintiff was the mother of four children who had been receiving a Dependent Children.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.936" offset="671117">The policy, the substitute parent policy, was the plot against her, particularly I would say part two of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.854" offset="710823">She went into the District Court and eventually secured an hour of which struck down the entire regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.049" offset="755545">We all contend that when one of our main contentions is that the lower Court was incorrect in striking down all aspects of the regulation when only a portion of it are applied to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.576" offset="809671">We are concerned of the differences and facts that the lower Court stated with our version.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.752" offset="850422">The case worker who terminated the Aid in applying this substitute parent policy against her learned of the relationship between the plaintiff and a person we described as a substitute father but for the purposes of this court, you might think of it in terms of a substitute spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.376" offset="928893">We have a difficult semantic problem sometime with HEW and in trying to arrive at a good way to say things.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.375" offset="968913">We sometimes are misstating the essence of what we want to tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.355" offset="988766">This regulation which was applied against the plaintiff purported to and did describe what we call in Alabama as informal relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.515" offset="1049475">And our purpose is to try to place these informal relationships for purposes of public assistance in the same situation as persons who are married.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.464" offset="1093256">And the reason is it’s because persons who are married that is needy families do not get Aid in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.758" offset="1126379">The program is restricted to able bodied persons, who do not have any kind of espouse, for the living in a common law relationship, one that is not recognized by law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.194" offset="1188133">The plaintiff in this case considered that the case worker had learned of the relationship from some third party, I believe our version of it is that she had read it from the case record but had known about the relationship at the time when the policy was not in effect or the new case worker who came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.426" offset="1277053">And therefore went to the plaintiff and asked her about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.077" offset="1299728">And the plaintiff admitted or stated to the case worker, “Yes this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.953" offset="1323133">I do have this relationship which fits part two of the regulation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="308.914" offset="1339016">And on that basis Aid was terminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.758" offset="6738422">And you have specific authority in HEW to approve proper state plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.690" offset="6762141">And I suppose one of the significances of the Fleming ruling was it again reasserted the right of HEW to pass on state plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.220" offset="6792234">And of course, the Fleming rule by implication then became more of a statute in section 604.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.926" offset="6815117">Now with respect to the question of the step for the support, the federal handbook exception at Section 3412 Subdivision 4 states as follows, “In the absence of a legal obligation to assume a parental role, a step parent is no more of a parent than any other person acting on local apprentice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.043" offset="6891499">In these situations, the only safeguard to the child's right to assistance is its eligibility under the condition of being deprived of the support or care of the natural parent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.788" offset="6934549">Now the other parent spoken of in Section 3412 are all natural parents, whether married or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.636" offset="6961925">In other words, in Alabama if the man forced as an illegitimate child, he still can be compelled to support that child so long as he's the father.</text>

            <text syncTime="1748.861" offset="7098807">The word parent is used several times in the statute itself and an analysis of how it's used in the statute leaves no doubt but then they're talking about the natural parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.435" offset="7141125">Under Section 602, a state plan must have a provision which “provides a prompt notice to appropriate law enforcement officials of the furnishing of Aid to Families with Dependent Children in respect of the child who has been deserted or abandoned by a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.387" offset="7208939">Now the function of that notice provision to law enforcement officials is so that they can go out and compel support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.938" offset="7235166">Now under Alabama Law, and under the law of most of the states in this country, you can't compel support from anyone other than a natural parent or one who has adopted the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.517" offset="7281455">Now HEW then in its handbook, in transmittal which again is the official regulation concerning what is a parent, directs states to give notice regarding only those persons who under state laws are defined as parents for the support of minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.117" offset="7339865">Alabama's own welfare regulation states with respect to that notice provision, report parents who are legally responsible under Alabama Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.525" offset="7373511">These are the natural or adoptive parents of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.440" offset="7385109">A natural parent includes the father of a child born out of wedlock, if paternity has been legally established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.651" offset="7409977">It does not apply to a stepparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.438" offset="7421158">So the provision -- this attempted analogy that Mrs. Stapp was trying to make about an inconsistency, it's because the facts that she's talking about inconsistent with Alabama Law itself.</text>
