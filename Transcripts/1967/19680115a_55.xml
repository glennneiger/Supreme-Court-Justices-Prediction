            <label>Mr. Raymond J. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="10.484" offset="145324">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.318" offset="168626">This case is on a writ of certiorari from -- to the United States Court of Appeals from the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.662" offset="206033">The petitioners, Garrett and Simmons and a defendant Andrews were convicted after a jury trial on the charges of bank robbery with a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.531" offset="273533">All three men were sentenced to the custody of the attorney general for a period of three -- of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.248" offset="304358">Now, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals reversed the decision in Andrews on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.738" offset="342288">The first issue raised by the petitioner, Simmons here is that his pre-trial identifications were so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identity that he was deprived of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.332" offset="420655">On February 27th, 1964, two men robbed the Ben Franklin Savings and Loan Association in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.635" offset="453883">The two men were in the bank about five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.230" offset="464332">This occurred about 1:45 PM.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.659" offset="481991">The two men fled and took $1500 with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.259" offset="496410">A Mr. Misaika, who was one of the bank tellers left the bank and followed the two men and saw them drive away in a white 1960 Thunderbird.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.341" offset="548760">This car had a scrape, a large scrape along the door on the passenger's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.075" offset="583659">As soon as the police arrived, they made a general search of the area to find this car described by Mr. Misaika.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.106" offset="611767">At 2:30 PM, this search led to a white Thunderbird owned by Mary Ruth Rey who was a sister of the defendant, Andrews and the sister-in-law of the petitioner, Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.518" offset="669445">At 3 o'clock, six men entered the home of the mother of Andrews, searched but didn't take anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.371" offset="696822">At five o'clock that same day, the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered Andrews' mother's home looking for Andrews and Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.994" offset="743320">They did not find them but they did find two suitcases.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.795" offset="762546">One of which contained some bank money wrappers and other incriminating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.802" offset="790549">The next day, the FBI went to the home of Simmons' -- another of Simmons' sister-in-law and another sister of the defendant Andrews and obtained four or five pictures of Simmons and Andrews.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.219" offset="872260">Now, it is clear then, that same day they took these pictures to be viewed by the members of the bank that had witnessed the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.017" offset="915414">It is clear then that at the time that these pictures were shown to the witnesses, the FBI had two definite suspects in mind, Simmons and Andrews.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.492" offset="973302">It is also clear that the witnesses were aware that the FBI was close to a solution of the identity of the bank robbers because Mr. Misaika had seen this white Thunderbird.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.959" offset="1035160">He had also seen that car later in the day in the custody of the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.053" offset="1055535">So he knew that the car used in the bank robbery had been taken into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.753" offset="1078418">And he had talked over the facts and circumstances of the bank robbery with the other members of the bank, the tellers who were to be the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.848" offset="1122722">A Mrs.Parlimen also said that she was aware that the 1960 white Thunderbird had been used by the bank robbers and she hadn't talked to Mr. Misaika but had talked to some of the other bank tellers so that it was common knowledge among the tellers that the police were close to apprehending the bank robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.935" offset="1219062">Now, under those circumstances, number one, the FBI having two definite suspects in mind and number two, the bank teller witnesses being aware that the FBI was in hot pursuit of the bank robbers, these pictures were shown the very next day after the robbery to the tellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.430" offset="1313102">Now, there are two aspects to the showing of the pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.495" offset="1329403">The first one is that the use of multiple pictures of the petitioner, Simmons and the second was the limitation of other people depicted in the photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.697" offset="1398157">Now, on the first point, all of the five witnesses agree that more than one picture of Simmons was shown to the bank tellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.028" offset="1439535">Most of the witnesses said that there were three or four.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.031" offset="1455522">Mrs. Parlamen specifically remembering three and saying that there could have been four and that was the consensus of what the witnesses said.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.396" offset="1500975">No, they were snapshots, Your Honor taken from the sister and sister-in-law of these two men.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.762" offset="1534412">Yes they did, Your Honor but as I will try to point out because of the circumstances of the case and because of what all the other witnesses said, I think she was mistaken in what she had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.171" offset="1588015">Now, the FBI was not content with this initial showing of these pictures and they made -- there were various other showings of the pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.308" offset="1636603">In fact, right until the day before the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.859" offset="1650813">And once again, on each and every occasion, more than one picture of Simmons were shown and on most occasions, a number of three or four were shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.938" offset="1695117">Now all the witnesses said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.007" offset="1703372">Now, the Government in its answer, in no way tries to justify this aspect of the showing of the pictures, the multiple use of these pictures because there really is no justification for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.329" offset="1768678">Now, what were these witnesses --</text>

            <text syncTime="761.444" offset="3149197">Now, the second aspect of this showing of the pictures, were that the limitation of the other persons depicted in the photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.201" offset="3212204">Now, all the witnesses, except one who testified as to the number of the pictures said that there were five or six.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.175" offset="3248044">Now, remembering that the FBI had obtained four or five pictures from Andrews' sister, it is logical to conclude that those were the four or five pictures shown to the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.297" offset="3320560">We also have Mrs. Parlamen's testimony that two of them were of Andrews.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.361" offset="3344802">Well, with the two of Andrews and the three or four of Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.865" offset="3374791">It shows that likely, all of the pictures were of either Andrews or Simmons in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.851" offset="3406764">And I would like to point out too that after all these cross-examinations about how many pictures had been used, the Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who investigated the case never took the stand to say, “Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="838.892" offset="3458905">No, there were more than five or six pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.729" offset="3466324">We used 10 or 12 or whatever it was.”</text>
            <text syncTime="843.669" offset="3478026">No such testimony was forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.335" offset="3496730">So I think -- it is logical to conclude especially from the fact that they obtained these pictures from the sister and on the same day bring them to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.155" offset="3531943">And they showed what most witnesses say five or six pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.355" offset="3548766">So, it's logical that these were the pictures they got from the sister, brought it over the bank and showed it to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.036" offset="3691499">One witness as was pointed out did say that there were -- could have been 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.255" offset="3708426">But as I have tried to point out that I believe that because of what the other witnesses said and the circumstances of bringing them right from the bank that it's likely that five or six were used and that they were all of Simmons or Andrews.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.086" offset="3759731">Now, some witnesses said that in the follow-up interviews when they showed the pictures, the number of pictures increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.152" offset="3799960">And still, we have occasions where as Mrs. Parlamen said that the day she was subpoenaed, she was shown seven pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.440" offset="3833083">Four of them were of the petitioner, Simmons and three of them were now of the petitioner Garrett.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.616" offset="3869863">Also, a witness who testified that she saw the pictures the day before the trial said that there were four pictures and two of them were of Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.412" offset="3909047">Now, the last phase of this is that at the day of the trial, at the time of the trial, before the jury was picked, three or four witnesses in the accompaniment of the agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were on the back of the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.143" offset="3991907">The only ones who were in the courtroom were the defendants and they saw the petitioner, Simmons at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.574" offset="4013641">Now, as far as the initial showing, there are three other factors that show the possibility of suggestion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.618" offset="4049795">The first is that the witnesses all viewed the pictures in the bank in the same room as Mr. Misaika said in the front part of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.567" offset="4085635">Now, it is true that they did not all huddle around and identified the pictures together but they were called up separately but Mr. Misaika did testify that at the time he identified the pictures in the bank, the two other tellers were right near him towards the front of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.985" offset="4159300">So the possibility of -- especially if a small number of pictures are shown that the other two who have identified it, well, these must be the men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.013" offset="4191378">Now, there are also indications that the various bank tellers talked over the facts of the case to such an extent that Mr. Misaika, for instance, admitted that he told the FBI things that he actually hadn't seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.615" offset="4249788">What a certain man did, what Garrett was supposed to have done, he testified to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.313" offset="4268596">I mean, he made a statement to that but actually he hadn't seen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.609" offset="4281762">And the third thing is, and last, is that though it is correct as the Government has indicated that Mr. Misaika did testify that Simmons had a southern accent on direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.951" offset="4339127">In cross-examination, he -- it was brought out that in his statement to the FBI, he said that Simmons had a Tennessee accent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.373" offset="4376848">When he was interrogated as to how he knew that it was a Tennessee accent, he said, “Well, I spent a couple of years in Alabama and South Carolina and the people from Tennessee speak faster.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.186" offset="4432123">And this is about the only basis that he had for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.962" offset="4447169">Now, it should be noted that at the time he made this statement, the FBI knew that Simmons was living in Pulaski, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.139" offset="4491891">So, under all these circumstances, the possibility and the likelihood of suggestion in this case with the use of the multiple photographs particularly of Simmons and also the limitation of the number of people in the lineup.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.436" offset="4717066">No, it doesn't concede that but it concedes the factual situation involved of the use -- the multiple use of the pictures Your Honor and it really doesn't answer this in any way or try to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.279" offset="4768475">All it says is that well, Andrews was a prime suspect and he wasn't identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.384" offset="4792926">However, he might have been a prime suspect at the beginning of the case but -- Simmons was the one that they used the three or four pictures on and he was the one that they focused on at the time of the critical time of the identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.255" offset="4852381">Now, all these means is that there were two men in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.514" offset="4861471">One was small and dark and the other was tall and lean and that the witnesses considering the four pictures of Simmons involved thought that Simmons resembled the man, the tall, thin man more than Andrews.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.495" offset="4913403">However, they did look alike enough so that one witness identified Andrews in the courtroom and then later changed her testimony to the fact that it was Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.607" offset="4961782">Now, all other witnesses in the case actually tie up Simmons -- Andrews much more to the case than tie Andrews up to the case much more than Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.752" offset="5006399">It was Simmons -- Andrews who picked up the car before and after and delivered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.149" offset="5023953">It was Andrews who was seen with Garrett before the bank robbery and was seen coming with him after the bank robbery and not Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.307" offset="5068570">So the real possibility exists that because of this focusing on Simmons, the wrong man might have been identified and that it could actually have been Andrews involved in the bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.443" offset="5121128">The last part of the argument on this point by the Government is that they mentioned certain commentators who have said that evils -- have listed 12 evils that exist in pretrial identification and that out of these 12 only one exists in the Simmons case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.190" offset="5200123">Well, I'd also like to point out that same one the short period of time that the witness sees the accused during the crime is the only one present in Stovall versus Denno too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.440" offset="5257174">So, the commentators apparently did not conceive that the FBI situation here were to use some multiple ictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.837" offset="5298761">Now, the second point is that -- I will go on to the third point, Your Honor in answer to your question then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.663" offset="5342020">We have here the issue presented by the petitioner Garrett that the trial court erred in allowing his statement in support of his motion to suppress to be used by the Government in its case in chief to prove ownership of certain damaging evidence that was seized from the home of Andrews' mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.609" offset="5477857">Now, the Government was going to introduce this evidence, these money wrappers from the bank and other incriminating evidence, and during the course of the trial, the petitioner, Garrett made a motion to suppress this evidence and in support thereof testified that the suitcase and the contents of that suitcase were his.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.514" offset="5585377">Over the objection of both Simmons and Garrett, the Government was allowed to introduce into evidence the testimony of Garrett in support of his motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.606" offset="5645772">Now, the cases -- it is the position of the petitioner Garrett here that he was on the horns of a dilemma, he was forced to sacrifice under the Court's ruling his rights under the Fifth Amendment in order to enforce his rights under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.109" offset="5727796">Now, the Government's cited cases and the reasoning of the Government and the cases that they have cited is basically this, and here is I think the most important factor here -- is that just like any -- this is a situation just like any other trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.007" offset="5791431">A defendant doesn't have to take the stand and if he does take the stand, he is responsible for his acts and they can be later used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.164" offset="5828002">Well, I don't believe that is the situation that should be applied in a motion to suppress because in the trial of an ordinary case, the defendant has absolutely no burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.246" offset="5884322">He has the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.290" offset="5896547">The Government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.700" offset="5914206">The defendant need to present no evidence, it can just rely on the insufficiency of the evidence of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.199" offset="5944195">But this is not the case on a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.808" offset="5962585">He has the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.909" offset="5971048">The defendant does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.291" offset="5976586">He must show that this evidence was obtained improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.053" offset="6019636">And therefore, and under those circumstances, he really is, unlike a trial of the ordinary case, really is on the horns of a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.962" offset="6063208">And it shouldn't be a gamble situation in the United States District Court that if we are successful then we can have this -- they can never use our statement against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.601" offset="6121827">It should be that he -- this statement that he makes in support of his motion to suppress cannot be used against him whether his motion to suppress is successful or not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="1829.607" offset="7421785">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.946" offset="7435160">Although this case is here under a single docket number, it is essentially two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.835" offset="7466715">The question about the photographs relates to the petitioner, Simmons only and I believe that the question about the testimony on the motion to suppress relates to the petitioner, Garrett only, because it was only admitted against him and referred to him only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.235" offset="7568280">Now, with respect to the question about the photographs, I think the issues can be narrowed somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.707" offset="7606209">No question is raised under the Sixth Amendment that is with respect to the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.623" offset="7641840">Thus, the Wade decision itself is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.020" offset="7667440">Moreover, the trial occurred before June 12, 1967 and thus under the Stovall case, the Wade decision would not be applicable in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.969" offset="7727208">That means that the sole question here must be under the Fifth Amendment or under such a general oversight as this Court has with respect to the conduct of criminal cases in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.768" offset="7818428">As far as the Fifth Amendment is concerned, it would seem to me, I must confess, I find it a little hard to get my fingers on just what the issue, what the complaint is here with respect to the Fifth Amendment but it would have seem to me that this case is a fortiori from the Stovall case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.224" offset="7908289">If the circumstances in that case where that the potential defendant was brought before the witness manacled, did not violate due process as this Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.814" offset="7974640">It seems to me that there is no violation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.727" offset="7994284">There was nothing essentially unfair in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.220" offset="8012257">Indeed, in the Wade opinion itself, the Court referred to a number of circumstances which might remove the taint from an improper lineup and referred to the identification by picture of the defendant prior to the lineup as one of those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.164" offset="8108074">Here, the pictures were used before the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.615" offset="8129808">They were it seems to me the consequence of a good police work.Because of the white Thunderbird automobile with a long scratch on its side, the police were led to Mrs. Mahon's home where her son, Andrews either lived or was known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.753" offset="8226356">They went there and gt pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.052" offset="8239626">They took the pictures to the employees in the bank the same afternoon as the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.892" offset="8266898">And let me point out that one of the reasons for bringing in pictures is not merely to focus attention on a particular accused but is also to eliminate persons from being accused and in order to make more efficient the activity of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.688" offset="8350072">These pictures were used before the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.199" offset="8360208">They were the ordinary and natural vehicle of a good police work under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.061" offset="8387584">There were here no prior denials of identity or failures to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.967" offset="8423215">The witnesses had good opportunities to see the defendants over an appreciable period of time at the bank during a holdup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.847" offset="8462712">The persons who carried out the hold up were not masked or disguised in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.212" offset="8488208">The several witnesses all independently agreed on the identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.792" offset="8510568">As a matter of fact, they did not identify the prime suspect and agreed on that namely, Andrews.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.839" offset="8538676">Andrews was never identified from the photographs although photographs of Andrews were shown to the --</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.626" offset="8645883">Most of the witnesses seem to agree that there were five or six photographs although one of them on page 30 of the records says 20 and one of them on page 25 of the records says 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.911" offset="8710980">It is also clear that there were more than one photograph each of both Simmons and of Andrews and it also appears that some of these photographs were group photographs in which Simmons or Andrews or maybe both of them appeared with other people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.541" offset="8813484">No, it does not appear that any of them were but let me point out again that this was on the afternoon of the holdup and when the pictures are obtained, these were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.037" offset="8871476">Naturally, a police officer would take them to the persons who had witnessed the -- who had been present at the holdup to see whether they were on a likely track.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.624" offset="8933857">Incidentally, there is also here no suggestion of any improper motives such as ranker or revenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.091" offset="8975757">The prosecution didn't bring the pictures into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.333" offset="8992684">They were referred to by counsel for the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.316" offset="9008671">The witnesses identified the defendants at the trial and were fully subject to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.790" offset="9042526">In our view, the weight to be given to their testimony was for the jury to weigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.321" offset="9080665">Now, the chief reference to the pictures at the trial was not in terms of the Fifth Amendment, indeed there's -- I believe it is entirely accurate to say that there is no reference certainly in the printed record to the Fifth Amendment or to due process with respect to the use of the pictures in any way at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.741" offset="9182333">The reference to the pictures at the trial was entirely in terms of the so-called Jencks Act, which is set out on page 2 of the Government's brief in this case and which requires the United States to produce any statement as here and after defined of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.593" offset="9305736">And the term ‘statement' is defined in the statute at the bottom of page 2 to mean ‘a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him or a stenographic, mechanical, electrical or recording or a transcription which is substantially a verbatim recital of an oral statement and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.702" offset="9434154">Now, it is quite apparent that these photographs were in no sense any part of a statement prepared by these witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2370.805" offset="9586604">I have no doubt that the Court in this case could if it had thought it appropriate have required the production of the pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.688" offset="9622131">The Court -- certainly, no effort was made to have them produced apart from the Jencks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.586" offset="9653687">The reference throughout the trial is to I want them under 3500 which is the Jencks supervision and the Court specifically found on page 54 of the record that the pictures were no part of the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.863" offset="9710843">Incidentally, the statements were given on February 27th, the day of the robbery and the witnesses didn't see the pictures until the following day, February 28th, so it is entirely obvious that the pictures are no part of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.351" offset="9796733">It is equally clear to me that the Court could have required the production of the pictures had there been any reason in the record to indicate that this was really relevant or bore on the fairness of the identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.612" offset="9869772">Here, the Court did not order the production of the pictures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2734.439" offset="11041102">The fact that the testimony which Garrett gave on his motion to suppress the evidence was later introduced at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.818" offset="11094601">This was a testimony to the effect that the contents of one of the suitcases were his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.637" offset="11141935">I would like to present first what I would call the direct argument which is that in a matter like this, the defense is put to its choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.356" offset="11196792">This has been the traditional rule even in cases where possession alone is enough to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.321" offset="11236707">It has been followed in a considerable number of cases in the lower federal courts including a well-known decision by Judge Learned Hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.794" offset="11282578">In Jones against the United States and 362 U.S., this Court recognized these decisions but founded unnecessary to pass on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.597" offset="11337749">Since in that case it held that the defendant as an invitee or licensee of the premises had standing to raise the question of the validity of a search warrant which the Court then went on to hold was a validly issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.203" offset="11432208">On the basis of those cases, the defendant can decide whether he will take the stand or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.878" offset="11466898">The pressure is not put on him by the Government but by the force of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.286" offset="11500544">He is not compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.419" offset="11513083">If he does not testify nothing can be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.010" offset="11535444">On the other hand, if he chooses to testify in open court under the advice of counsel then the evidence so produced is available as testimony in open court under the advice of counsel ordinarily is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.778" offset="11614438">But in this case, it seems to me there is a stronger reason for accepting the evidence which is that the claim under the Fourth Amendment was wholly without basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.143" offset="11671907">Here, the search was of premises in which the defendant had no interest whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.797" offset="11698552">He never claimed that he had any interest in the premises and the evidence of the owner of the premises is unequivocal that he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.178" offset="11736064">This appears twice in the record on page 21 and on page 61.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.121" offset="11767829">Moreover, the search was consented to by the owner of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.386" offset="11792906">This was the testimony of the FBI agent which the Court accepted in ruling on the motion to suppress and Mrs. Mahon “led the search”, he testified.</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.806" offset="12770617">There's nothing there that says that evidence which was not compelled cannot be used just because the defendant deliberately chose to give it for his own advantage.</text>
