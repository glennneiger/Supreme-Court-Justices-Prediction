            <text syncTime="27.163" offset="213013">State versus Terry comes to this court by virtue of a writ of certiorari granted to the Ohio State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.534" offset="246554">This case originally arose in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County, based upon the indictment for carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of Ohio Revised Code, Section 2923.01.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.394" offset="309979">The defendant in this case filed a motion to suppress the evidence, and at the trial there was a hearing on the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.546" offset="338610">After hearing the motion, the motion was overruled and the case proceeded to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.761" offset="359403">This was a bench trial, jury having been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.081" offset="372673">After hearing the evidence, the motion originally filed was overruled again.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.596" offset="394825">The defendant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.232" offset="409349">The trial court ruled an opinion in this case, and we then appealed to the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.413" offset="442055">This court sustained and affirmed the conviction of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.802" offset="463579">This court also wrote an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.619" offset="474864">Subsequently, application was made to the Ohio State Supreme Court for review, and that court dismissed the application for review stating: no debatable constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.822" offset="539648">This court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.358" offset="557829">The facts in this case are these and I think they are signally important, if we are to try to arrive at the proper verdict, with reference to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.182" offset="605163">This incident occurred at 2:30 in the afternoon, in broad daylight in the downtown section of Cleveland, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.106" offset="644869">The police officer in this case, one Martin McFadden, noticed two Negro males standing at the corner of Fourteenth Street, in the City of Cleveland, where Euclid Avenue and Huron Road intersect.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.609" offset="702861">These two streets, if the court please, form a triangle at the apex of East Fourteenth Street -- the police officer was approximately 100 feet away from where these two men were.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.083" offset="876732">The police officer stated that he positioned himself in the doorway of a department store by the name of Rogauffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.352" offset="909855">For a period of 10 to 12 minutes, he observed these two males at the corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.457" offset="934201">Alternately, each made five or six trips over to two stores located on Huron Road.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.545" offset="970564">He said that he didn't know whether it was the United Airlines Store, or the Diamond Store, but the stores were immediately adjacent to one another on Huron Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.477" offset="1010270">During these five trips that they made during the 10 or 12 minute period, a third male came by, white male who stood and talked with the two males for a moment or so and then the other male proceeded west, on Euclid Avenue, and the two males continued on this corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.053" offset="1092608">After the 10 to 12 minute period, the two men then walked west on Euclid Avenue, some several hundred feet down Euclid Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.147" offset="1140987">When they arrived at Zucker's Store, which is in the vicinity of 9th Street, or 11th Street, there on Euclid Avenue, the three males then again met up, at which time the three of them, according to the police officer's testimony, merely standing in front of Zucker's Store --</text>

            <text syncTime="283.688" offset="1239103">His testimony was that their backs were to the plate glass windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.804" offset="1255612">They were facing the street, and when interrogated with reference to what they were doing, he said they were merely standing there talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.464" offset="1290303">He described their gate away from Fourteenth Street as they walked down to the haberdashery as a normal walk, nothing unusual about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.843" offset="1331785">The police officer then says, I then went over to the three men.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.440" offset="1350175">I said to them, I'm a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.132" offset="1360938">What are your names?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.015" offset="1368461">In the first instance, he said, they gave it to me quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.084" offset="1384761">In all other places in the record, he says, They mumbled something.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.916" offset="1404092">He said, at this, I then reached out and got Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.101" offset="1420810">I spun him around, holding him in front of me.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.571" offset="1438678">I then began to pat him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.604" offset="1450799">Once he had patted, patted this man down, he says: I felt inside of his top coat what felt to be the handle of a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.042" offset="1488520">I then reached inside the coat and tried to remove the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.585" offset="1506701">I could not remove the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.346" offset="1513806">I therefore took the entire coat off of him and then took the gun out of the coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.260" offset="1541392">At this point, he says, I ordered the three of them into the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.962" offset="1560200">As I walked through the doorway, I said to the store personnel, ‘Order the wagon.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.591" offset="1586740">He later explained that ordering the wagon means you are then under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.938" offset="1608161">Once inside the store, the three men were ordered up against the wall, whereupon he then searched Chilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.081" offset="1644732">Inside of Chilton's top coat, he also found a loaded revolver.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.663" offset="1667093">He searched the third male, Katz, upon whom he found nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.397" offset="1689976">He then calls these men to be removed from the haberdashery to the Cleveland's Police Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.960" offset="1716203">When they arrived at the police station, they were then booked for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.664" offset="1743057">Some time late the next day, after having been interrogated the following morning, these men were then charged, officially late the second day, with carrying concealed weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.380" offset="1797914">The police officer testified further with reference to questions propounded to him having to bear on the question of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.654" offset="1835008">We asked him, did you know any of these men?</text>

            <text syncTime="437.284" offset="1885059">Had you ever seen any of these men previously?</text>
            <text syncTime="441.303" offset="1884954">Had anyone given you any information regarding them?</text>
            <text syncTime="447.836" offset="1895717">He was then asked what had attracted his attention to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.083" offset="1908778">He said, Well, to tell you the truth, I didn't like them.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.454" offset="2142208">The court specifically asked him if he had, during his 39 years as a police officer ever previously observed any one casing a place.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.907" offset="2184004">He said, No, he had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.732" offset="2191318">Asked if he had arrested anyone for casing a place, in his 39 years, he said that he had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.325" offset="2245653">We should like to make reference, just briefly to the decision of the lower court in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.631" offset="2278881">Our court held, in that opinion, that there is no evidence that any warrant had been issued for a search or frisk, and I am not going to stress the facts and state that there was a lawful arrest prior to the frisk of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.219" offset="2341261">I believe it would be stretching the facts beyond reasonable comprehension, and foolhardy, to say there was an unlawful arrest because there wasn't from the facts as presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.835" offset="2387759">Later, in the same opinion, our trial court said, I believe, and I reiterate again, that search and seizure laws cannot be applied to this particular situation, although Mr. Reuben Payne endeavored to show there was a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.210" offset="2457245">But the court cannot agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.694" offset="2467171">If there was an arrest, it came subsequent to the frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.364" offset="2489846">The court then based its decision upon Ker versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.798" offset="2511579">The court said that the Ker decision did not preclude the states from developing workable rules in order to bring about effective law enforcement in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.102" offset="2564765">The court said, with reference to the acquisition of the gun, that the gun was the fruit of the frisk and that probable cause arose once the police officer had frisked, found the gun; he then had the probable cause to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.318" offset="2657656">Our Court of Appeals, in affirming the decision, stated that, a policeman may, under appropriate circumstances, reasonably inquire of a person concerning his suspicious on-the-street behavior, in the absence of reasonable grounds to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.421" offset="2734038">Our court admitted that in all probability this would lead to abuses by the police, but then went on to say that, the court would deal with the abuses as they arose before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.426" offset="2790149">The court stated, further, that this of course was just a minor inconvenience with the personal liberty that is guaranteed, and that therefore each citizen ought to be willing to give up this amount of his personal liberty in order that they might have effective law enforcement in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.321" offset="2873637">Our court offered this definition of arrest, that as the term is used in criminal law, it signifies the apprehension or detention of the person of another in order that he may be forthcoming to answer an alleged or supposed crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.357" offset="2941868">They distinguished Henry versus U.S. by saying that in that case the government had made a concession, and therefore when this court rendered Henry that it was rendering it on the unique situation where the government had come in and conceded that at the time the automobile was stopped, the arrest had occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1403.717" offset="5719312">He did see what one might well say were suspicious acts on the part of the people whom he thought might be preparing to commit a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.959" offset="5856193">Now, because of the nature of the crime that he suspected, a robbery, he felt that when he went into the company of these three men, against himself alone, that he was in a dangerous position; and, that, therefore, he had probable cause to see if they had weapons on them, not because he had probable cause to believe they had committed a crime, but because in investigative matters he had probable cause to believe that his life was in danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.511" offset="6034453">Under those circumstances, would you think that he did, or did not have a right to ascertain whether he was in a position of danger, by seeing if they had weapons?</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.591" offset="7170779">Now they're saying to this court, give us another standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.625" offset="7650910">There it is indicated that after the officer had testified that he observed the conduct of these men, and that he had concluded that they were casing an establishment for a robbery, we find this quote appearing from the record, Question: Detective McFadden, can you tell us why you turned John Terry around facing the other two men, with you behind him?</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.716" offset="7763237">Answer: Due to my observation, the observation on Huron Road of these two men, I felt as though they were going to pull a stick-up and they may have a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.802" offset="7819557">That is supported and substantiated in the record of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.660" offset="7851008">A question has been asked here, what is the difference between reasonable suspicion, and probable cause?</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.824" offset="7895730">In one instance, in the arguments of the case before this court, the Court of Appeals in the Peters case, has said, it is that cause which is somewhat below probable cause on the scale of absolute knowledge of criminal activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.796" offset="13243622">At that point, there can be no doubt about an arrest, I guess.</text>

            <label>Mr. Reuben M. Payne</label>
            <text syncTime="3287.579" offset="13254698">I would agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.408" offset="13262012">I think that the affirmance of the conviction of the petitioners on the law in the instant case is reasonable, is necessary, and is appropriate to secure the safety and the welfare and the best interest of the public of the State of Ohio, because we are asking here -- and I am, perhaps, bound to indicate that the Court of Appeals has suggested in this particular case -- that we authorize the stopping under these circumstances where there are these surrounding circumstances, for the protection of the officer's life and for the protection to the community that will exist if this is not permitted in this manner and this way, depending upon the circumstances that exist at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.128" offset="13496905">The means that is selected, as enunciated by our trial court and the Court of Appeals in this case, have a direct substantial relationship to the concept of the safety and the welfare sought to be attained in the affirmance of this particular case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.275" offset="13581542">If we consider the comments of the trial judge at the time that he gave his opinion in connection with this matter, the trial judge made these remarks: I am a great believer of the personal rights propounded by our Supreme Court, reiterated and reaffirmed, neglected over the years and given to us under the Fourth Amendment and other amendments of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.717" offset="13699302">Secondly, the trial court said, At the same time, a police officer cannot, as far as this Court is concerned, and will not be permitted to stop and frisk an individual simply because he has a suspicion -- a mere suspicion -- unless there are reasonable circumstances justifying the frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.756" offset="13787387">Three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.790" offset="13791566">When the circumstances justify, and there is reasonable suspicion, and for his own personal protection, he may frisk to determine if there are weapons for his personal safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.729" offset="13839318">Four.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.731" offset="13843289">The officer assigned in the area in which he had been placed, doing the job he had been doing, and had reasonable cause to believe and to suspect that the defendants were conducting themselves suspiciously and some interrogation should be made of their action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.790" offset="13907550">Five.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.750" offset="13911416">There was reasonable cause in this case for the officer to approach these individuals and pat them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.936" offset="13936180">Here is a decided attempt on the part of the trial judge to equate and balance the rights of the individuals with the rights of the public and the safety that is involved herein as it pertains to the officer in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.125" offset="14000859">What are the reasonable cause -- circumstances that existed in the mind of the officer at that particular time?</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.415" offset="14034087">One, we have a police officer in his particular area, on duty, and his duty is to maintain law and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.471" offset="14070241">His duty, too, is to prevent crime if he can so do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.280" offset="14085496">Secondly, he has 39 years of experience herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.303" offset="14101588">Fourth, the observations of the suspicious activity which he observed, which may be determined as pre-detention conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.272" offset="14133457">Five, he concludes from the observations and the conduct of these men that a crime of violence with the use of weapons in probability may be committed under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.709" offset="14195210">Sixth, he decides to investigate and to interrogate, and the record indicates and shows that at this particular time, why did you go over to these men?</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.933" offset="14232095">I went over to them to ask them some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.546" offset="14250590">Eight, when he asked their names, he received this mumbled incoherent response, which further gave rise to the circumstances that he had concluded previously that a stick-up was possible here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.122" offset="14312866">At this point, taking into consideration the nature of the crime which he has concluded -- a stick-up -- and the use of weapons as they are characteristically used in a stick-up, there is only one course of conduct then open to a prudent police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.497" offset="14390397">And that is, to frisk or pat for weapons, for the protection of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.778" offset="14415475">This is why we considered it in the interest of safety and public welfare in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.169" offset="14441075">Seven -- or, not seven, but -- ten, there was the absence of assistance to this officer, at this time, in relation to the number of individuals involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.825" offset="14483707">There was one police officer and three men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.218" offset="14501261">The type of clothing, also, he considered at this particular time because they were wearing overcoats, and the possibility that they might have concealed weapons, as they did exist here; the sex of the subjects, also, I think he had to take into consideration, at this particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.467" offset="14562283">There were three agile, young men that he was confronting, and he was by himself at this particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.235" offset="14593317">Under these circumstances that he was confronted with at this time, I believe that it was in the interest of public safety; I believe it is in the interest of the welfare of the community and society, that he have the right, based on these probable cause circumstances, to frisk this man, to temporarily detain him, to ascertain that which he has observed, and to confiscate any weapons which he may find on his person at that particular time; and, that they are admissible in the evidence of his trial subsequent thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.890" offset="14756007">I think that if, as the question was placed by one of the justices of the court, that after the probable cause that exists here in this particular case, I feel that the judgment in the case should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3712.669" offset="14955060">These men have gone down Euclid Avenue, where Huron Avenue cannot even be seen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3731.973" offset="15032278">We would ask this Court to be mindful, also, of the fact that if this Court does affirm this decision, it will, in effect, be affirming the decision rendered by the Court of Appeals, in which they have established the fruit-of-the-frisk doctrine for the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.602" offset="15106779">I would ask you to keep in mind that the State of Ohio's legislature has just considered, a few months ago, and rejected a stop-and-frisk bill similar to that of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.939" offset="15156203">Lastly, we would ask you to consider that in accordance with decisions such as DeRay, where this Court has said a search is either good or bad when it starts, and it does not change character thereafter; and, that the after-the-event justification does not relate back to justify the original, initial unlawful search.</text>
