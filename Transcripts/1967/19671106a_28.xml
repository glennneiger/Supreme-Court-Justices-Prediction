            <label>Mr. Avram G. Adler</label>
            <text syncTime="24.617" offset="201853">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.747" offset="210317">Mr. Chief Justice and justices of the Supreme Court, this is a case involving two very important issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.901" offset="266951">First, the scope and orbit of the declara -- the federal declaratory judgment action and two, the reach and scope of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 and its subsequent clarification in the new rule of 19 as it went into effect on July 1st, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.626" offset="389831">The facts of this case are not in dispute and are fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.301" offset="416580">An automobile driven by an individual by the name of Cionci traveling at high speed across the median strip and struck a vehicle operated by Thomas Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.807" offset="458585">The Cionci vehicle had as passengers the Lynch and John L. Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.352" offset="496828">Cionci, Smith and Lynch were all killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.394" offset="532982">Cionci was without any assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.936" offset="559104">Cionci and Lynch had borrowed the car from one Dutcher, who was the name assured of an insurance policy issued by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company, who I shall call Lumbermens here after.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.671" offset="634023">The primary issues as to whether coverage was to be accorded Cionci was one whether -- there was no question that consent had been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.079" offset="691702">The only question was whether the geographical orbit of the consent has been exceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.965" offset="719182">In as much as -- there was some question originally as to whether Cionci was the driver, this is now but admitted and is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.922" offset="751052">The declaratory judgment action was originally brought on the two bases as to determine that Cionci was the driver and to determine the coverage of the insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.611" offset="809775">A suit was brought in the United States District Court in -- for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by the Provident Tradesmen and Trust Company as administrators of the estate of Lynch against the estate of Cionci.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.428" offset="877066">Lumbermens did not defend that equal judgment was entered, the issue was subsequently settled, and the settlement was approved at which point Lumbermens did enter into the hearing and the judgment now exist for $50,000 for the estate of Lynch against the estate of Cionci.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.455" offset="973197">In addition, actions were brought in Delaware County which is a county contiguous to Philadelphia by the estate of Smith and John L. Harris who was not killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.648" offset="1029935">Those actions have never gotten beyond the pleading stage even though in those actions Dutcher is represented by counsel furnished to him by the insurer, Lumbermens.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.604" offset="1093778">The -- a declaratory judgment action was then brought by Provident Tradesmen Bank and Trust Company to determine whether or not Cionci was insured under the permissive use clause of the insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.680" offset="1134111">This was important because without the coverage actions against Cionci would be a mere academic exercise and just would be no funds, Cionci is dead and there were no assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.822" offset="1178624">Lumbermens then moved to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party naming John L. Harris and the estate of Thomas W. Smith as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.826" offset="1230660">The actions were then amended to bring them in and the action went -- then went forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.846" offset="1258768">At no point thereafter was any motions made or the issue raised as to Dutcher being an indispensable party until the Court of Appeals raised it sua sponte at the argument after the case had gone to verdict and during argument on other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.247" offset="1344345">At the trial, the question of the interest of Dutcher came up under the Pennsylvanian so-called Dead Man's Rule which has -- Justice Goodrich reviews in detail in Wright versus Wilson is a holdover from the old vouch -- the old concept that a man who had some interest or no matter how remote or contingent was being nabbed to be able to tell the truth in a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.127" offset="1459911">We still preserve the Pennsylvania Dead Man's Rule and during the brief -- the colloquies preceding their trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.181" offset="1492093">It was contended by counsel for the estate of Lynch that Dutcher had such an interest as would make him incompetent under the Pennsylvania Dead Man's Rule and it was contended by Lumbermen that he did not had such an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.371" offset="1560848">The lower court ruled that Dutcher was incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.390" offset="1588955">I should explain in this case, at this prosecuted case despite the fact that there had been an attempts made at pretrial procedure to determine the amount of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.537" offset="1625527">This was resisted by Lumbermens and we had to deal with philosophical concepts rather than the actual amount so that we -- that's why the Court's make allusions to finite limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.796" offset="1670562">It was contended that the interest of Dutcher was such as to render him incompetent under the Dead Man's Rule because they're being finite limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.665" offset="1710059">Dutcher being a party defendant to the actions in the Delaware County that this would influence his decision such as to make him incompetent under the Pennsylvania Dead Man's Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.216" offset="1752273">And of course it was contended by Lumbermens to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.272" offset="1776410">The action with -- Dutcher did testify at the trial because as to Harris he was not incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.048" offset="1811519">The jury rendered a verdict in that Cionci was operating the automobile within the geographical scope of permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.742" offset="1846314">It found Dutcher's testimony not credible as to the Court in the -- in ruling on the post trial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.421" offset="1877034">There was a directed verdict for the estate of Lynch and the estate of Smith in as much as the Pennsylvania rule, there is a presumption that the driver of the vehicle, the driving with this permission of the owner and there was no testimony for the contrary as to those estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.673" offset="1958013">When the case came on to the Court of Appeals, the issue of indispensable party having been raised sua sponte the Court then did not rule for some 18 months and then had reargued and subsequently rendered the decisions which had brought us into the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.504" offset="2045367">The majority opinion if I may characterize it, have it so briefly is that the Dutcher is an indispensable party in as much as his interest will be effected in as much as he is a defendant in the Delaware County cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.189" offset="2112136">(Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="avram_g_adler" startTime="503.566" stopTime="1262.453">
            <label>Mr. Avram G. Adler</label>
            <text syncTime="503.566" offset="2117674">And they stopped right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.954" offset="2135228">They did not make any further inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.105" offset="2147767">They didn't follow the purport of the new trends as to Rule 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.410" offset="2184965">I won't propose in this short time to trace the history of the indispensable party concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.954" offset="2211192">This was done brilliantly by Professor Reid and Professor (Inaudible), it was originally a doctrine born in equity in which equity would withhold its grace from -- unless all the parties were before it unless it could do substantial or total justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.498" offset="2293321">However, this concept when he transmigrated into the legal side of the Court then became a tool of legal oppression rather than of help.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.456" offset="2341177">And as a result of the Article of Greed and Hazard, a tentative rule was proposed and circulated to setup various criteria if the Court should consider under Rule 19 before a case was dismissed under the indispensable party concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.302" offset="2416619">A research instructor at Harvard by the name of Fink (ph) then wrote a contrary article saying that the indispensable party concept was one of substantive law and beyond the reach of the federal rules of civil procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.440" offset="2485164">These articles were all before the committee which tool the new Rule 19 and in an unusually lengthy notes and comments in the new Rule 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.377" offset="2532916">It is clear that they rejected the concept, I think, advance the arguments of greed and hazard and set forth minimum criteria which should have been followed by a Court before dismissing under the indispensable party concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.043" offset="2587564">It is the complaint of the petitioner here that the Court of Appeals in the majority opinion did not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.879" offset="2622882">And if I may just examine the various criteria by which they could have say this judgment and it is a difficult case.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.757" offset="2674395">It was a case that previous inquiries have been done and the issue of coverage is crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.585" offset="2701667">The new Rule 19 says the first factor is what does judgment bring -- to mean to the absentee, Dutcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.085" offset="2743672">If anything, it is clearly to his advantage because he gets a second -- if we accept the fact that he has an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.987" offset="2799365">He gets a second opportunity in as much as he's not bound by the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.922" offset="2835101">But had the judgment been adverse to the petitioner then we would have been bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.535" offset="2857462">Dutcher in this action had everything to gain and nothing to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.970" offset="2875225">If he won, these foreclosed the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.580" offset="2893720">If he lost, he still had a second opportunity and this of course was fully cognizant -- fully aware -- was within the contemplation of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.271" offset="2956413">The second pragmatic factor and the rule maker -- the committee who fashioned the rule used the word pragmatic repeatedly and it is not as that respondent says in it's a brief, a conclusionary fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.282" offset="3020466">It is a seeking fact, it is an initial fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.385" offset="3036871">It is the -- what is good and best for the parties, all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.709" offset="3066232">The second pragmatic factor is highly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.251" offset="3080338">The interest of Dutcher was highly remote and contingent and therefore the Court could have and should have shaped the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.500" offset="3149406">They could have very easily conditioned the judgment by merely saying, we will affirm the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.102" offset="3175737">We will not find Dutcher an indispensable party.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.384" offset="3188903">We won't even consider it if the parties here agree to limit their claims against all defendants, Dutcher or Cionci to the policy limits which have now been admitted to be $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.808" offset="3258598">Had this been done this case would've stopped right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.931" offset="3279078">I -- as I have said in my brief, I am authorized and I have been authorized to do just that and accept such a conditional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.140" offset="3315963">And then we don't have -- I have to consider the interest of Dutcher one bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.311" offset="3336652">Yet, this was never afforded the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.995" offset="3355355">The interest of Dutcher never had to arise to the dignity of an indispensable party concept had the Court merely followed the second pragmatic factor which new Rule 19 sets forth as minimum criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.842" offset="3418781">I'd like at this point -- because it's mentioned in the respondent's brief, to explain the inconsistencies if such there be and I hope to show that there is not between claiming the interest of Dutcher so as to preclude him from testifying under the Pennsylvania Dead Man's Rule and arguing here that is in -- in his interest is remote and contingent.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.764" offset="3518464">Under Pennsylvania law, remoteness and contingency as long as the interest is pecuniary and adverse does not preclude him from being found incompetent under the Pennsylvania Dead Man's Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.848" offset="3570813">The best case to cite that is and I've chosen an extreme case is Alcorn versus Cook which is cited in the brief, where the husband of a legatee without any showing that she might not be able -- that there might not be sufficient funds was precluded from testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.167" offset="3640090">Not only was there a remoteness and contingency as to whether there would be sufficient funds for the legatee.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.487" offset="3665272">But there was remoteness as to the husband's interest because he would have to survive the wife in order to have his interest brought into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.240" offset="3700381">Nevertheless the -- under Pennsylvania law the husband was found incompetent to testify under the Pennsylvania Dead Man's Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.918" offset="3739042">Now that's not so, where you have the indispensable party concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.411" offset="3760985">There the interest must be direct and crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.083" offset="3779688">And we submit that it's not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.638" offset="3789928">It is significant that this -- as I point out in my brief that the Delaware County cases have never gotten out of the pleading stage even after this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.182" offset="3836113">They have lain dormant there for some eight years and it is significant that counsel for Dutcher is furnished by the respondent here in Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.585" offset="3893687">They have done nothing to resolve Dutcher's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.637" offset="3905912">In their brief, they say, well, the estate of Lynch could have brought these actions to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.748" offset="3930363">This is not so as far as this petitioner is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.980" offset="3943320">The personal representative of the estate of Lynch in this action is not the defendant in the Delaware County cases as I have pointed out in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.054" offset="3987623">The plaintiffs in those cases had their own personal representative for the estate of Lynch appointed again for the purposes of reaching the insurance statute and no action was brought against the estate of Lynch as such by its actual personal representative which was Provident Tradesmen Bank and Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.428" offset="4077066">The third factor which was advanced by the advisory committee is whether an adequate judgment can be rendered in the absence of Dutcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.981" offset="4115310">We submit that it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.061" offset="4127640">The crucial issue was resolved which is the permission of Dutcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.668" offset="4154075">Dutcher testified at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.829" offset="4162644">This is not a case of someone who's -- who was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.587" offset="4177690">He came into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.830" offset="4182706">He testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.160" offset="4188035">He said, I didn't give them the necessary permission, the jury rejected his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.992" offset="4211336">The fourth factor based by the advisory committee looks to the practical effect of the dismissal and there I asked this Court to look to the minority opinion, the dissenting opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.305" offset="4264626">We have now -- this has been 8 years in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.976" offset="4279254">The issue has been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.459" offset="4289181">To trudge back again is a terrible burden, especially in the light of the fact that a judgment can be rendered which makes Dutcher's interest absolutely known which is to say, we will uphold the judgment if the plaintiffs agree to confine all their claims against both Dutcher and Cionci to the policy rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.996" offset="4411329">Dutcher then has no interest at all and has no cause to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.991" offset="4427316">The only one then who has a cause to complain is the respondent who wants a second chance to litigate this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.286" offset="4452498">They've had their day in Court and they want to litigate it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.738" offset="4474337">The Court unfortunately after finding Dutcher and then this defensible party then went on and said that the lower court abused its discretion in entertaining the declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.133" offset="4539956">It made one very crucial error in this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.066" offset="4559600">It assumed that the actions in Delaware County were the same as the actions in the federal court and this is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.150" offset="4583946">The actions in Delaware County, no state court actions were actions by the estate of Smith and living plaintiff Harris against the estate of Cionci, the estate of Lynch, and Dutcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.024" offset="4647476">The insurer, respondent is not a party to the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.702" offset="4666180">By Pennsylvania law the question of insurance can't even be brought up in those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.944" offset="4687182">There would be no inkling to the trier of fact in those actions that there was any insurance involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.183" offset="4716126">And the Court of Appeals completely overlooks the very important thing that this declaratory judgment action is not only proper but we believe it would have been a -- an abuse of discretion to refuse to entertain it because the -- a single crucial issue is here being determined which changes an academic exercise into a very real and vital thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.698" offset="4830124">And I might also point out that this declaratory judgment action also benefits Dutcher because as were shown in the action by the estate of Lynch, Lumbermens never defended that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.219" offset="4884250">If this judgment is upheld then Lumbermens will vigorously defend against the plaintiff's actions in the Delaware County case thus, limiting the -- or attempting to limit the exposure of Cionci and to preserve what is left for Dutcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.172" offset="4988008">I might point out that the case against Dutcher in the Delaware County cases based upon the record which we have here is very naked and very remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.106" offset="5023848">Dutcher handed the keys and lent the car to Cionci and Lynch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.593" offset="5041716">There's no other connection with the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.428" offset="5061047">In the defendant's brief, they has say, well, maybe the brakes were bad and there is an allegation and the complaint that brakes were bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.611" offset="5081840">But if the testimony in the court below, nothing was ever said about brakes, I don't submit however that that's a controlling issue in the light of the arguments I've made here before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.095" offset="5159790">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.384" offset="5188942">If we may consider initially the comments made by counsel with respect to the error of Judge Kalodner in the Court of Appeals, Judge Kalodner did not mistake when he said that all of these matters could be decided in Delaware County, Common Pleas Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.246" offset="5284342">Judge Kalodner is well aware of the fact that one does not try coverage actions and tort actions at the same time in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.760" offset="5322376">And I think a clear reading of his opinion indicates that what he was saying was that every single person that should be a party to this action was present in Delaware County and all of the actions could have been brought there and tried there and decided there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.092" offset="5407744">And it would not have been necessary to bring any separate declaratory judgment action either in the state court or the federal court for the simple reason that upon obtaining a verdict in the state court in the negligence action, a garnishment proceeding could immediately have been brought against the Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.295" offset="5500531">And at the rate at which matters moved in Delaware County, this whole matter would have decided about five or six years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.677" offset="5538043">If for the purpose of its own strategy the petitioner here wanted to maneuver this entire litigation in the fashion in which it has been maneuvered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.207" offset="5592168">Then it would seem essential that he should fall if -- even if it were said that he is falling on a technicality because it's of his own manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.531" offset="5641488">Now, assuming without deciding or without contending that the majority opinion would seem to indicate perhaps that the Court has gone beyond its rule making power or at least that is the way to induct minority seem to want to treat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.576" offset="5757680">It's submitted that irrespective of how one views Rule 19, this case is properly dismissed by the majority because under the most liberal interpretation of Rule 19, this case does not meet the criteria enunciated by this Court, enunciated in Rule 19 and if you will by (Inaudible) and the other scholarly writers of law review articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.173" offset="5904071">In this case, Dutcher is -- if he is -- if anything appears to Dutcher, he's deprived of 50% of the coverage he build up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.089" offset="5955688">If that's not the situation and that he is in no way bound by this judgment to which he was not a party then the Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company has a potential exposure above the amount of its policy to the extent that it has to under this decision of the -- from which the appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals would have more liability for payment of money that he never contracted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.167" offset="6088077">Because if Dutcher us not bound by the District Court judgment that which says that Lumbermens must pay 50% or $50,000 of its coverage he then can say to the Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company in the event of verdicts against him in Delaware County, you can't take any credit for that $50,000 because I wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.730" offset="6194343">I wasn't a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.786" offset="6202493">Therefore, you'll have to pay whatever you paid for Cionci and whatever above that is necessarily to satisfy any judgments against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.895" offset="6250977">Now the contention that Dutcher doesn't stand in any danger is very unrealistic because testimony can be brought in at any time that would show that there was an agency relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.477" offset="6317328">Also, testimony can be presented in the tort actions that there was something wrong with his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.649" offset="6345958">Any proofs along those lines would be consistent with the pleadings in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.819" offset="6374693">The fact that up to this time no one knows of any such witnesses isn't controlling because certainly in our trial experience, we've seen witnesses come that had never been expected long after -- all of discovery proceedings were completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.095" offset="6451702">Appear over weekends after interrogatories in the supplemental interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.260" offset="6484407">So Dutcher does have a potential liability in the Delaware County action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.836" offset="6578761">That was suggested by Judge Freeman in his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.546" offset="6601540">If the Court were to enter a -- an order tailored to this case in which it said now the Lynch's estate or Provident Tradesmen cannot execute on this judgment until Dutcher's liability is decided in the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.401" offset="6688998">It's entirely possible and likely necessary in order to protect the entire situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.124" offset="6723897">For actions to be broad in which a contrary result is sought because with Dutcher as a plaintiff in Delaware County before a jury, it's very likely that a judgment can -- a verdict and subsequent judgment can be obtained which will hold that Cionci is not entitled to coverage under Lumbermens policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.993" offset="6847300">So that -- what this Court said in the Pacific Casualty case would then be a reality and there's nothing that any decree that's entered by the Court of Appeals, there's nothing that it can do to prevent a judgment in Delaware County completely different than the judgment here with respect to the coverage owing Cionci.</text>
