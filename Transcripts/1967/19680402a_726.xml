            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 726, Robert T. Mathis, Sr., petitioner versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.138" offset="227976">Mr. Capuano?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_j_capuano" startTime="32.387" stopTime="301.294">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas J. Capuano</label>
            <text syncTime="32.387" offset="232887">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.511" offset="237380">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.379" offset="252844">Mathis was convicted of filing false income tax returns for 1960 and 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.515" offset="309478">A sentence was imposed of 30 months to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.054" offset="335600">The time on issue, I believe to be resolved here, is whether the constitutional principles as enunciated by this Court in Miranda versus Arizona are applicable to the facts in the Mathis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.341" offset="408743">At the very outset, I wish to emphasize that the petitioner's assault on his conviction does not rise or fall solely on the applicability of Miranda but also on the applicability of constitutional principles involved in cases of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.316" offset="508635">In United States versus Harrison, 265 Federal Supplement at page 666, the District Court for the Southern District of New York suppressed certain oral statements that were given to an agent of the Internal Revenue Service while the defendant was incarcerated in the Dannemora State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.014" offset="615424">Now, the facts in the Harrison case are strikingly similar to the facts in the Mathis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.695" offset="658160">In April of 1965, an indictment was returned against Harrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.106" offset="687835">In that one, charged the defendant with understating his income for the calendar years 1958 and 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.012" offset="735378">In March of 1961, while the defendant was incarcerated at Dannemora, he was interviewed by an agent of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.586" offset="785742">He was asked and he answered certain questions about his income, his assets and the filing of his returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.544" offset="825553">He was not advised of his constitutional rights prior to the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.724" offset="858258">District Judge Tyler in granting the Motion to Suppress stated although perhaps this was not a usual and typical cause to arrest situation, the interview in his opinion could not sensibly be viewed as anything but another instance of custodial interrogation, as no warnings were given by the agent to Harrison, no evidence obtained from the questioning could be used against him citing Miranda versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.150" offset="1011963">The Miranda case and the Harrison case and the Escobedo case illustrate the concern of the court regarding interrogations which are conducted in a compelling atmosphere for the setting in which they take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.574" offset="1089703">I do not believe that the constitutional safeguards should be abridged to accommodate tax investigators whose activities often conceal transformation of a civil to a criminal tax investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.775" offset="1162428">Agent Lawless of the lnternal Revenue Service candidly admitted that when he interviewed Mathis at Raiford State Prison on October 30th of 1964 and again on March 2nd of 1965, he did not advised Mathis of his constitutional rights prior to his questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.678" offset="1258036">Although there was a possibility of a criminal violation, the wording in Escobedo certainly applies to the Mathis case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="301.294" stopTime="335.157">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="301.294" offset="1308505">I suppose, the problem may be reflected in Judge Thornburg's statement on page 7 of the record, the opinion on the Fifth Circuit, where he says the evidence clearly reflects until March 10 when appellant's case -- and that was after these interviews you referred to -- the inquiry involving appellant's tax returns representing no more than a routine civil tax investigation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_j_capuano" startTime="335.157" stopTime="428.885">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas J. Capuano</label>
            <text syncTime="335.157" offset="1444028">Well, that was one way of simply dismissing it but what the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals failed to consider was the testimony of Agent Derry who was a criminal tax investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.967" offset="1503274">As early as February 6th of 1963, they became suspicious of Mathis.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.613" offset="1537860">At that time, the record will show that Sheriff Buckles of Osceola County telephoned Agent Derry and asked him to come to Kissimmee where he turned over a letter, and the two returns for one year which should have made that veteran investigator very suspicious and obviously made Sheriff Buckle suspicious, but Agent Derry explained that all he did in 1963 was put these two returns that was supposed to be filed for the same year together with this letter that allegedly was written by Mathis to his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.378" offset="1704835">He put him in his personal locked file, which to me is just unbelievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.647" offset="1729912">A veteran investigator who knows at that time that there's something wrong just puts this kind of information in a personal locked file and forgets them.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.584" offset="1773693">But of course, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did not mention that and they labeled it as a routine tax investigation.</text>

          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="428.885" stopTime="433.086">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="428.885" offset="1818937">We don't have any instructions here, do we?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_j_capuano" startTime="433.086" stopTime="454.419">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas J. Capuano</label>
            <text syncTime="433.086" offset="1835760">The jury instructions?</text>
            <text syncTime="434.505" offset="1841403">I do not believe so judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.187" offset="1852165">I was appointed by this Court and the record was made up.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.019" offset="1871496">My function of course was to file the necessary briefs but I don't believe that the jury instructions were included by the trial attorney.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="454.419" stopTime="474.470">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="454.419" offset="1921024">So the -- if we should decide that the point of law here has to be determined with reference to the formation of an intent or purpose on the part of the agents, to pursue this is a criminal matter.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_j_capuano" startTime="474.470" stopTime="475.089">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas J. Capuano</label>
            <text syncTime="474.470" offset="2001272">Yes, sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="475.089" stopTime="485.976">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="475.089" offset="2003780">We have to go to the record of the testimony itself and pierce through the statement of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.226" offset="2044322">Would you agree with that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_j_capuano" startTime="485.976" stopTime="618.566">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas J. Capuano</label>
            <text syncTime="485.976" offset="2047248">Yes, sir, absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.920" offset="2059055">But, to go on, as I said, the wording in Escobedo certainly would apply to Mathis where the Court said that the guiding hand of counsel was essential to advice the petitioner of his right in a delicate situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.154" offset="2123943">And this was the stage when legal aid and advice were most critical to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.930" offset="2147140">And what happened at the interrogation could certainly affect the whole trial since rights may be irretrievably lost if not then and there asserted which is exactly what happened in the Mathis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.559" offset="2201579">As stated in Miranda, it said, “The warning is needed in order to make him aware not only of the privilege but also of the consequences of foregoing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.373" offset="2244838">Moreover, this warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.526" offset="2293426">I take that to mean that he is in the presence of persons acting solely against his interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.683" offset="2326131">Yet, eight days later on March 10 of 1965, Agent Lawless referred this case to the Internal Revenue, Intelligence Division as involving definite indications of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.637" offset="2385899">Now I believe that for the full achievement of Miranda values, a person needs more than a sympathetic explanation before his interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.800" offset="2430621">What he needs most is a sympathetic advocate during that interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.328" offset="2456639">No one will deny that the custody which Mathis was being held in Raiford State Prison was a type during which unwitnessed or coercive methods could have been used and I do not mean to infer by any means that they were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.484" offset="2537305">But no one can also deny that Mathis was completely under the control and domination of his jailers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="618.566" stopTime="625.301">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="618.566" offset="2577638">You wouldn't be making this argument if say that he had been jailed, that he has been at home and then he called out when he's home to ask him about his tax return?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_j_capuano" startTime="625.301" stopTime="628.623">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas J. Capuano</label>
            <text syncTime="625.301" offset="2604596">Absolutely correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="628.623" stopTime="632.440">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="628.623" offset="2617866">So it's the incarceration --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_j_capuano" startTime="632.440" stopTime="660.215">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas J. Capuano</label>
            <text syncTime="632.440" offset="2633122">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.070" offset="2635630">As a practical matter, judge, let us assume that Mathis said, “I wanted a lawyer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.566" offset="2665618">There was no telephone available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.335" offset="2676694">There's no lawyers in Raiford.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.690" offset="2690173">Could he have complained to anyone that he was denied access to a lawyer or denied access to a telephone?</text>
            <text syncTime="653.128" offset="2715878">This is not the situation where you and I are sitting in our homes or in our place of business and an agent walks in --</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="675.699" offset="2806157">-- that he was in jail but (Voice Overlap) physical events that occurred at his house, there would be no problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nicholas_j_capuano" startTime="682.051" stopTime="1380.322">
            <label>Mr. Nicholas J. Capuano</label>
            <text syncTime="682.051" offset="2831548">Well, I wouldn't dismiss in the same would be no problem, but there be less problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.947" offset="2851192">Let me put it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.318" offset="2860596">I don't think that the psychological pressures of a person sitting in his home are the same as those sitting in Raiford State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.722" offset="2894242">This Court is well aware of the Bennie Brooks case which of course I won't go into but you're all familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.213" offset="2936247">The government contended that Mathis received in cash the refund check for 1960 and filed a false claim for 1961 but it's interesting to note only the 1960 check was offered in evidence, not the 1961 check.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.211" offset="3016182">Now, the government in their reply brief simply stated that the reason that the 1961 check was not offered in evidence at that time was because no check was issued, the return indicating a balance due.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.149" offset="3083995">Walter Herron, the Special Assistant Treasurer of the United States whom the government brought down from Washington, testified that two government checks were issued and that two were cashed.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.912" offset="3139062">To me, it's quite obvious why the 1961 refund check was not offered in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.518" offset="3165393">The names may have been similar but I'm of the opinion that the signatures were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.315" offset="3196635">Now, I suggest that the real purpose of Lawless' visit to Raiford was not to obtain the consent as he testified to extend the statute limitation but merely to obtain a sample of the defendant's handwriting under the guise of a civil routine tax investigation, when in truth and in fact, the material was being used with a view of ascertaining evidence of criminal wrongdoing that to me poses an issue which strikes at the very core of constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.376" offset="3384926">Of course, the recurring argument made on that type of case is that society's need for interrogation outweighed the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.206" offset="3436231">What they are really saying is that the taxpayer's own records and statement represent the easiest shortcut to a criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.611" offset="3481788">Now, this Court in Gilbert versus California ruled that handwriting samples not to be evidence of testimonial or communicative in nature, included within the Fifth Amendment although Mr. Chief Justice Warren dissented, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.266" offset="3584397">Now, Mathis may have had a different aspect, had Lawless merely obtained Mathis' signature, but Agent Lawless went beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.618" offset="3645837">What he did was he showed Mathis a return and said, “Is this your signature?”</text>
            <text syncTime="897.176" offset="3692126">and Mathis answered that it was and he said, “Is this your return?”</text>
            <text syncTime="902.964" offset="3715218">and Mathis answered that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.875" offset="3738833">To me it cannot logically be argued that such answers to such questions are not evidence of testimonial or of a communicative nature included within the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.400" offset="3804975">Now, we're getting back to Agent Derry.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.569" offset="3817618">As early as February 6, 1963, Special Agent Derry of the Intelligence Division received certain documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.248" offset="3860355">They were later introduced in evidence as government's exhibit 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.793" offset="3882506">What these documents consisted of was a letter which was allegedly written by Mathis to his wife, showing that he intended to file two tax refunds for one year, the year 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.343" offset="3952724">Now, this fact was mentioned by the government in their statement, their opening statement to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.778" offset="3982503">The government was permitted to use that information against Mathis to show knowledge and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.764" offset="4010402">And I suggest that the Internal Revenue Service, Intelligence Division, became suspicious of Mathis in February of 1963, some 20 or 21 months before Agent Lawless made his visit to Raiford.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.892" offset="4082918">That was on October 30th of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.958" offset="4099218">Now, I'd like to point out at this time how this letter was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.799" offset="4126595">This letter was intercepted by Sheriff Buckles of Osceola County and I assume that Mathis at that time was in the county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.867" offset="4174869">Buckles telephoned Agent Derry and at Buckles' request, Agent Derry made a trip to Kissimmee to Sheriff Buckles' Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.165" offset="4216038">The letter and the two returns were given to Agent Derry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.617" offset="4237876">And as Agent Derry testified, he kept two returns, the two returns and the letter in his locked personal file until June 4th of 1965 when he turned them over to Special Agent Shelley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.903" offset="4314990">And as I said before, it's beyond belief that a trained and veteran criminal investigator would just put away these documents and simply forget them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.027" offset="4363473">Yet the government would have us believe that they found definite indications of fraud on March 10th of 1965, which is when they referred the case to the Intelligence Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.316" offset="4416658">Now, the government claims that Agent Lawless was stationed in the Jacksonville Office which is approximately 100 miles north of Orlando.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.643" offset="4461902">Agent Derry was stationed in the Orlando Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.995" offset="4479352">But I drove up and I was able to check the distance, it is 145 miles from Orlando to Jacksonville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.931" offset="4519058">It is 50 miles from Jacksonville to Raiford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.802" offset="4534627">It is 16 miles from Orlando to Kissimmee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.086" offset="4551764">So then it was only natural that Agent Lawless would visit Mathis at Raiford since Jacksonville is much closer to Raiford than Orlando.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.195" offset="4592201">Now, our second assignment of error is based upon the Court depriving the petitioner of a fair and impartial trial guaranteed to him under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution in refusing throughout the trial to hear a motion to suppress the evidence as provided by the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.248" offset="4676315">And we feel that this was a clear abuse of discretion by Judge Choate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.871" offset="4698885">Now, in challenging the legality of this evidence and how it was obtained, trial counsel repeatedly moved to suppress it and the trial judge, in rejecting that offer stated, “It's too late now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.901" offset="4751026">I will hear it during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.546" offset="4761579">You can do it later on to suppress it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.183" offset="4772133">The evidence will probably come in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.044" offset="4787597">And still refusing to hear the motion to suppress, the trial judge further stated, “I will overrule that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.799" offset="4822601">You don't have to advice everybody of his rights every time you ask him questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.447" offset="4845171">I think we are coming to that pretty quickly if the Supreme Court keeps on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.043" offset="4871502">Mr. Lorie, the trial lawyer, responded, “We have come to that in the case of Miranda versus Arizona,” and the judge replied, “</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.246" offset="4908387">Oh no!</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.586" offset="4913716">Miranda says if you arrest a man you have a collar on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.256" offset="4932420">You can ask him any questions”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.934" offset="4943078">That's all it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.705" offset="4954154">Now, I know of no greater or stronger collar than one made of rock and steel surrounded by armed guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.849" offset="5006817">In any event, I take the position that had the judge heard the motion to suppress the evidence outside of the presence of the jury, that his ruling would have been the same, it would have been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.259" offset="5060420">He was not too happy with the Miranda decision obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.240" offset="5084348">Now, in denying the petitioner the right to a hearing on his motion to suppress outside the presence of the jury was highly prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.037" offset="5111515">The jury was able to hear throughout the testimony of certain government witnesses that the petitioner was incarcerated in the Florida State Penitentiary for an unrelated offense and that to deny him a motion to suppress outside their presence and hearing, certainly denied the petitioner a right to a fair and impartial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.357" offset="5220812">Now, in referring to the incarceration in the presence of the jury, was just as highly prejudicial as informing the jury of the defendant's prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.926" offset="5287058">In Pinto versus Pierce, 389 U.S. at page 31 which is cited by the government, this was an application by a state prisoner for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.770" offset="5334497">The facts are of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.631" offset="5341915">Pierce was convicted of robbery in a New Jersey Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.963" offset="5359261">He applied for writ of habeas corpus to the District Court for the District of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.432" offset="5381099">The United States District Court granted the writ and allowed the petitioner a new trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.768" offset="5410461">What Pierce was seeking was a new trial because the testimony in regard to the voluntariness of his incriminating statement was heard and determined by the judge in the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.787" offset="5470542">The United States Court of Appeals Third Circuit affirmed, saying that the United States District Judge was plainly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.681" offset="5506069">I asked this Court to wield and broaden Miranda brush to effect the cure concerning the constitutional principles which are or certainly should be applied to tax cases and to the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.368" offset="5576808">I respectfully urge this Court that the conviction of Mathis should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.031" offset="5631457">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.527" offset="5653504">The privilege against self-incrimination of course prohibits only involuntary incriminating statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.266" offset="5684433">It speaks of, “No person shall be compelled to give testimony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.408" offset="5701047">Voluntary admissions, even if made to a government investigating agent, even if in the course of a criminal investigation, which is I'll come to briefly this was not, are not inadmissible as obtained under the Fifth Amendment, if an admission is made voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.446" offset="5765204">Now, this Court in its Miranda decision concluded that because of the experience in this country with police interrogation, the circumstances under which experience have shown the police interrogate prisoners that it was necessary to apply special protections to insure that in the case of interrogation by the police in the stationhouse, that would appear to be a voluntary admission was in fact voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.322" offset="5896652">That is additional protections were made necessary because of the experience showing that has conducted in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.231" offset="5940328">Interrogation of a man who had been taken into the police station in an inherently compelling effect of itself, that is the mere circumstances as shown in the police manuals, the psychological pressures, the tricks, the situations that were arranged by the police in questioning a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.620" offset="6021831">This itself raised serious doubt as to whether when a man did speak to the police when he did make incriminating admissions, whether this really was the result of free choice on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.529" offset="6073448">And therefore, this Court said that because of these situations, in order to effectuate the privilege, in order to be sure that when a man speaks after he had been interrogated at the police station, after he had been taken away from his home, certain additional protections were necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.499" offset="6145337">How to be specifically won, precisely what his constitutional rights are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.510" offset="7469432">Because if I may explain, Mr. Chief Justice, the way the service, the organization of the service how the service conducts these investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.315" offset="7504645">Ordinarily, an investigation such as was made by Internal Revenue Agent Lawless is considered to call an audit and the only function of a man making an audit is to determine whether the tax return accurately reflects the tax reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.270" offset="7568488">The Internal Revenue Service has another branch known as the Intelligence Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.604" offset="7585834">And it's the Intelligence Division has charge of investigating possibilities of criminal tax fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.331" offset="7612688">Mr. Lawless testified that his sole job in this case was to investigate the civil tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.190" offset="7644139">He explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.018" offset="7647483">He said, all he was attempting to do is to determine the correct tax on these returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.423" offset="7669112">He himself unequivocally testified that he was not making any criminal investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.030" offset="7691473">He also testified that -- at page 37 of the record -- that if he discovered that there were definite indications of fraud, his duty was to turn the matter over to the Intelligence Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.976" offset="7747271">Now, Mr. Lawless made two visits to the petitioner in the Florida penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.223" offset="7780289">His first visit was made at the end of October 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.683" offset="7806098">Prior to that time, and the record does not show the circumstances under which it taken place, the petitioner had already granted one extension of time for the running of the statute of limitations on the assessment of any additional tax against him or corresponding we would also extend his time for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.356" offset="7888750">That extension was due to expire at the end of December and Agent Lawless testified that when he went to the penitentiary, to see the petitioner at the end of October, he said his visit had two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.842" offset="7954787">He said, first of all, he wanted to determine whether the returns that were assigned to him for audit were the returns of the petitioner and secondly, to get an extension of time on the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.206" offset="8004211">Now, what Agent Lawless did, he came in and said to the man he held up his return which he had for 1960 and said, “Is ths your return?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.336" offset="8036707">The man said, “Yes” and he said, “Is this your signature?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.343" offset="8044753">And he said “Yes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.020" offset="8047470">This seems to us a normal question to be asked when an agent is investigating someone's civil tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.366" offset="8072861">The first thing he wants to know if he's sure he's got the right man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.647" offset="8085922">Then the second thing he did was in effect ask him, we asked him, again to extend the statute of limitation, something that petitioner had done previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.722" offset="8122284">He testified that he explained to the petitioner that he had no obligation to sign this, that was up him to explain the consequences of it and the petitioner signed it.</text>
