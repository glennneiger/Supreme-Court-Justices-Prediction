            <text syncTime="14.888" offset="162879">This case is here on an appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, dismissing two counts of a seven-count indictment brought under the revenue laws, dismissing on grounds of expiration of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.670" offset="254098">The question here is on what date did the six-year statute of limitations apply to these two counts begin to run?</text>
            <text syncTime="51.872" offset="310836">The choices are two; was it the date when the returns were in fact filed after the statutory deadline but during a period of extension granted by the Commissioner?</text>
            <text syncTime="66.393" offset="368933">Or did the limitations period begin to run on the earlier date when the statutory deadline came?</text>
            <text syncTime="75.813" offset="406653">The case arose in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.765" offset="422431">It involves the tax returns -- these two counts involved the tax returns of two corporations, the Gordonsville Company and the Kimball Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.898" offset="470915">Each was reporting its income on a fiscal year basis, reporting for the year ending with February so that the return due to be filed in 1960 related to the taxable year ending February 29, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.053" offset="551581">Under the statute, those two corporate returns were due to be filed on May 15, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.611" offset="585853">Instead of filing at that time, the two corporations asked for and obtained a three-month extension of time for filing until August 15, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.052" offset="639561">Then on August 12 of that year, the Kimball return was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.080" offset="667669">Three days later on the extended deadline, August 15th, the Gordonsville return was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.110" offset="703822">The indictment was brought in on the sixth anniversary of the filing of the Kimball return on August 12, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.450" offset="745200">If the statute began to run when the return was filed, the indictment relating to these two returns was timely, otherwise, it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.122" offset="795878">The indictment in seven counts has seven counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.678" offset="810088">Each one relating to a corporate return filed on behalf of one of five corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.218" offset="844257">In Count 4, the one that relates to Gordonsville, it charges that the appellees attempted to evade and defeat tax due from Gordonsville by filing a false and fraudulent returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.209" offset="912175">Count 6, the other one that was dismissed, relates to the Kimball return filed on August 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.093" offset="947702">It charges that the appellees falsely and fraudulently overstated Kimball's gross receipts in that return.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="269.112" offset="1179773">Our information of the importance of this as I recall is that there, I believe, we're told that approximately a dozen cases a year arise where the return was filed during extended period of time and the indictment is brought and after the sixth anniversary of the statutory due date.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.776" offset="1266500">Because you would assume that the United States would somehow rather be able to spur the fact curiously and not so as to eliminate this question of six years in which to bring these actions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="308.377" offset="1336926">Well, of course, the prosecution could be brought within five years and nine months.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="314.225" offset="1360227">If that were the statute, I imagine, many more of them would be brought within five years and nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.069" offset="1379662">Of course, this case though isn't as simple as the ordinary one might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.559" offset="1405576">I don't know the underlying facts and the record was never developed to show them in detail before these counts were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.305" offset="1436609">But it does involve seven tax returns, all filed in this August, corporations that the record doesn't show the relationship of them but the appellee Habig was apparently present of all five and the other appellee had some connection with the preparation of the tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.078" offset="1519679">And I think, the records of all kinds of tax cases indicate the reasons why Congress thought that some extended period was necessary to investigate tax fraud.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="368.043" stopTime="382.355">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="368.043" offset="1575581">Well, no I'm not raising that obviously since the promoting the fact, the operation of the democratic principle would never do anything until the last possible moment and that it has created this problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="382.355" stopTime="811.833">
            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="382.355" offset="1632841">I won't speak in defense of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.852" offset="1646738">I'd rather rely on the statutory language, if I may, and the first statute that we point to in this case is Section 6531 of the Internal Revenue Code, which establishes the basic six-year period of limitations in this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.447" offset="1725210">And towards the beginning of this provision, it says that the period of limitation shall be six years in classes of crimes that are covered by these two counts and the context makes clear that the six years is the six years next after the commission of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.325" offset="1804622">The other part of the statute of 6531 as an issue here is the very last sentence and it reads “for the purpose of determining the periods of limitation on criminal prosecutions, the rules of Section 6513 should be applicable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="445.998" offset="1887378">And the precise and narrow question here is.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.584" offset="1901693">What are these rules of Section 6513?</text>
            <text syncTime="453.784" offset="1918516">Do any of them apply to bar the prosecution in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="458.901" offset="1938996">Section 6513 itself states a variety of rules for creating deemed times or artificial times of filing returns or payment of tax to determine when in the civil context and other connected sections on that part of the code when a suit for refund must -- a claim for refund must be filed or a suit filed in the Tax Court for redertermination.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.995" offset="2063339">The only part of Section 6513 that is invoked here is the first part, 6513(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="499.649" offset="2102000">The Government's contention, I think, is simple as that the first two words in the title of the subsection resolve the case and that everything else in the case is consistent with and confirms that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.111" offset="2171800">Those two words are ‘early return'.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.514" offset="2185383">The entire title of this subsection (a) is ‘Early Return or Advance Payment of Tax'.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.348" offset="2220805">There are three sentences in this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.636" offset="2237942">The first one and the second one are very similar, except that the first one deals with advance filings, which is the early return in the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.521" offset="2281409">The second one deals with advance payments or the advance payment of tax in the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.516" offset="2309413">The first -- now, the first sentence says, for the purposes of Section 6511, which deals with claims for refund and limits on refunds and credits, any return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.530" offset="2405543">The second sentence is very similar, again referring to other sections in this vicinity of the code relating to limits on credits and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.181" offset="2444100">It says, for purposes of Section 6511(b) (2) and (c) in 6512, payment of any portion of the tax made before the last day prescribed for the payment of the tax shall be considered made on such last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.050" offset="2519542">Both of these sentences have the same operative phrase, “before the last day prescribed”; and the first sentence “last day prescribed for filing” and the second “for payment”.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.105" offset="2575757">Now, in the abstract, viewing these two sentences alone, this phrase “the last day prescribed” can have several meanings because deadlines under the tax code are prescribed in several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.125" offset="2635839">It could mean the day prescribed by statute as in the case of income tax returns, prescribed by regulations as in the case of certain excised taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.963" offset="2679202">It could mean deadlines for payment of tax prescribed by elections that the taxpayer can make such as under certain state tax provisions or could mean the last day prescribed by extensions given by the Commissioner under his discretionary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.739" offset="2762376">This function of the third sentence, in our view, the third and last sentence of this section is to define and to delimit this phrase, “the last day prescribed” that occurs in each of the first two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.854" offset="2830817">The full text of that very sentence is for purposes of this subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.036" offset="2859551">The last day prescribed for filing the return or paying the tax shall be determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer and without regard to any election to pay the tax in installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.517" offset="2933426">Now, as the Government has read the statute and as the Government has urged the courts to construe it, the purpose and the only purpose of this last sentence is to eliminate two of the four possible meanings of the phrase “the last day prescribed” that appears in the first two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.420" offset="3029034">So that with this third sentence, the first two sentences mean that an early return is only that filed before the last day prescribed by statute or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.127" offset="3083891">It does not define as an early return, one filed before the last day prescribed by this in extension of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.634" offset="3125896">It does not -- it takes outside the word “advance payment of tax,” a payment made after the statutory or regulation deadline based on the taxpayer's election to pay in installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.662" offset="3185977">So it means that this section prescribes rules only for returns filed, payments made before deadlines prescribed by statute or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.441" offset="3245119">As we point out in our brief, the legislative history supports this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.057" offset="3271555">The committee reports, when this language was first inserted in ‘39 Code and ‘42, the committee report on Section 6513(a) when it was continued in the 1954 Code, both made clear that this is what the Congress had in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="825.209" offset="3404257">Mr. Justice Harlan, the practical effect is that for the great mass of us who file our tax returns sometime between January 1st and April 15th, it gives the Government a uniform expiration date six years from that April 15th and it has a similar effect in the other areas of tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.260" offset="3504462">What this -- our reading of this third sentence, thus, it say that those people who file after April 15th count their six years from the day they actually filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.431" offset="3549080">And this -- in terms of the great group of taxpayers, this works advantageous for both sides; it gives taxpayers counsel a uniformed deadline to work against in filing claims refund or suing on the Tax Court and it gives the Commissioner's people a uniformed deadline to work against in auditing most tax returns for a given year.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.480" offset="3697246">Now, we don't understand the appellees to disagree with this reading of the statute for civil purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.060" offset="3731623">They never concede that it's correct for civil purposes but they don't dispute it and they suggest that it may be correct for civil purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.503" offset="3905390">Justice Fortas, I think, perhaps the best way to answer that is to refer to the case of, I believe, the United States against Schettz in earlier case in the same District Court that this Court thought compelled the result have reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.493" offset="3965367">In a similar case, I believe, United States against Black I think in the District of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.254" offset="3992430">These were cases, I don't remember the precise days but essentially this is what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1287.712" offset="5254248">And now -- the only rules they state, in our view, apply only when a return is filed or the tax paid before the last day prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.883" offset="5306911">Because of the ambiguity of the word/phrase “the last day prescribed”, we read this last sentence as defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.664" offset="5342020">But let's assume that that's not the correct reading of that third sentence and I'd like to address myself to the consequences of it because I think that it brings into focus some of the difficulties with the District Courts ruling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.974" offset="5411297">If you eliminate this phrase “for purposes of this subsection”, all this third sentence says as in filing returns is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.753" offset="5454346">The last day prescribed for filing the return shall be determined without regard to any extension of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.438" offset="5489142">Now, how does that apply to this case to determine that the commission of the offense was earlier than the date on which the return was filed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.017" offset="5551417">All this says is that the last day prescribed for filing shall be determined without regard to any extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.789" offset="5578480">The day prescribed for filing is in no way an element of proof in the offense charged in these two counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.225" offset="5616306">The fact to be proved is that a false and fraudulent return was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.913" offset="5638980">Until that return is filed, there's no offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.385" offset="5656952">No offense has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.202" offset="5668133">No prosecution could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.003" offset="5679417">The -- the logic of transposing these words into a general rule applicable to this case would be to say that these offenses were committed on May 15, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.783" offset="5742529">But any -- no conviction could have been brought under any set of facts existing on May 15 at least under the indictment word such as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.801" offset="5778578">Now, I also think this brings to mind the way this rule has developed and I'd like to point to its origins, which are in two District Court cases involving a different charge, the charge of failure to file a return at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.036" offset="5855483">If you were dealing with that particular charge and if you excise for present purposes that first part of the statute, then you would have a rule that on its face could be applied to that criminal charge of failure to file because for failure to file, you must prove as an essential element the date prescribed for filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.313" offset="5948583">But the way the rule would be applied, as we see it, has an illogic that suggests that isn't what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.948" offset="5991215">Take an example of one of these cases, which I think is the Alper case in the District of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.880" offset="6026846">Here, a return was filed and then before the statutory deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.304" offset="6060596">I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.535" offset="6065507">No return was filed before the statutory deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.555" offset="6077628">An extension of time was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.671" offset="6090062">At the end of the extended time, still no return was filed and the case itself involved the pleading problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.541" offset="6129560">The -- and the question before the District Court was the offense of failing to file committed on the date that the return should have been filed under the statute or the later date under the extended time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.318" offset="6184626">Now, the Court held, and we think erroneously, that the offense was committed at the time the return should have been filed under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.448" offset="6237184">And the reason that we think that's erroneous is because of this example and this is why we don't think that the statute can be read in the way you suggest, Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.738" offset="6270307">Suppose a tax return is due on April 15th and instead of filing, the taxpayer asked and gets an extension to June 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.922" offset="6315029">And on June 15th, he files his return and there's nothing wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.571" offset="6345644">Under the reading of the court below, he could still be charged with the failure to file because he had not filed his return on April 15th when it was due under the statute without regard to any extension and we suggest that this is a simply not a logical reading of congressional intent unless there's a very specific language defining as a crime the failure to file in the presence of a duly granted the extension.</text>

            <text syncTime="2455.901" offset="9926928">Now, as I've pointed out, we believe that the scope of the application of the rules of Section 6513 must be determined by their meaning in their Section 6531 criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.120" offset="9999862">On the other hand, the Government's approach is to examine Section 6513 and more particularly Section 6513(a) independent of Section 6531.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.256" offset="10056391">And, further, the Government's approach is to interpret Section 6513(a) entirely in its civil context for which, of course, Section 6513 was drafted and enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.769" offset="10114487">But now, we say, 6513 being incorporated by reference in the Section 6531 a criminal prosecution statute, we say, we submit that the appellant has misread its interpretation by applying the civil context entirely and omitting any interpretation that involves its criminal context that goes by this incorporation by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.547" offset="10229530">These rules, we think, take on a new concern, namely, “determining the periods of limitation on criminal prosecutions”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.423" offset="10265057">Hence, we think, any of the limitations imposed on these rules of Section 6513 in their civil meaning, which are not in accord with these purposes of Section 6531 must be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.697" offset="10326183">Further, appellees urged that the rules -- that's the language -- rules of Section 6513 were intended to provide uniformity in fixing the period on limitation on criminal tax prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.253" offset="10392430">We believe that a reading of Section 6513 in its entirety now not 6513(a) alone because 6531 doesn't say 6513(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.312" offset="10440600">It says the rules of 6513.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.576" offset="10453661">We believe that that shows an intention by Congress to provide a uniform rule for determining the crucial question without regard to any extension of time granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.471" offset="10489292">Now, appellees urged that this provision in Section 6531 was new in the 1954 Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.562" offset="10541641">Therefore, up until that time, there would have been no dispute on this point as I understand the law that the Government's position would have been correct at time a return is filed, the date of it starts the statute of limitations running.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.579" offset="10609664">But Congress did something different when it enacted the ‘54 Code on criminal prosecutions by adding this provision this very last provision that's been quoted so often in 6531.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.042" offset="10667551">And we believe that thereby, the Congress intended 6513 to be read as it says, rules control the interpretation of criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.477" offset="10729305">Now, when Congress -- we believe Your Honors, when Congress has intended the result pressed by the Government here, it has directly said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.169" offset="10760025">For example, in subsection (a) of Section 6501 of the Internal Revenue Code, which sets forth the general rule of limitations on assessment and collections, it is provided that taxes “shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed whether or not such return was filed on or after or after the date prescribed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.435" offset="10881128">Hence, only when the Congress has clearly and expressly said for such rule as it did in 6501(a) should the construction urged by the Government be adopted that this is a criminal case, it is crucial in resolving the question here since the rules of Section 6513 are here part of a limitation statute for a statutory crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.698" offset="10990216">They are to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose as said in the Scharton case in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.249" offset="11028355">This means, we believe, that for the purposes of the rules of Section 6513 in their civil context that the purposes should be disregarded to the extent they are not in conformity with the criminal limitation purposes of 6531 and the general policy are reposed governing statutory crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.075" offset="11127724">In support of our interpretation also, we would like to emphasize that it is not just the word “Section 6513” or “Section 6513(a)” with its varying civil associations and ramifications which is incorporated in the Section 6531.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.948" offset="11199195">It is instead, as Congress used the word, its rules that are so incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.158" offset="11232005">We believe that clearly, Congress advisedly used the phrase “rules of Section 6513” rather than simply saying Section 6513 or it could have said, as appellate contends, just 6513(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.446" offset="11297207">Because if we read all of that section, we believe that the interpretation will show that it is a broader concept than the narrow civil interpretation could be by picking sentence apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.919" offset="11359065">Now, we believe that the rules of this section relevant to this appeal are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.296" offset="11380590">First, the rule that is several times set forth in Section 6513, in (b) and (c) and not only in (a), that in certain circumstances, returns are deemed filed and certain payments made on the due date for filing or payment prescribed by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.703" offset="11454151">Second, the rule, which is in the last sentence of subsection (a), which states that extensions of time are to be disregarded in determining the due date prescribed by a statute”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.666" offset="11498036">This rule, we believe, puts persons charged with tax crime with respect to returns for which the extensions of time were granted on the same footing for purposes only of determining periods on limitation as those --</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.315" offset="11836583">In other words, in 6531, we have the criminal tree, as you've said the three years or the six years punishment -- I mean period depending on the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.179" offset="11880051">Then when Congress says, but we incorporate by reference the rules, the rules now whatever that interpretation should be into Sections 6531 and 6513 was enacted, both its predecessor in the ‘39 Code and in ‘54 Code for civil purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.749" offset="11966360">I say we're now in drafting that on the criminal tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.973" offset="11987257">And we think that that has to be read as I've said in this interpretation and not in the solely civil.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.903" offset="12070954">The Government has no difficulty in saying the deemed filed rule is the offense committed date for early returns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.698" offset="12154128">They have no -- I say, no difficulty in criminal instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.490" offset="12165308">Do you know the return is filed January 2nd, Your Honor?</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.024" offset="12183489">The six-year period, the offense is not committed under the Government's position and we would agree until April 15 which is three-and-a-half months later.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.475" offset="12249318">Your Honor, we believe that that's what the Congress intended of course, to make again a uniform date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.515" offset="12273455">And we all know it's difficult to adopt as we strive constantly to interpret some of the statutory provisions and each time they are fragmented into a different due date or different effective date, we think that Congress just didn't intend that and when it intended it, it said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.468" offset="12357256">It has said it many other times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.245" offset="12364361">I only cite one instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.634" offset="12373870">It can say so and it knows how to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.873" offset="12386826">So, we think that when the Government argues on brief for example, that our position extends the statute of limitations, it doesn't extend it that's making the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.168" offset="12424025">The statute is six years but as Your Honors has said, Mr. White -- Justice White, six years from what date just as six years on an early return or six years where no return?</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.827" offset="12546696">We believe the Congress incorporated the entire section and not only (a) but the others that all seem we think point to a uniform prescribed due date.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.014" offset="12635408">What meaning do you think the Government gives to that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lester M. Ponder</label>
            <text syncTime="3135.551" offset="12645543">Well, from the Government's argument, I would feel that they're saying that for purposes of the civil context entirely and reading it for purposes of this subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.602" offset="12689742">I think it could be subject to that interpretation, for that civil purpose only and I think it also could be argued the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.397" offset="12720985">I think it has -- it could be argued the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.377" offset="12728926">I do want though to point out, before my time expires, one thing on legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.430" offset="12749093">Now, they're just -- there is no legislative history here that has any bearing on this question despite the statement of the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.970" offset="12795277">The reference by the appellant to the 1942 legislative history is not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.874" offset="12830908">That was with respect to the predecessor of Section 6513 solely in its civil context, 12 years before this provision in question was put into Section 6531.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.112" offset="12895796">So Congress couldn't have had any meaning in mind with respect to the criminal prosecution period of limitations, 12 years before it enacted the very Section 6531, that we're here concerned with primarily, that is how long does the statute run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.386" offset="12976880">There was no reference back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.565" offset="12985657">There was no such provision or any incorporation by reference until 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.634" offset="13021915">Secondly, of course, we think that that language in the congressional reports in the ‘42 Amendment dealt solely with its civil context again and could have had no bearing on the criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.491" offset="13081370">And it has to be, we think, examined in the light of the criminal provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.144" offset="13103940">Now, we also would like to point out that again, back to as when is the offense committed, which of course is a crucial question or the crucial question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.929" offset="13147094">The this offense is not -- as I said, statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.897" offset="13162977">Therefore, the date and the way of committing it is not an innately human act but is a statutorily defined act, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.850" offset="13202787">Therefore, we think, it is the most reasonable interpretation to say that the statutory due date deemed filed which admittedly and no one disputes it, applies at early returns, and would likewise apply to late returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.640" offset="13293902">We believe that the Government here is thus urging a dual standard result: the statutory filing date for returns filed early and the actual physical filing date for returns filed late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.349" offset="13344789">And if the Congress had intended such a result, we believe, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.651" offset="13366000">On the other hand, appellees urged a single stand to prove, namely: that the period of limitations run from the statutory due date for filing regardless of whether the return was filed early, late or on the due date itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.975" offset="13431306">One prescribed date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.518" offset="13441442">And we believe that when the Congress changed the applicable statutory provisions in 1954, it intended this single standard rule result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.394" offset="13484910">In other words, we feel, that the appellant is reading Section 6531 as follows, the applicable provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.496" offset="13537364">We think he is reading it this way for the purpose of determining the periods of limitation when on criminal prosecutions with respect to early returns the rules of Section 6513 shall be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.187" offset="13604133">Now, Congress could have said so and it has said so in other sections of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.240" offset="13632345">And we believe that it had an intended to say so here, it would have done it in plain, unmistakable light.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.663" offset="13665991">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.130" offset="13699845">Yes, if I may briefly make two points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.999" offset="13727326">First, in terms of what the offense is charged here are, they both go to the filing of false returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.698" offset="13758151">Section -- Count 4 of the indictment speaks of an attempt to evade and defeat tax by filing a false return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.786" offset="13798484">Count 6, brought under another section of the statute speaks of, I believe, procuring the preparation and presentation of a false return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.159" offset="13848012">The -- and presentation, of course, I assume is equivalent with filing a false return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.519" offset="13877478">The other point is we do not suggest that 6513(a) for any purpose defines when the offense is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.242" offset="13912377">It's a towing provision and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.018" offset="13923453">It's a provision -- for example, in the case of the early return, under the appellees' reading, if the return were filed on January 15, no crime would be committed until April 15 and a prosecution brought in February or March wouldn't be possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.506" offset="14001403">We suggest that this is just another illogic in the reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.737" offset="14014360">When the -- when the crime is committed, when the offense is committed, it's determined by when the returned is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.910" offset="14042990">And the sole effect of 6513 just as, say sections of the law, relating to the defendants out of the jurisdiction tows the running of the statute.</text>
