            <text syncTime="89.957" offset="463182">Yesterday at the point of the unfunny event in this forum, Mr. Justice Fortas had propounded a series of questions that go to the attempt to find a post revenue balance on the basis of the Commission's decision in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.857" offset="550849">Mr. Justice White had propounded a series of questions dealing with the quality treatment deduction cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.921" offset="595048">I would state that the answers to those two series of questions actually cannot be made on the face of the Commission decision or its opinion on rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.173" offset="656071">The difficulty that I believe the Court is having and that all counsel are having in discussing those two questions is precisely what was found by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.883" offset="706853">In a normal rate case whether it is individual company or a group rate case, the agency makes findings as to the cost that he is going to allow in the rate and findings as to the rates it is allowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.750" offset="782399">We then proceed if there are judicial review questions that these questions are weld if they leave out a cost or did they not.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.017" offset="827434">There's one side of the other thing, a cost allowed was generous or not generous is the rate of return high or low under the Hope test.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.115" offset="875813">The problem we have in this case is precisely what was said by the Court of Appeals in order for that Court or this Court to address itself to those questions, there are certain limited gaps in the Commission's findings in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.672" offset="946030">Now, to go to Mr. Justice Fortas' problem with this revenue costs balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.273" offset="980511">We had the 14.5 cents cost of flowing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.336" offset="1004753">That is a cost finding by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.266" offset="1020426">It is based on a number of underlying subsidiary findings as to each of the cost involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.588" offset="1049684">The Court of Appeals did not disturb that.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.834" offset="1062745">We are not attacking that.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.673" offset="1074030">To apply the Hope test however, you have to compare that figure with what is the average revenue under the prescribed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.645" offset="1121991">Unfortunately, in this case in order to know what the prescribed rates are we need to know what is shown by this evidence of pipeline cost that would have to be used to arrive at the prescribed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.613" offset="1193775">What the resultant rates are?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.448" offset="1205164">Make some multiplications by the volume sold and we would come out with an average revenue figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.622" offset="1233899">Which figure should be the one that Mr. Justice Fortas was seeking to compare with this 14.5 cent figure?</text>
            <text syncTime="291.924" offset="1271097">Now yesterday, we had talked about the 12.72 cent figure but that is the average revenue in 1960 at all of the contracts and rates then in effect that includes these 18 cent rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.741" offset="1362317">It include the whole spectrum of the 3 cent rates and everything in between and it averaged 12.72.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.342" offset="1400769">Now under the prescribed rates, we know a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.295" offset="1420518">We know first of all that all of them in that batch that were above 14.5 cents are reduced first to the 14.5 cent level.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.018" offset="1475480">Then on the rates for the 90% of the gas involved in this case which is not eligible for the pipeline quality rate, the prescribed rates are lower so that as we review the case and if you accept some of these estimates of how much is this pipeline quality subtraction the average revenue under the prescribed rates will be lower than the 12.72 cent figure that existed in 1960.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="383.965" offset="1639215">Because the figure that was given to us was 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.680" offset="1658128">-- I think it was a maximum rate -- of the range of 1.7 cents deduction for this pipeline cost due to the lower quality of the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.176" offset="1712044">And if you'd deduct that from 14.5 cents, you're still above 12.72.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.699" offset="1742137">Now, my method of -- my approach to this must be wrong when you wouldn't be making this argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.244" offset="1848299">I have to go outside of this record and talk about these materials as to pipeline cost which the Commission of course has now but they are not in the record before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="767.366" offset="3172812">How could you have findings on that?</text>
            <text syncTime="769.022" offset="3179499">What the Commission is doing in effect is saying that people who have this point made contacts for gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.690" offset="3218160">And more of them 14.5 just as you've said roughly have to and -- have to or reduce a future contract to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.589" offset="3261733">People have made contracts at lower figure and if the marketplace permits to make contracts at a higher figure than their previous contract price up to 14.5.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.481" offset="3317321">Well now, actually on the basis of experience as I understand this, the industry revenues may not be 14.5, they're maybe less than that rate by considerable amount, that's your point, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carroll L. Gilliam</label>
            <text syncTime="817.793" offset="3374582">It -- they can be under given set of facts and the test year and it could happen in this case from 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.787" offset="3406555">But that has very great legal significance in rate regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.673" offset="3430066">If the combination of all of these contracts produced an average revenue that is below the average revenue requirement, it means that you can't say that the rates, the totality of revenue is unjust and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.132" offset="3515852">Now, that doesn't mean that the Commission is closed from looking at the spectrum and saying that this is discriminatory and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.334" offset="3560678">But that the first step in a rate case before you start to design the rates to be placed in effect is this cost revenue balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.790" offset="3606549">Now, once you make that and if the Commission filed as it could find in any case, yes, the industry revenue is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.164" offset="3648031">What is the next step?</text>
            <text syncTime="888.250" offset="3656391">It is to design a structural rates and even in this case, there's no single uniform rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.751" offset="3690350">The Commission has designed a structure of differing rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.491" offset="3709367">But Mr. Justice Fortas when they imposed it, it automatically sets aside the contract prices and this is imposed in lieu of that but it still as we see the majority opinion in Hope and as the Court of Appeals concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.017" offset="3787421">It means that even under the group method the revenue -- the average revenue under that spectrum of rates should at least be such that the industry has the opportunity and I emphasize opportunity because this doesn't guarantee anything, its opportunity, to earn the average cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.828" offset="3886686">Its average revenue, average cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.176" offset="3900061">Now, on -- included as Your Honor said is this 12% rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.350" offset="3928795">That is a piece that makes up the 14.5 cent cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.847" offset="3954709">It is significant in this case because the Commission says, “Well, even though you may not have gotten a balance, you certainly didn't get the 14.5 cent cost, therefore you didn't get the 14 -- the 12% return but that was kind of generous, so what?”</text>
            <text syncTime="983.217" offset="4036211">To apply the Hope test and for a Court to review a rate case it is not reviewing a hypothetical 12% return or something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.438" offset="4085112">The Court has to know what is the return that was allowed, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.552" offset="4109563">Doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.920" offset="4115101">If I stand up here and tell you that the 12% is too low and somebody else says it's too high, if that isn't what is allowed in this rate, what difference does it make out?</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.898" offset="4155016">There's no point in wasting the time of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.530" offset="4165465">What we should be talking about is the 12 -- it is not the 12% but what was the return allowed in the rates prescribed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.885" offset="4210918">Now, the 12 may sound high but there's a significant reason for that and it has to do with the difference in the equity debt ratio in the producing industry with ordinary utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.686" offset="4266088">The Court's were accustomed to hearing 6% and times passed and that seems to be the sacrosanct magic number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.718" offset="4294196">But just as a hypothetical example, in pipelines and in most utilities the equity is usually only about 15% of the total capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.677" offset="4346128">The rest of the total capital is debt but at least until times recently the companies that get is 4.5% or something along that line 4.5 to 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.144" offset="4395969">It certainly is not possible today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.432" offset="4405060">But assume that in my example when they allow 6% on the total capitalization, it means that the equity gets 9 to 10% and on page 144 of the Commission's brief they correctly state that, “in recent pipeline cases, they have allowed and this is based on evidence about the market cost money and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.866" offset="4538807">Rates of return that permitted pipeline equity that earn 10 to 12% on the equity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.720" offset="4578304">Now, let me shift from that to the producer situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.988" offset="4595336">The Commission made finding at the finding in the rate of return part of its opinion that an equity investment in a producing company is far riskier than this pipeline equity investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.962" offset="4651238">And I don't think there is any party to the case and that would include the Commission staff who disagrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.242" offset="4688332">It is a well-known fact that it is one of the riskiest investments that anyone could make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.177" offset="4720097">And this brings me right back to one of the reasons that the producers have an 85% equity, it's this simple, you can't finance the bulk of exploration by going to a bank and conservative institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.478" offset="4785298">It has to be done with equity money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.069" offset="4799613">And that it has to be primarily generated internally through the rates collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.694" offset="4826154">But let me get to the mathematics of this 12% return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.846" offset="4846738">The Commission in its brief has these numbers that Mr. Justice White pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.327" offset="4868681">If you apply that both in this case the effect of it is to reduce this 12% to something on the order of 9.5 or 9 or 10 or somewhere in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.809" offset="4926568">But what that does to the producer equity in this case, if that is correct, is to reduce the allowed return to the producer equity below that or certainly no higher than that, that the Commission is allowing on the pipeline case equity and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.380" offset="5008906">And yet in the rate or return part of this decision there is finding at the finding that the producer equity is riskier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.165" offset="5047986">Now, of course no one asked this Court or any other court to pick 12, 9, 10 or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.913" offset="5082990">What the Court of Appeals said is that the cost of this pipeline quality thing, first of all there is the procedural error, it isn't in the record, we can't quantify in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.901" offset="5130951">It does have the effect of reducing this cost revenue balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.674" offset="5154043">It obviously has this effect on the allow of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.220" offset="5176299">We can't fill those gaps or speculate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.675" offset="5190092">It is a function of the Commission to make the additional findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.308" offset="5208586">Now, just briefly, this limited remand somebody said yesterday that it could take forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.632" offset="5237948">It is not under the Court of Appeals opinion and it would be true under any limited remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.369" offset="5272848">By this Court it would be in accordance with the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.949" offset="5287163">It is a practical matter would contemplate getting into this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.075" offset="5307643">These pipeline quality and cost data that they have and adjusting the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.684" offset="5342124">And I think in the essence that was what the Court of Appeals was asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.469" offset="5357275">They certainly have not discarded this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.459" offset="5393220">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.283" offset="5404505">First, let me take care of couple of minor matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.919" offset="5423000">There were some statement yesterday by Texas and New Mexico that we had excluded the evidence they submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.697" offset="5454137">The Attorney Generals were in error there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.010" offset="5463437">We did not exclude the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.282" offset="5472528">In fact, some of the evidence is in the joint appendix here, extracts from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.888" offset="5490918">It was admitted into the record and was considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.208" offset="5508159">We did reach the results that they wanted but there's no exclusion problem involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.345" offset="5532714">Now, let me take up the problem which I did not take up in my initial argument which was raised by counsel for Bass yesterday and that is the argument that the Commission ignored some very substantial expenses which are born by the plant sellers, the producers who purchase on -- normally on percentage contracts from producers in the field gathered, process and then sell at the tailgate of the plant and the argument made yesterday was -- that it was outrageous with the Commission to fix a price for gas at the tailgate of a plant after gathering and processing which was the same as the price of fixed for gas-well gas in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.742" offset="5742320">Now, obviously whether the Commission has properly or improperly decided every issue here, it isn't foolish and it didn't overlook this very major problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.270" offset="5800417">Their estimates can be made many ways but probably as much time was spent on cost of gasoline plants, so-called gasoline plants in this record as any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.268" offset="5856423">That the examiner discusses this matter in great detail in his opinion at pages 226 to 231, where he explains why despite all these costing, he thinks it make sense to price it on a value basis which after all is exactly what's happening in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.459" offset="5933223">They have in fact sold at the same prices roughly as the price of the pipelines play at the well head for gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.642" offset="5977945">And at pages 328 to 341, if you want to go through a very interesting exercise, he goes into great depths on the costing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.334" offset="6016711">Because both the Commission and the examiner in coming to the eventual conclusion that an exact cost involves just too many allocations to be exact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.522" offset="6073448">I've done so only in the light of a recognition that they were not by so doing giving too little for these various expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.303" offset="6120573">And let me briefly read you what the Commission said in response to Bass' arguments or with similar argument very point on rehearing and I'm reading from 1116 (d) of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.678" offset="6174072">They say, "It has been stated in the applications for rehearing of several producer respondents that the price of residue gas, derived from casinghead gas should be fixed at a higher price because the record would contain evidence which would establish this cost for the level above the 14.5 cents per Mcf based on gas well it cost".</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.594" offset="6269785">The record does not support this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.908" offset="6278980">On the contrary, well a precise cost computation of residue gas cannot be made with sufficient assurance of accuracy sure was a basis for fixing prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.626" offset="6321925">The evidence demonstrates the cost of residue gas is lower than the cost of flowing gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.331" offset="6344704">It reflects in the evidence and then they go on to discuss certain evidentiary matters which had been raised and which they disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.136" offset="6375946">Now this is not at all the picture that you got yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.442" offset="6393187">I don't want to go into this further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.978" offset="6399248">We've discussed it pages 157 to 159 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.716" offset="6422235">Briefly, let me refer to another argument made by counsel for Bass yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.713" offset="6446268">This was the procedural argument with respect to equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.822" offset="6466644">That equality wasn't in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.325" offset="6476675">Very difficult point it seems to us because we can't quite see how you could have an area case where you don't consider quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.690" offset="6510111">What -- in general let me refer you here if I may to pages 154 to 155 of our brief and particularly to the statement why the producers when they try to tie a rule making proceeding on quality to the Permian Basin decision, what they said was not that it was in the Permian Basin case but they said was and I'm quoting from there -- to my brief and this is a quote, “The producers in the Permian Basin proceeding have introduced evidence regarding quality standards in price differentials and planned to introduced additional evidence on such points when appropriate”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.684" offset="6678131">Now, what the Commission did was to say that it wasn't going to in the light of those statements try a general quality thing into this proceeding that nobody thought up until much later the quality wasn't an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.356" offset="6736750">Now Justice Fortas, I'm sorry to say that I agree with the counsel for Socony that it is not only useful from the standpoint of -- I think the entire industry for this Court to decide the moratorium issue but that -- this moratorium issue is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.402" offset="6820968">The technical reason for moratorium issue is not moot is because moratorium in a state, we haven't been able when people filed increase which would have been subject to the moratorium to not let them go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.580" offset="6897664">But we have assumed that the Court stay on the moratorium like everything else were subject to the final action of that Court and this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.155" offset="6932041">And the Commission has consisted with in allowing these increases to go into effect and they're clear that they were going into effect subject to the final outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.638" offset="6977912">So, there's considerable amount of money which means that the problem is not moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.370" offset="7100897">There was one argument here which we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.199" offset="7116152">I won't go any great length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.585" offset="7121690">That is the argument about the last “clean rate” problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.391" offset="7140916">I wouldn't even attempt to describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.920" offset="7147081">It was mentioned in some of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.018" offset="7155440">It was mentioned by counsel for Mobil yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.795" offset="7174562">I don't -- they want to decide it in May but the fact is on this one, the Commission expressly refrained from deciding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.825" offset="7210715">It has not been decided by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.190" offset="7220120">At the time of the Commission's decision it wasn't clear whether it was a real problem or not and we said we'd handle it when we got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.776" offset="7250526">So, this is not something which is the part of the Commission decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.967" offset="7275290">Now, briefly on the problem that Mr. Gilliam was speaking this morning, speaking to this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.831" offset="7310712">I want to make perfectly clear Justice White that there is a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.830" offset="7330670">The finding is that 1115 (d) of the record and what the finding is there's a longer paragraph on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.984" offset="7363271">It says, with the charges -- changes we have made with respect to quality standards, the average adjustments for gas-well gas will range from 0.7 to 1.5 reduced by the additional revenue for plant liquids and the effect of the BTU adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.415" offset="7449057">There is evidence upon that -- which that is based on -- it is evidenced which Mr. Gilliam doesn't think is good evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.197" offset="7492211">This evidence we think is clearly good enough evidence as well as the exporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.468" offset="7513213">And the evidentiary references, I will not labor the Court with but they are cited in our brief in the Footnote 15 at pages 142 to 143 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.696" offset="7594193">Finally, like my client put back on the track what I think Mr. Gilliam's argument comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.060" offset="7639646">I don't think once we get out of this morass of quality that this is a real problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.725" offset="7666291">There is a real problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.256" offset="7672351">What they are really saying, they phrased it, what Mr. Gilliam did this morning, in terms of letting us have the opportunity to earn this cost based standard price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.761" offset="7730448">But what this really boils down to is saying, set your rates to guarantee that the -- we will earn these revenues despite the fact that we have on a number of our sales previously contracted to charge less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.470" offset="7809233">And that is what the problem is really all about on the so-called revenue deficiency argument and I think or as I know this is something that I hope I explain in some detail on Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.405" offset="7888959">Oh, may I say one more word sir?</text>

            <text syncTime="1960.444" offset="7945174">We are asking as I said at the very beginning that the Court affirmed the Commission on all of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.055" offset="7975581">We hope that our brief has taken care of the matter and we certainly hope that the result of this case would be a full affirmation of the Commission decision.</text>
