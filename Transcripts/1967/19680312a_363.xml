            <text syncTime="22.197" offset="192136">Mr. Geller, you may now proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_geller" startTime="26.331" stopTime="520.118">
            <label>Mr. Henry Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="26.331" offset="208645">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.540" offset="221497">This case involves the impact of community antenna television on television allocations throughout the United States and of the FCC's jurisdiction to regulate CATV in order to preserve local television service.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.809" offset="290565">The issues in the case, the Commission's jurisdiction over CATV and its jurisdiction to inter relief order involve construction of the Communications Act of 1934 but the background facts are very important and I would like to go over them first.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.120" offset="363813">Now, the Commission and the Congress have long had a policy of local television service, of service coming from local sources rather emanating from just a few large metropolitan areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.767" offset="422431">The Commission, therefore, has devised a nationwide cable of TV assignments, assigning channels to hundreds of communities and specifying the heights and powers of the stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.339" offset="472691">The purpose of this plan is to get local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.945" offset="483140">To give an example that would be applicable in this case, the Commission could have given the Los Angeles stations a heightened power that was so great that they will put a very good signal in the San Diego even though it's a 120 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.601" offset="541759">And then the people in San Diego will get a great deal of service from Los Angeles but it would not be local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.780" offset="570493">It would not be service geared to serving the needs and interests of San Diego, its ministers, its schools, its politicians, its issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.552" offset="601631">So what the Commission has done is to specify heightened power in Los Angeles that results in the Los Angeles' signals being weak when they arrive in San Diego, so that you can have San Diego station.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.572" offset="653667">And this is not just the Commission policy but I say this is a congressional policy embodied in Section 307 (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.356" offset="692746">And now, to achieve this plan, the Commission has made use of 12 VHF channels, the Channels 2 to 13 and 70 UHF channels, Channels 14 through 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.444" offset="749171">But in the 1958, the UHF channels run into difficulty when they went into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.687" offset="774144">A number of them went off the air, the stations, people were not buying UHF sets and entrepreneurs were not entering UHF Broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.115" offset="811865">The Congress in 1962, to deal with this situation and at the urging of the Commission, passed the All Channel Television Receiver Law, which in effect specifies that all sets ship and interstate commerce shall be capable of receiving UHF.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.400" offset="880933">And the reason why Congress said it was doing this is that it had to make UHF viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.708" offset="898173">It was the only way to get this nationwide system of local television outlets and possibly afford the network.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.002" offset="927431">And we are getting the benefits of that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.567" offset="937671">There has been a great surge in interest in UHF.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.815" offset="950627">Stations are coming on the air particularly in the major markets and we are getting the additional outlets and they added competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.871" offset="978840">Now, what this case is all about really is the impact of community antenna television on this congressional and commission plan of local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.725" offset="1022307">And it's not all one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.273" offset="1028472">CATV can be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.793" offset="1042578">It can bring service to areas that do stand badly in the need of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.326" offset="1064626">As it develop originally, the CATV operator would go out to a -- put a tall antenna on a high mountain, get the signals that were available there.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.370" offset="1104854">Very often local signals and bring them down in the community that was in the valley and therefore, it wasn't getting any service or they will go out pretty far away from the town, put up again a tall antenna and get the signals, amplify them.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.633" offset="1157935">And bring them back to a town that was just too far away from a major population center and as a result, it was getting maybe only one or two signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.025" offset="1199522">And the Commission believes that's in the public interest and it's facilitated that with microwave brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.769" offset="1222405">When it looked at this problem in 1959, for the first time it found that CATV had little and no adverse impact in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.499" offset="1261380">But when it looked again in the 1960, CATV began undergoing a phenomenal growth pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.762" offset="1290428">And that growth pattern began to threaten the entire allocations plan of local service and raised a serious, a particularly serious threat in two instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.588" offset="1333687">One is the TV station serving a sparse population and the other is the instance of the new UHF stations that I mentioned that are going on the air in these major markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.708" offset="1382170">Now, I think I can illustrate the problem in the first instance by a specific case, a case called Carter Mountain that was decided in the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.272" offset="1420413">In Carter Mountain, you had a station in Riverton, Wyoming serving a very sparse population and CATV assistance begins springing up throughout its service area and these systems did not carry the local station.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.151" offset="1479973">All they brought in was a service from Denver, Colorado hundreds of miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.324" offset="1504632">The subscriber set to get his service of his cable going into the back of the set and when the local station wasn't on that cable, it was cut off from access to this audience, its own local audience and that's patently destructive, the Commission found, of local broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.927" offset="1575058">There was a second factor here and that is even if this local station had been carried, the CATV system was duplicating its programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.475" offset="1613302">As the Court notes from the case to follow, CATV presently stands outside the competitive TV programming distribution market.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.567" offset="1649664">The local station bids for its programming and getting exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.073" offset="1663666">Under the antitrust laws or under Communications Act Policy, reasonable exclusives are permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.520" offset="1689475">The CATV stands outside that structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.855" offset="1702745">As a result, if the local station is presenting Bonanza, let's say at 9:00, the CATV can be bringing Bonanza in from Denver at 9:00 and you're cutting the audience for this program in hafting.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.593" offset="1753736">An audience is what the local stations sells, to get revenues from advertisers in order to support this local operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.927" offset="1783097">The Commission found that if CATV continues to grow this way without any conditions, it would mean the demise of this local station and the Court of Appeals found that that holding was amply justified by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.275" offset="1848508">The Commission further found that if that happened, it would not be in the public interest for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.614" offset="1873795">CATV service is just not a substitute for local service for these three important reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.884" offset="1894902">First, the CATV does not serve the people in the local area.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.741" offset="1918307">It cost $3,000 to $4,000 in mile to string cable and as a result, it doesn't go out to the rural areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.094" offset="1947773">It's confined just to the built up areas in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.074" offset="1959685">In Carter Mountain, this meant that of 74,000 people, 40,000 of them would be left without any service and that clearly is not in the public interest, for some people to get service at the expense of those in the rural areas getting none.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.046" offset="2015587">Second, CATV is a form of pay TV and there are some people who cannot afford to pay so once again they wouldn't be getting service.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.607" offset="2045785">And third and very important, it is not local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.752" offset="2062399">It's always been brought in is Denver signals and they do not service in outlet for local expression for Riverton and so you would have a complete frustration of this congressional plan of local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.173" offset="2112031">Now, to deal with this in view of the trends as phenomenal growth factor, the Commission devised two reasonable rules: the first is that the local station be carried so it has access to its own local audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.160" offset="2180054">And the second rule --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="520.118" stopTime="522.333">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="520.118" offset="2183816">The local station.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.054" offset="2187577">What?</text>
            <text syncTime="521.299" offset="2188518">I'm sorry.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_geller" startTime="522.333" stopTime="623.980">
            <label>Mr. Henry Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="522.333" offset="2192697">That the local station be carried, Mr. Justice Fortas, that it get on the cable so that it has access to its own local audiences, I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.148" offset="2228015">The second is the same-day non-duplication rule and this was that the CATV system affords same-day non-duplication protection to the programs of the local station.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.440" offset="2285171">As the Court probably knows, network programming is distributed on a fairly simultaneous nationwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.141" offset="2315891">In this same-day non-duplication requirement therefore affords a great deal of protection to the network programming and that's a very important basis of the local operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.349" offset="2360717">Now, these -- I should point out that this allows the CATV to continue its valuable supplementary service, they continue to bring in the Denver signals that are not -- the programming is not there already.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.386" offset="2416933">Now, these rules as carried in non-duplication rule were adopted by the Commission after a lengthy rule-making proceeding in 1965 in a report called the First Report and they are made applicable at that time to Microwave Service Systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.937" offset="2491120">Our jurisdiction to regulate the Microwave Service CATV system is not challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.202" offset="2516198">In another rule-making proceeding, culminated in 1966 in the Second Report, we made the same carriage in non-duplication rules applicable and now to the non-Microwave Service System, the so called “off-the-air service system” and of course, our jurisdiction to do that is being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.029" offset="2591535">Now, the Second prop --</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_geller" startTime="625.379" stopTime="746.492">
            <label>Mr. Henry Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="625.379" offset="2604910">1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.629" offset="2609925">March 17th, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.366" offset="2624867">And now, the second problem that arose is I say concerned the new UHF Stations that were coming on the air in these major markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.556" offset="2661648">CATV in a revolutionary new development began going into areas that were unlike Riverton these areas had plenty of service: Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Sacramento, San Diego, they had all the network service.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.566" offset="2721625">And what CATV proposed to bring in to these areas were the New York independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.472" offset="2749210">An “Independent” is a station that is not affiliated with any network.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.622" offset="2765824">They would propose to bring in the three New York independents into Philadelphia or the three Los Angeles independents into Sacramento or into San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.791" offset="2802500">And it proposed to do so with very large scale operations: 12 channel systems, 20 channel systems proposed for the future, $37 million with the operation proposed in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.814" offset="2854640">Now, coming on the air, in the same major markets are the UHF stations and they are going to be independent in nature also.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.541" offset="2893511">For example, there are three UHF stations that are going to be independent on the air now in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.581" offset="2921723">The audience for this non-network, this independent programming is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.505" offset="2941367">Most of the people in the evening hours watch network programming and only the time the Second Report to figure was only 10% of the people turned away from the popular network programming to watch the non-network shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.366" offset="3000822">Now, without CATV bringing in these outside signals, the local UHF stations going on the air would have that audience to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.899" offset="3042931">With CATV, the audience is being fractionated.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.855" offset="3054843">It's limited and it's being split between the signals coming from New York and Los Angeles or in the local UHF one.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.803" offset="3086608">And the question --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Henry Geller</label>

            <text syncTime="751.577" offset="3109700">They would be fractionated.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.144" offset="3115969">It gets even more serious than that because even when you bring in the network programming station, that is a network affiliated station, 45% of its programming is non-network and you again get a fractionalization from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.832" offset="3170722">And the question before the Commission was what would be the effect to fractionating this limited audience on these UHF stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.445" offset="3205204">Now, the Commission in the Second Report said it did not know the answer because the answer depended upon how large the CATV systems would grow in these major markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.585" offset="3245746">But it did hope that if their growth was of a higher order or substantial 50% or more that they would cripple UHF and that the Commission went on to hold that that would not be in the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.881" offset="3986892">So one of the impact, not only upon this 16% devoted by network stations to local programming that we also have, do we not, the impact upon the non-network stations that are 100% applied (Voice Overlap)?</text>

          <turn speaker="henry_geller" startTime="983.622" stopTime="1332.803">
            <label>Mr. Henry Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="983.622" offset="4037883">You're quite right on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.988" offset="4043316">For example, in this community WTTG's local programming is 30%.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.748" offset="4070379">It's a non-network station that devotes 30% of its time and you're quite right, Mr. Justice Stewart that that is a very, very important one since the local -- since the non-network station is bound to devote more time to local programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.826" offset="4130670">The second, the Commission found that again, it would not be in the public interest because CATV was a former pay TV and there are people who are too poor in these ghettos and other places to afford it so that some people would not be getting the independent service at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.561" offset="4197648">And finally, the people who were living in the outlying areas, in the rural areas, surround these towns like Sacramento and San Diego, Philadelphia, they also would not be getting service, the independent service, because the CATV would not go out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.811" offset="4254595">Now, to deal with this problem in the Second Report, the Commission developed its major market policy and that policy states that in the top 100 markets where independent UHF Television was most likely to develop, the CATV system which propose to commence operation with distant signals, that signals carried beyond their Grade B contour which is normally the furthest point of acceptable service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.797" offset="4370578">That any CATV proposing to begin operation with such signals should not do so before the Commission in an evidentiary hearing had established that that would be consistent with the public interest with UHF Broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.249" offset="4432332">The Commission felt this was a reasonable way to proceed because it was trying to get the facts in depth as the CATV penetration and other factors and it was trying to get them before it was too late before the CATV would become entrenched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.813" offset="4498578">This main rule is in 1107 of the Commission's rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.016" offset="4519476">Another rule, 1109 is the one that's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.646" offset="4537971">The Commission found that you could get exactly the same public interest question raised even though a signal was not being carried beyond its Grade B contour and this is the so-called “area of overlapping B contours”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.040" offset="4587499">And I think I can illustrate it best by Baltimore, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.161" offset="4604008">The Washington stations place a Grade B signal over Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.426" offset="4621040">But they are not watched to any great extent in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.611" offset="4633788">People in Baltimore tend to watch the much stronger Baltimore signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.064" offset="4651656">But if you have a CATV operating in Baltimore and it is carrying these Washington signals, it makes the signals exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.174" offset="4684048">It strengthens them and now there's no difference at all technically between Washington and Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.499" offset="4705364">So, you have the three Washington independents being brought into Baltimore and you have the exactly the same public interest question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.527" offset="4733471">What's the effect of that under the development of the Baltimore UHF station?</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.218" offset="4752280">Now, the Commission said it would treat this problem when it arose under petition, bringing it to its attention under 1109 and would hold the same evidentiary hearing before the commencement of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.994" offset="4799300">Now, there is one other facet of 1109 that's applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.893" offset="4814973">The Commission grant brought it in all the existing stations, all existing systems, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.494" offset="4837334">But if a system had just gotten under way and had just a few 100 subscribers, it clearly shouldn't grow from these few hundred to hundreds of thousands throughout the entire community until there had been a resolution of the same public interest question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.494" offset="4905357">And so, it set again that when this was brought to its attention under 1109, it would hold the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.286" offset="4932524">And since that hearing is a complex economic one that would take considerable time, the Commission also said that it would consider on the pleadings awarding interim relief, holding the status quo because if the systems continue to grow while the hearing was going on, the Commission could be met by entrenchment and the Commission stressed throughout all these rules that once a CATV becomes entrenched, it cannot roll back the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.237" offset="5032312">It cannot let the service get dug in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.997" offset="5043388">The people get to rely upon it and then try to yank it out wires and all, it's just not practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.612" offset="5065853">Now, those are the policies that are involved here and they are specifically applicable to San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.970" offset="5095215">In San Diego, what is happening is that from a 120 miles away, the Los Angeles signals are being brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.699" offset="5130219">There is plenty of service here in San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.535" offset="5145475">There are all of the networks on VHF, one from T1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.532" offset="5161462">There is a UHF station that's independent that's gone on the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.580" offset="5177657">There's a UHF permittee that has been granted and it has not yet on the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.833" offset="5198660">There's also a UHF educational station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.482" offset="5213288">The CATV's have just gotten underway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.137" offset="5223946">A number of them, some of them begun in '63 but the penetration is very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.645" offset="5245994">It is only 4.6% of the homes is the Grade A area, that is an area going out about 35 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.972" offset="5275251">But the potential for CATV was very large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.832" offset="5290715">It was 78% to 90% of the homes in that area and there was a fairly rapid rate to growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.842" offset="5318719">So that the Commission said here is a classic case for the application of our major market policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.648" offset="5341915">They're bringing in the Los Angeles signals that aren't viewed any great extent without CATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.690" offset="5362082">They, therefore, designated the matter for evidentiary hearing and then they turned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.020" offset="5379427">And on the pleadings, the Commission turned to see how since they are holding an evidentiary hearing, how could they limit the growths.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.815" offset="5410670">And looking at it, the Commission found that there are eight discreet islands of CATV activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.026" offset="5551522">And this in effect allowed the Commission to be able to still make any decision they wanted to at the end of the hearing because it prevented the kind of all-out entrenchment, all-out growths that would have made the -- frustrated the very purpose of the hearing.</text>
