            <text syncTime="8.196" offset="136129">Mr. Werchick.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arne Werchick</label>
            <text syncTime="9.351" offset="140727">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.555" offset="153579">This action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act was halted in its infancy when summary judgment was granted against petitioner in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.998" offset="191404">The judgment was granted in favor of respondent Pacific Fruit Express, the District Court saying that respondent was not a common carrier by railroad and therefore not under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.499" offset="237380">The Ninth Circuit affirmed this judgment explicitly construing the coverage of the Act narrowly and stating so in its opinion, briefed opinion as specifically rejecting what it termed a broader definition of the terms of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.178" offset="296103">This Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.403" offset="304985">The issue essentially before this Court is the question of coverage under the Employers' Liability Act and whether it is to be decided as this Court has approached similar questions of coverage and also the general application of this Act in the past or whether the question of coverage is to be given a new and narrow technical meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.365" offset="388786">Facts of this suit as it come to this Court are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.508" offset="409370">It is essentially conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.222" offset="416266">The petitioner was employed by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.126" offset="423894">He was injured on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.266" offset="428387">He was working in Roseville, California on the yards of the -- that are operated by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.840" offset="450748">It is a large refrigerator car icing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.171" offset="472064">The facts, of course, describing the specifics of the operation are set out in great detail on the record on the briefs and I will refer to some of them as I proceed, but I don't think it's necessary to take the Court's time to set out all of the facts relating to the description of respondent's operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.560" offset="541654">Sufficed to say at this point that it is not disputed, in fact it is set forth in respondent's affidavit in the record that petitioner's job involved the servicing of railroad, refrigerator boxcars, placing of ice, loading and unloading of ice and heaters, and other equipment in and out of refrigerator boxcars, for the purpose of making these boxcars able to carry perishable commodities in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.040" offset="643532">And about this, it does not seem to be any dispute in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.019" offset="671431">Regarding this -- the factual description of Pacific Fruit Express, there is also very little disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.990" offset="695359">The disagreement between the parties here before this Court seems to be the conclusion to be drawn from this description.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.090" offset="727751">Respondent is described with partial accuracy as a refrigerator car company.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.196" offset="748126">And by the Interstate Commerce Commission statistical reports with also -- with partial accuracy as a private car line.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.660" offset="781981">Respondent is owned wholly by two rail haul lines, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.762" offset="806431">In fact, it is more than a car company because it owns some roughly 25,000 boxcars, refrigerator boxcars and is the largest owner and operator of these cars in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.963" offset="859199">It dominates what might be called the refrigerator car company industry or branch of the railroad industry if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.972" offset="891277">It represents basically half of that industry in terms of the number of employees, its holding in refrigerator cars alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.088" offset="923773">There are seven such companies in the United States, all of them owned by rail haul carriers and operated to service.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.107" offset="955852">The obligations of those rail haul carriers that they're required by law to provide the care necessary to ship perishables by railroad in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.225" offset="1004231">There are about one million carloads of perishable commodities shipped in the United States each year and respondent in their words originates and otherwise handles about 285,000 carloads, or approximately almost 30% of the nation's total.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.054" offset="1071626">Respondent describes itself in this record as in materials in this record as the nation's largest operator of refrigerator railcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.030" offset="1111542">And in 1965, PFE cars moved over one billion miles.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="262.172" offset="1152084">Who services the cars themselves?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="264.318" stopTime="377.262">
            <label>Mr. Arne Werchick</label>
            <text syncTime="264.318" offset="1160652">In this instance, Pacific Fruit Express services its own cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.296" offset="1176534">And servicing consists -- before the trip begins, Mr. Chief Justice, taking a car and making it ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.443" offset="1205164">In fact Pacific Fruit Express builds the car in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.896" offset="1222928">Maintains the car as required by law to keep its cars in condition to comply with the Federal Safety Appliance Acts, which it does sometimes itself and sometimes by paying another railcar repair installation to do the work for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.666" offset="1282069">Pacific Fruit Express takes the car and prepares it for service by cleaning it, by taking it to its various plants located in different parts of the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.556" offset="1317595">Seven, I think it is major plants and several icing stations different points in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.919" offset="1339016">And then places the necessary refrigerator or heater equipment in this car and then makes it available to a line haul railroad so that it can be taken out in commodities loaded in.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.151" offset="1388022">And now this is not where the service stops however because, Pacific Fruit Express is paid by the mile that the car is used and provides continuous service over this car putting ice in it wherever needed at its various stations across the United States or altering the character of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.050" offset="1467538">The shipper may call Pacific Fruit Express directly to alter the character of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.411" offset="1489063">They invite this in their advertising literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.776" offset="1498467">They list in the telephone directories.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.346" offset="1508707">And Pacific Fruit Express keeps their cars spotted all the way across the United States and can order them diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.293" offset="1532531">The shipper request this, nor sent to Chicago and if the shipper wants it to go to Los Angeles instead, the shipper is invited to call PFE.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.695" offset="1570147">It is not told to call the line -- haul line necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.413" offset="1581014">He can call either, and PFE will have that car diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.286" offset="1596479">They give the necessary instruction and the car will be diverted.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="377.262" offset="1612466">Who makes the necessary repairs to the car?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arne_werchick" startTime="380.739" stopTime="535.134">
            <label>Mr. Arne Werchick</label>
            <text syncTime="380.739" offset="1626363">Pacific Fruit Express maintains several repair shops of its own, in which it repairs its own cars and cars of other car companies, rail companies, and the like if paid the standard rates set by the American Association of Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.392" offset="1692923">They will also, if their car happens to be located in an area which is not near one of their own shops but requires repairs, pay the standard rates to another railroad company or repair company to do the repairs in their shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.090" offset="1755721">As it can be seen from the record, Pacific Fruit Express not only owns but controls, operates, and services this largest freight of refrigerator railcars and trailers in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.698" offset="1810160">Their business revolves around the roughly 25,000 cars that it owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.227" offset="1832312">But according to the Interstate Commerce Commission Reports which we've cited in our brief, Pacific Fruit Express also rents cars from Southern Pacific and Union Pacific to add to its fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.700" offset="1878183">Now Pacific Fruit Express, as I indicated, places these cars in rail service by providing them to any line haul railroad in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.284" offset="1912560">They are not private contract line had dealing only with say one carrier, one other carrier being completely subsumed to one part of the business, but rather will deal with any part of the public and any part of the railroad community, and making their cars available and in providing protective services.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.011" offset="1983404">They do this by charging approximately 5 cents per mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.875" offset="1998869">They do not charge, with very rare exception, for term use of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.317" offset="2020603">Occasionally, according to their literature, they will rent some cars to a shipper on a monthly basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.803" offset="2042546">This is what I would call -- concede would be the renting or leasing of a refrigerator railcar.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.277" offset="2072430">But I would maintain that insofar as it is a standard in the refrigerator car business to charge by the mile that a car is used, this indicates a carriage activity that's going on a transportation activity, which as I would like to suggest later is crucial in applying with Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.256" offset="2152364">Pacific Fruit Express does more in controlling the distribution of the cars because they also do market research.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.087" offset="2179741">They also go out and survey the agricultural needs in the areas early in order to determine how many cars will be needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.902" offset="2214954">They discuss with shippers where cars have to be provided and where they'll be needed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.552" offset="8513599">In Wells Fargo versus Taylor, unanimous opinion of this Court, it was held that an express company employee did not come within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.767" offset="8550484">So far as the question of freight forwarders, Mr. Justice White, that was decided in the case of Lafsco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.815" offset="8578591">I don't remember the name of the defendant therein but it appears in our brief and it was specifically held that freight forwarders do not come within the Act because they are not common carriers by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.927" offset="8623104">Now what I'd like to do at this point is to go through very briefly the legislative and judicial history so that you can see that this Act was intended for operational railroads in the sense that we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.423" offset="8685066">The Act was first passed in 1906 and it was held unconstitutional, because at that time, the first Act and I believe this is very important said this, “That this Act shall apply to every common carrier engaged in trade or commerce”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.676" offset="8754030">In 1908, this Court held that that first Employers' Liability Act was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.713" offset="8782242">And one of the things this Court pointed out was it applies to too many companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.689" offset="8806170">It applies not only to railroads but ferries, bridges and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.846" offset="8826755">And that's -- so the Court held that unconstitutional.Congress cited the Court's opinion in the first Employers' Liability Act case in their reports and then amended the statute to say it applies only to common carriers by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.136" offset="8899897">This Court then had brought before it the second Employers' Liability Act case in 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.589" offset="8929677">And at that time, this Court said, "Yes, it only means common carriers by railroad".</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.549" offset="8961546">And they referred to the first Act which was held unconstitutional which went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.060" offset="8983594">Now after that second Employer's Liability Act case in 1912, there was the Baltimore &amp; Ohio case, the Robinson case, wherein this Court said it doesn't apply to porters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.413" offset="9041063">There was the Wells Fargo versus Taylor where it said it doesn't apply to express company employees even though they may be working on trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.704" offset="9078157">Then there was a trilogy of cases which are very important under the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.414" offset="9097070">And on this subject Mr. Justice Brennan, this company is not controlled or answerable to the Interstate Commerce Commission except that it has under a 1940 amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, it has to supply uniform accounting method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.252" offset="9180348">That's the only control that the Interstate Commerce Commission has over refrigerator car companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2753.237" offset="11116335">After these refrigerator car companies cases in around 1920, this Court held in a unanimous opinion that in three refrigerator car cases which I have cited, that they are not common carriers by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.738" offset="11190314">Congress must have known of these cases because they had great impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.968" offset="11211212">The Interstate Commerce Act was amended in part as a result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.008" offset="11235453">Now with the knowledge of this Court's unanimous holding in three refrigerator car cases and in the other two cases I mentioned, in the decade of the 30s, there was a lot of railway legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.689" offset="11294177">I've cited in page 15 of my brief seven laws that got passed or amended and in every law from 1934 to 1939, they specifically included refrigerator car companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.180" offset="11364080">And the most notable example was the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.160" offset="11379963">The Railway Labor Act in 1934 was amended to include refrigerator car companies because they had never come under the Act before and Congress wanted them under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.988" offset="11419355">And Congress was aware of these prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.918" offset="11435029">So they amended the Railway Unemployment Insurance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.153" offset="11435969">They amended the Railroad Retirement Act three times to bring them in within its coverage.And then in 1939 they had hearings set out on page 14 of my brief when they gave specific determination whether they should extend the Federal Employers' Liability Act to include lesser companies other than common carriers by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.456" offset="11541191">There was specific discussion on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.249" offset="11552371">And Congress specifically decided not to extend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.973" offset="11567313">And the only railway Act that I know that doesn't include refrigerator car companies is the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arne Werchick</label>
            <text syncTime="3387.391" offset="13652929">I'd start to point out that under California Public Utilities Code 211 which is cited in our brief, the word common carrier under California law specifically includes refrigerator and car renting corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.994" offset="13707368">Secondly, the question of Federal Safety Appliance Act, the Safety Appliance Act is directed to the vehicles themselves, to the instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.961" offset="13735267">In your decision of the United States versus California, this Court said, it could go after the belt line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.747" offset="13758360">It didn't have to wait until it got on to a full line haul railroad in order to enforce that Act in considering that decision at its narrowest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.684" offset="13786154">It stands for the proposition that the holder of the vehicle and anytime that somebody is injured, or anytime the unsafe practices found is the person responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.194" offset="13824188">This is perhaps the most aptly illustrated in the Florida case that I mentioned earlier, McCullough versus Jacksonville Terminal also cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.973" offset="13851251">There, the terminal company did nothing with the car except clean it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.749" offset="13866402">They moved it for the purpose of servicing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.997" offset="13875388">It was defective under the Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.095" offset="13883747">Suit was brought under the vehicle of the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.661" offset="13893987">And recovery was allowed even though there was no transportation involved in that sense, merely the cleaning of the car making it ready for transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.152" offset="13932022">The question of what happens if the railroad divests was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.650" offset="13949994">Suppose it gives away what's -- we maintain is really what it's doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.244" offset="13964309">And this is answered in part or at least by analogy in Section 57 of Title 45 which is also part of the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.855" offset="13990745">And it says that a common carrier for the purpose of that Act is anybody, a receiver or a lessee or anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.234" offset="14016345">It says carrying out the operations of a common carrier by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.753" offset="14030346">And that Section has never been used to decide a coverage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.001" offset="14043408">I might suggest in my mind that it might be perfectly adequate to decide coverage cases because it says anybody performing the function of a common carrier by railroad and it doesn't say a bit of the function of a whole function.</text>
