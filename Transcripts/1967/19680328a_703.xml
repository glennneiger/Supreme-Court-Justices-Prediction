            <label>Mr. Ira G. Rothgerber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="33.738" offset="238320">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.323" offset="260681">This writ reviews the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, affirming denial of habeas corpus to the petitioner who is a prisoner in the Oklahoma Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.289" offset="324524">It presents the Court a difference in attitudes if not an actual conflict between the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.955" offset="375202">The petitioner and three others were charged by information with robbery with firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.257" offset="428387">The date of the information is August 25, 1961, which was three days following a preliminary hearing to which I will presently refer.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.466" offset="501217">As a result of the information a good many months later, the petitioner was tried separately from his co-defendants and a transcript of the testimony of a co-defendant, Woods, given at a joint preliminary hearing which was held August 22, 1961, three days before the information was read to the jury over the objection of Woods’ -- of petitioner's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.292" offset="656488">Oklahoma has conceded in its brief that prior to the preliminary hearing, there was “apparently” an agreement between the prosecution and Woods, the co-defendant, and as a result of that apparent agreement, Woods was called by the prosecution at the preliminary hearing and gave testimony inculpating the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.815" offset="802670">At the preliminary hearing, both petitioner and Woods were represented by one retained attorney, a gentleman named Mr. Parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.020" offset="863483">Woods was called to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.653" offset="874036">He was admonished by his attorney that he need not to give evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.934" offset="899114">There was a recess in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.438" offset="913115">After the recess, Mr. Woods came back, Mr. Parks came back, withdrew as counsel for Woods and there upon, Woods gave his testimony which was significant in the conviction of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.877" offset="1002872">At the preliminary hearing, Mr. Parks did not cross-examine petitioner but it is only fair to say that petitioner was cross-examined by an attorney for another of those at that time jointly accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.011" offset="1095450">I will now relate a fact which is set forth in the Appendix to the petitioner's opening brief and which was not before the trial court or the Court of Appeals, but a fact which we ask this Court to notice in its supervisory capacity over United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.527" offset="1193462">On September 7, 1961, September 14, 1961, October 5, 1961 and October 6, 1961, Mr. Parks whom you will remember had withdrawn his appearance on behalf of Woods in the State Court preliminary hearing appeared as Mr. Woods' counsel in proceedings in the United States District Court in the northern district of Oklahoma, and on the last date mentioned, October 6, 1961, a sentence was imposed on Mr. Woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.076" offset="1351659">He was there upon taken to the penitentiary in Texarkana, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.421" offset="1397008">And on March 5, 1962 several months later, petitioner's trial commenced in the District Court in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mr. Parks was then representing the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.685" offset="1470151">The state offered a transcript of Woods' testimony at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.446" offset="1505155">Mr. Parks objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.730" offset="1518320">Mr. Parks in support of this objection made an offer of proof in which he stated that in fact, Mr. Woods was confined in the state penitentiary -- in federal penitentiary at Texarkana, Texas which is 200 and 300 miles from Tulsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.655" offset="1614033">The objection was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.067" offset="1619675">The transcript was read to the jury which brought in a verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.365" offset="1644857">The petitioner appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals which affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.249" offset="1680384">He then sought habeas corpus and after an intermediate step in which the Court of Appeals was not satisfied, he had exhausted his state remedies, it was determined that he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.237" offset="1736286">The Court of Appeals however has stated that there is no denial of the right of confrontation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.344" offset="1772753">This is the principal issue here, was the petitioner denied his right of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.282" offset="1816534">Oklahoma asserts and this poses another important issue that by his inaction in failing to examine Woods at the preliminary hearing, Mr. Parks on behalf of petitioner effectively waived the right of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.748" offset="1914337">Finally, we have what is probably a peripheral issue that naturally flows from this sequence of events and that is whether or not Mr. Parks effectively represented the petitioner in his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.122" offset="1999809">Judge Aldrich who is sitting with the Tenth Circuit by special designation dissented from the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.831" offset="2050696">Oklahoma's argument which I'm sure you will hear presently is that Mr. Parks' failure to cross-examine Woods at the preliminary hearing was a tactical decision and Oklahoma uses these words to characterize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.463" offset="2137213">It was a “decision to be ineffective”.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.510" offset="2161455">Oklahoma urges that a decision to be ineffective is binding on the petitioner as a waiver of the right of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.524" offset="2221432">In Pointer against Texas, the Court coupled the right to confrontation with the right to cross-examination saying that they are essential and fundamental requirements for the kind of fair trial which is country's constitutional goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.398" offset="2321011">In Pointer against Texas, Mr. Pointer had no counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.812" offset="2350582">The petitioner's counsel at no time either at the preliminary hearing or any other time, cross-examined the co-defendant, of course he couldn't because the co-defendant was not at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.198" offset="2416201">The Court of Appeals said, it is not necessary for a state to go to a federal court and seek a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum which the Court of Appeals characterized as a quasi writ and have it denied prior to introducing a transcript of the testimony at a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.294" offset="2536573">The Court of Appeals while not using the word waiver, it characterized Mr. Parks' inaction, his failure to cross-examine Woods at the preliminary hearing as though it were wavered.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.639" offset="2653915">In Pointer against Texas, the Court said that nothing in the case was contrary to the old case of Mattox against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.342" offset="2716714">In Mattox, the transcript which was read had been the subject of thorough and grilling cross-examination at the first trial of Mattox.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.437" offset="2785155">We come then to the difference in attitude, what is the burden to be cast on the prosecution, whether it is a state court or a federal prosecution, in bringing forth a witness who is easily attainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.759" offset="2870418">Oklahoma has said in its brief that they were not referred to any statute or any case law which indicated that the state had any burden or that it even was possible for the states to produce a federal prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.289" offset="2964564">We have, in our reply brief, referred the Court to the statute which provides for federal writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.800" offset="3034572">We did not in either brief called the court's attention Ponzi against Fessenden, 258 US 254 in which the Court recognized that the Attorney General of the United States has the power, the authority to exercise the comity which is inherent in two competing legal systems which compete in the same jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.454" offset="3185142">The square collision, if it is that, between the Circuits is best found in a decision of the Third Circuit, Government of the Virgin Islands versus Aquino which held that as a predicate to introduction of the testimony of the absent witness unavailable, they must be shown both to satisfy the constitutional requirement of confrontation and the evidentiary requirement of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.806" offset="3350549">In Virgin Islands against Aquino, there was a rape prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.247" offset="3376358">The prosecutrix was a stewardess on a Norwegian ship as I recall it and at the trial, her testimony at the preliminary hearing was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.027" offset="3451486">It was submitted in the Court of Appeals, the Third Circuit reversed and laid down this test which I submit is contrary to the casual test [Inaudible] indeed and adopted by the Court of Appeals, the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.439" offset="3525151">This is what the Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.389" offset="3540929">“The reasonableness of efforts to secure attendance in the Virgin Islands of a witness whether he is in another state of the union or in a foreign country must be judged of the standards of modern air travel and not of the sailing vessel or even the steam ship where the liberty of the defendant is at stake, the government which prosecutes him may not secure the benefit of incriminating testimony against him unless it shows its genuine and bona fide effort to secure the attendance of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.255" offset="3704351">An effort which expires of the shoreline of Virgin Islands cannot be said to have inherently in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.545" offset="3733504">The proof of its genuineness and its bona fide character.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.574" offset="3757641">No effort can be deemed genuine and bona fide which is not reasonable in its extent and reasonableness must be judged not by artificial boundaries, but by limitations of time and distance.”</text>

            <text syncTime="950.971" offset="3907271">The Fifth Circuit also has differed from the Tenth Circuit's casual test in Holman against Washington which is also referred to in our brief, it is cited 364 F.2nd 618, where the Court took note that compulsory process is not the only method of securing attendance of witnesses and said that the right of confrontation is too valuable right to be sacrificed for the convenience of a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.308" offset="4076648">Oklahoma has replied relying principally on the Ninth Circuit case of Wilson against Gray, 345 F.2nd 287 that the lawyer is the manager of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.330" offset="4136730">He makes the tactical determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.715" offset="4150209">The tactical determination is binding upon his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.304" offset="4196603">Parks' conduct in his representation of petitioner so taints that representation that it is doubtful that under the standards of Brookhart against Janis, he effectively could waive the petitioner's right of confrontation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1470.510" offset="5985364">The essence of course is, what is the requirement upon a state to introduce any former testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.987" offset="6035310">As has been pointed out by Mr. Justice Fortas, perhaps the rule can be if there were a former full pledged trial and in Pointer against Texas, the Court talked about a full pledged hearing and I think the only reason that we tend to dwell on the nature of the preliminary hearing is that that's just what the problem was in Pointer against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.693" offset="6142098">That was a preliminary hearing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.889" offset="6158921">But if the Court were to say no testimony of a preliminary hearing -- at a preliminary hearing may ever be introduced then of course we have an ideal result from Mr. Barber's point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.399" offset="6220988">In Douglas against Alabama which was decided the same day as Pointer against Texas, the Court talked about waiver in that case also and restricted its discussion there to the circumstances of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.757" offset="6306356">This is a third possible result for petitioner here and its one of the reasons as I talked, as I did about his counsel's conduct and that is to restrict the decision here to the circumstance of this case and say that in all of the circumstances of this case there was not an untainted waiver of petitioner's right of confrontation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.953" offset="6507186">I would like to make just two observations at the onset as two of counsel's observations concerning certain language in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.850" offset="6554728">He first of all states that the respondent concedes that after -- that prior to the time that Woods testified at preliminary hearing, there was an agreement of some sort made between the prosecution and Woods that Woods would testify for the state in return for something we don't know exactly what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.880" offset="6674892">We don't concede this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.169" offset="6680012">We point this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.157" offset="6687953">We just state this as a statement of facts to use the word concede seems to indicate that we well to intimate that there is something inherently wrong with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.024" offset="6747512">I suggest that there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.569" offset="6757648">It's a very common occurrence for the prosecution and for the government or the state to make an agreement with a co-defendant to testify, indicates that that's the only way possible that you can have a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.822" offset="6822640">So we don't -- we suggest that there's nothing wrong with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.515" offset="6845419">Secondly, we perhaps used some inappropriate language in our brief as the counsel notes that we say that it could be at parts where it was ineffective then it's because he chose to be ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.173" offset="6900067">We meant of course that if this could be construed to be ineffective, his waiver of the cross-examination then of course he was ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.899" offset="6946983">Also at the outset, I would like to make some concessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.002" offset="6991391">First of all, this is a rather unique question as this Court realizes, otherwise I would not be here I'm sure, not that the question of confrontation of witnesses as unique with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.955" offset="7043218">You had it before you on several occasions and not this precise question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.362" offset="7064848">At first glance, I think this seems rather strange that this is a rather unique question because the right of confrontation is so very basic and fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.088" offset="7123675">But I think when you consider it briefly, you'll understand why, I understand why and that's because the states and the government, prosecutions for the state and the United States government recognize that this is a very basic and fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.141" offset="7199953">Consequently there are very few times in which the occasion arises that an accused will not be confronted at trial by the face-to-face by the witnesses against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3100.179" offset="12504064">That is my point, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.351" offset="12524753">I would like to address myself to the second contention of counsel as I read his brief and as I listened to his argument and that is that counsel cannot waive his right of confrontation for his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.694" offset="12610121">And I suggest in our brief that this is not like some rights that counsel cannot waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.954" offset="12639169">This is more in the nature of a tactical decision on the part of the counsel as the manager of his client's lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.922" offset="12675009">I think the very reason that an accused must have counsel is the reason that he must exercise certain decisions as this, whether to cross-examine a witness or things in that nature are purely tactical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.274" offset="12744495">As I suggested before, his strategy in this particular case maybe to not cross-examine because he does not want to show his hand at that stage of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.907" offset="12799039">I don't think the defendant can later complain that he didn't personally authorize his attorney to waive the right of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.018" offset="12859434">To indulge in this reasoning would be to make any criminal prosecution endless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.543" offset="12897573">There will always be a question of, if counsel have done this or have not done this at trial, perhaps, that would have been a different result, but this is not the test of effective counsel which the counsel also raises here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.009" offset="12967372">The test is not whether by hindsight, we can examine the record and conclude that a different procedure might have resulted and brought about a different result, a more favorable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.861" offset="13038843">Again, I think the very reason that he is entitled to counsel to represent him at every stage of the criminal process is the reason that the same counsel must be given the right to make certain waivers or to exercise his discretion as to tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.485" offset="13125360">I would suggest in conclusion that this Court has stated on occasion that certainly, rights such as the right of confrontation of witnesses is a basic right, but you have also stated and I'd like to quote a certain language from the case of Mattox versus United States which is the case that is cited by Mr. Justice Black in the Pointer case in which he said that general rules of law of this kind are ever beneficent in their operation and valuable to the accused must occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.836" offset="13322742">The law in its wisdom declares that the rights of the public shall not be wholly sacrificed in order that an incidental benefit maybe preserved to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.671" offset="13370075">I suggest that this was one of those cases where the petitioner was denied face-to-face confrontation at the trial, but he had been once given confrontation at a preliminary hearing where he had been represented by the counsel who had been afforded the opportunity to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.069" offset="13459623">I think this is all that the Pointer requires and I think Pointer should be limited to its particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.147" offset="13491911">If there are no questions, that's all my presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.772" offset="13502464">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.269" offset="13540498">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.205" offset="13556172">Mr. Chief Justice inquired as to the chronology of events concerning the turnover of Mr. Woods to the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.168" offset="13612074">The chronology appears very clearly in Appendix A to the petitioner's brief in the form of a letter from the clerk reciting what happened, including the date on October 6, 1961 when he was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.028" offset="13723460">Oklahoma itself has foreseen the danger of the interplay between prosecution authorities and one defendant with the resultant danger that somebody might be sent away and made unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.173" offset="13836100">The case is Caide (ph) against State, 83 F.2nd 605 from which we quote at page 16 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.818" offset="13906631">Oklahoma recognized that there must be a showing of diligence and as Mr. Justice Harlan said, isn't the narrow question here, assuming for the moment that the Court does not rule that at no time can transcript of a preliminary hearing be introduced, then the next question becomes as suggested, what is the degree of diligence required of the prosecution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.974" offset="14027316">In summary, I suggest the rule of diligence is not the casual rule about the Tenth Circuit but at least some diligence as commanded by the Third Circuit in the Government of Virgin Islands against Aquino.</text>
