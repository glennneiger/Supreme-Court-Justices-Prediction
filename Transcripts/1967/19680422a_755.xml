            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 755, First Agricultural National Bank of Berkshire County, appellant versus State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.573" offset="241664">Mr. Kessel, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_h_kessel" startTime="38.362" stopTime="495.845">
            <label>Mr. Ronald H. Kessel</label>
            <text syncTime="38.362" offset="256815">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.834" offset="274683">The appellant, the First Agricultural National Bank of Berkshire County is a national bank chartered under Title 12, the United States Code as such just one of 19 national banks conducting banking operations in the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.319" offset="336645">For over two years, it has paid under protest, Massachusetts sales and use taxes on purchases of tangible personal property for its own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.156" offset="380008">Immediately prior to the enactment of the sales and use tax statute of the appellant request of the appellee, the State Tax Commission, for a ruling or an emergency regulation that it was exempt from these taxes, no such ruling was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.559" offset="449599">However, emergency regulation number 6 was promulgated which stated that the sales lease or rental of tangible personal property of the national banks and to Federal Savings and Home Loan Associations was subject to the sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.670" offset="522010">The appellant filed a fail for declaratory release seeking in substance that it was exempt from these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.613" offset="557850">The case was reserved and reported without decision to the Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the issues which are raised on this appeal were passed on by that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.447" offset="609155">There are five issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.744" offset="618350">Two of them relate to the nature of the Massachusetts sales tax and one of the natures of that tax is probably reviewable by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.163" offset="651995">Three of them relate to the tax immune status of the national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.465" offset="673207">The third -- the first is whether Section 548 of Title 12 prohibits the imposition of a sales and use tax on purchases by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.302" offset="716570">If this Court should decide that issue affirmative why then none of the other tax immunity issues need be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.272" offset="752410">If, however, this Court should decide as the appellant submits it should not, that Section 548 is a purely permissive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.510" offset="793370">Why then the second immunity issue is raised, that is whether after long standing congressional reliance and acceptance of the decisions of this Court which have held at a several states are wholly without power to levy any tax direct or indirect on national banks except as Congress permits, whether those decisions should be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.314" offset="900577">Only if this Court should decide that these decisions should be sole reexamined is the pure constitution -- constitutional issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.988" offset="935372">That is whether national banks, the federal instrumentalities should continue to enjoy the constitutional protection from state taxation, again, except this Congress permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.145" offset="983960">Inherent in the nature of our federalism, is a necessity of accommodating the affairs of the nation and the power of the several states to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.244" offset="1020322">Congress is fashioned its accommodation in Section 548.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.833" offset="1042683">Section 548 provides that the several states can levy taxes on national bank shares, dividends there from and on the income of national banks and taxes measured by a recording the income of these banks in addition to real estate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.233" offset="1124289">Section 548 does not permit the levying of a sales and use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.596" offset="1145710">Despite the language of Section 548 and despite the overwhelming authority of the decisions of this Court, the appellee now urges upon this Court that the appellant is subject to state sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.262" offset="1224391">The original predecessor to Section 548 was enacted in 1864, one year after the National Banking System was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.520" offset="1261484">The debates prior to the enactment of this section indicate that the Congress was well aware that it was making a decision into determining the sculpt of permissible state taxation of national banks which was a purely legislative market and was not one of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.746" offset="1338389">For example, one of the objects of the 1864 Legislation was to encourage the conversion of not state banks international banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.555" offset="1373602">Congress knew that any types of protection for the national banks would encourage such conversions.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.821" offset="1402650">This objective is of course one of legislator policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.925" offset="1423026">The congressional debates further indicate that the Congress is well aware of the decision of the McCulloch versus Maryland and of the constitutional provision against a tax on national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.913" offset="1486973">For this reason, we're fully conscious that in setting forth the permissible mode of state taxation they were determining the outer limits beyond which the state could not tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.822" offset="1546637">Subsequent legislative activity with respect to Section 548 confirms this.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.552" offset="1577566">In 1923, an amendment was enacted which permitted the several states to tax the dividends and the income of national banks</text>
            <text syncTime="379.249" offset="1620407">The original predecessor had only permitted the taxation of national bank shares in real estate -- in the real estate of the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.686" offset="1650082">In 1926, the amendment was passed which authorized the states to levy excise and franchise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.991" offset="1683310">In 1935, the Congress subjected national banks to state unemployment taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.638" offset="1705880">In short, Congress has always seen fit to carefully define the precise scope of state taxation of these banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.783" offset="1742555">It has never seen to authorize and subject the national banks to general state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.337" offset="1796681">In 1950, the Congress rejected a bill which would have expressly authorized the taxation of the purchases of national banks under state sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.251" offset="1852374">This bill never became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.665" offset="1866062">The decision below is in effect an attempt to resurrect and judicially enact that bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.824" offset="1898663">In so doing the court below relied on the cannon of construction that tax immunity is not to be granted by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.389" offset="1928965">But the case has relied on or in opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.204" offset="1940146">Either they are not cases of statutory construction or they aren't cases where a statutory immunity was conferred, a limited immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.371" offset="1976822">And the issue was whether that immunity should be extended by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.613" offset="1997824">The issue on this appeal is a far different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.380" offset="2012871">It is a question of whether the Congress by expressly authorizing four casually defined methods of taxation, intended that other such methods of taxation should be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.185" offset="2068146">Moreover, resort to that judicial kind of construction --</text>

            <text syncTime="662.175" offset="2752031">And Congress can prohibit the taxation of national banks as it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.740" offset="2782333">The Court, as I mentioned, relied on this cannon of construction that immunity is not to be extended by implication as we suggest the cases are in opposite and they do not present a statute where four carefully defined modes were permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.687" offset="2854118">The effect of the decision below is this, by utilizing that cannon of construction, it would require an expressed provision in Section 548.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.596" offset="2897795">But the requirement of an expressed provision in Section 548 is exactly what this Court in its decisions has made superfluous and this approaches judicial legislation in the form of judicial construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.871" offset="2962892">The analysis is somewhat disturbing.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.701" offset="2970206">The result is we submitted even more so.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.040" offset="2983581">Now, under Section 548, if a statement of levy one of the four permissible taxes, why would have to make some very complicated criteria relating to whether it was taxing at a rate higher than or rate of money capital in the hands of individuals and several others.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.280" offset="3060485">But now according to the Court and its interpretation, the several states could levy in numerable other taxes without having to meet a complex set of criteria which Congress has enacted in the case of Section 548.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.816" offset="3118686">Moreover, under Section 548 if you choose one of the four permissible modes, you cannot tax on any or the other three ways that provides other tax in either one of the fours in lieu of all the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.758" offset="3162363">But now again if the Court's interpretation, the Massachusetts's Court interpretation is -- is accepted why the states would be free to again impose many other forms of state taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.238" offset="3464338">The reason for that first sentence which would seem to indicate that all of the Section 548 I was talking about on national bank shares is a really historical vestige.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.818" offset="3506657">In 1864, when the original statute was passed why it permitted only the taxation of national bank shares and that first sentence says, “Come down through the century and the amendments authorizing the taxation of national bank income and authorizing excise of franchise taxes which is added as later sentences.”</text>
            <text syncTime="870.237" offset="3584293">But I certainly -- we strongly submit that Section 548 covers much more than the taxation of national bank shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.757" offset="3614386">Indeed it comprehensibly controls the entire scope of the national bank taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.160" offset="6112005">Perhaps the court below relied very heavily on what it assumed to be the case that is that there was no penalty on a vendor on failing to collect the tax from the purchaser.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.310" offset="6324642">And there was some ambiguity as to whether the reference to any provisions of this section meant the subsection or the section itself which was the entire Sales Tax Act that any ambiguity has been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.156" offset="6383992">After the decision by the court below, the Massachusetts Sales Tax Act became permanent law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1585.456" offset="6445223">And so the section which deals with the revocation and suspension of a vendor's registration states that a registration can be suspended or revoked for failure to comply with the provisions of any section of this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.542" offset="6517530">And so there are no longer is any ambiguity and there clearly is within the statute of penalty for a vendor's failure to collect the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.131" offset="7699937">As for the uniform currency, the Second Bank of the United States having gone out of existence when its charter expired in 1836 there was no federally chartered bankin existence thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.717" offset="7934203">Prior to the Civil War, the number of state bank notes ran into to thousands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.941" offset="7971088">They varied in value from state to state and within the same state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.312" offset="8004629">Counterfeiting of the notes was widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.275" offset="8024482">So much so that counterfeiting had almost become a hobby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.321" offset="8048619">No business or financial institution could then function without what was then known as a counterfeit detective in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.738" offset="8094281">State bank notes were known via some other colorful terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.453" offset="8117164">There were the shinplasters of Michigan and the red dogs of Indiana and Nebraska, the wild cats of Georgia and Pennsylvania and the stump-tails of Illinois and Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.692" offset="8178186">So serious was the irregularity in the bank note system that demands the reform came from many sources, chief of whom, at that time was Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.930" offset="8271078">When December of 1861 and a message to Congress urged a replacement of the state bank notes by a uniform federal bank note currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.882" offset="8346937">He got no immediate results but as the finances of the north worsen during the Civil War and it became necessary to enlarge the market for the government bonds then issued or to be issued by the north, a combination of Chase's objective and the fiscal needs of the Treasury were then joined so as to create what was known as the National Currency Act of 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.912" offset="8538990">Under this Act, five or more persons could organize what were known as National Banking Associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.329" offset="8596668">By depositing with the treasurer or the comptroller of the currency, certain government bonds to hold a security for the issuance of bank notes which would then be entitled to qualify as legal tender throughout the country, the bonds which are eligible for deposit were said or since said to have had was known as the circulation privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.780" offset="8758523">The National Currency Act was amended and replaced in 1864 but without significant change in the essential characteristic that it originally had namely the issuance of a bond secured currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.671" offset="8886105">Now, the national bank currency thereafter had an interesting and not very edifying history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.940" offset="8943156">Much has been written about its defects, chief of which was its so-called inelasticity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.688" offset="8978160">That is, its inability to expand or contract according to the needs of business and agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.196" offset="9016195">When time look good, the banks consider buying more bonds as a base for augmenting the bank note issue would put their money to other purposes so that at the very time that an augmented currency was needed to meet the expense -- expanding demands of industry and agriculture, the currency was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.192" offset="9140120">Although it might be an overstatement to say that this inelasticity brought on the panics of 1873 or 1884 or 1903 or 1893 or 1907, I think it is fair to say reading from his financial historians that the national bank note currency due to its inelasticity and it was also sometimes called its reversed elasticity seriously intensified the crisis and the money panics once they had started.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.663" offset="9298004">After the panic of 1907, country had just about had enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.705" offset="9330186">In that year the National Monetary Commission was established and in a series of studies which number over 20 volumes made an intensive study of banking practices both here and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.640" offset="9425899">Commission filed its report in 1912, finding many inadequacies in the existing banking structure of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.276" offset="9484518">Many of which of course had often been noted the immobility of reserves, scattering of reserves, the lack of any centralized control over reserve -- banking reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.265" offset="9552436">But among the chief defects found in the existing banking system was the national bank note currency which was indicted by the National Monetary Commission or its inelasticity as I have just described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.014" offset="9639476">The result of course of the National Monetary Commission's work was the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.510" offset="9685452">Worth not for the threat and danger causing a serious loss on the bonds that have the circulation privilege, the Federal Reserve Act would have abolished the national bank notes in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.539" offset="9773537">As it was, the Federal Reserve Act of course created a new form of bank note currency with greater elasticity Federal Reserve notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.263" offset="9812407">It was anticipated, however, that the national bank notes would be retired in due course and indeed in 1935 they were so retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.454" offset="9857233">When the Secretary of the Treasury called in for redemption, all bonds then possessing the circulation privilege, the result was that from 1935 on national banks have seized to have their originally distinctive function namely the issuance of bank notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.817" offset="9970604">Any national bank notes now in circulation are simply those notes which have not been turned in for redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.912" offset="10015013">The -- if any distinction now exists between the national banks and the state banks, it is simply that they are each subject to different supervisory agencies and even the state banks today are subject to such a variety of federal controls that to speak of our dual banking system is it sometimes called -- is actually and is nowhere we have today Federal Reserve System, we have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the comptroller of the currency all exercising controls of various sorts of both the faith of the state as well it has of the federal banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.136" offset="12355897">No Your Honor, because they are specifically exempt by Act of Congress from state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.609" offset="12373765">The word of exemption is used in the Federal Reserve Act with respect to state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.976" offset="12399261">Our position here is that Section 548 does not speak in terms of an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.168" offset="12424025">It speaks wholly in terms of a regulation of the types of taxation enumerated in Section 548.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.763" offset="12462373">Now, may I say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.538" offset="12481494">When 548 was first passed which I took the form of proviso in Section 41 I believe it was of the Currency Act of 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.214" offset="12544188">It was cast in the form that it was I submit for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.050" offset="12575535">One was the nature of state taxation in those days and the other was the continuing vitality of an important reservation in McCulloch versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.968" offset="12627257">In 1864, the only type of state taxation of any consequence was the local property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.713" offset="12654216">So that when Congress adopted this proviso which was all that it was in 1864, it was thinking only in terms of the local property tax and I believe I've documented that statement in a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.618" offset="12753795">As for the reservation in McCulloch versus Maryland, there is an important statement in that case which I believe is often gone unnoticed where Chief Justice Marshall pointed out that nothing in that decision was to prevent local taxation of the property of national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.995" offset="12911365">And may I say this -- I should say -- no I shouldn't say national banks, I should say the Second Bank of the United States which was a true federal instrumentality certainly significantly different from the national banks as we know them today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.443" offset="12973119">And may I say this further with respect to McCulloch versus Maryland because I think this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.483" offset="13005302">The reference to which that case is given -- which is given to that case is based on the centrally -- because of its enunciation of the implied powers doctrine and doctrine of the supremacy of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.416" offset="13113031">In the course of that opinion, Chief Justice Marshall said that it wasn't even worth discussing whether or not the Second Bank of the United States was a true federal instrumentality because at that time, in view of its history and its functions, it was a true agent, fiscal agent of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.007" offset="13219401">And in Osborn against the Bank of the United States a few years later when factual examination of the Second Bank was considered more fully, Chief Justice Marshall again stated almost summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.394" offset="13328906">His words were that the banks exercise of these, its banking faculties greatly facilitates the fiscal operations of the Government is too obvious for controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.208" offset="13368195">Well it's not too obvious for controversy today Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.761" offset="13386376">It's an entirely different banking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.559" offset="13401631">It's an entirely different bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.600" offset="13413752">And as far as Section 548 is concerned, may I just point out this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.379" offset="13436844">This is not the first time, I'm sure it would be the last that a litigant has attempted to use the shield as a sword.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.923" offset="13475088">548, historically, was designed to prevent discrimination against the national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.385" offset="13500897">It was not designed to give the national banks a preference over their competitors, the state banks.</text>
