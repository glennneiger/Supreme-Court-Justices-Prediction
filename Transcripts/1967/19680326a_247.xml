            <text syncTime="1478.861" offset="6018800">The first is, that there in fact are numerous Indians who engage in the salt water fishery and in fact quite recently, the Bureau of Indians Affairs has obtained apparently the necessary appropriations and has purchased purse seine vessels for the Makah Tribes and the Makah Tribe is now going to be as a tribal operation, fishing commercial in the straits Juan de Fuca.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.699" offset="6126216">There are, as I mentioned, there are numerous Indians who do engage in the salt water fishery and there was certainly have no provisional limitation upon their ability to do so if they so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.987" offset="6163310">I think another point that should be called to the attention of the Court has to do with the value of the fish at the time or at the point of its migration where it's caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.121" offset="6199881">Now if you take a fish that's up near the spawning grounds, you've got a fish that is changed substantially in quality, deteriorated in quality from that same bright fish, which would be taken in the salt water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.229" offset="6256306">It has spent a great deal of its bodily energies in making its ascent or upstream migration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.961" offset="6283264">Its flesh, it's body oils have been expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.359" offset="6300818">It's flesh, rather than being firmed is soft and shrunky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.589" offset="6321716">It is a very low commercial value fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.586" offset="6337703">The evidence, I believe, is in the record which indicates that some of this lower value fish would go down as low as three to five cents of pound for the first price to the fishermen as opposed to salt water in the same value of thirty-five to forty cents of pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.878" offset="6414921">These are very rough figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.512" offset="6421400">I'm giving you the exact market quotations but there is, there isn't can be and it is a substantial difference in the actual economic value of that fish, depending upon the point which it's taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.153" offset="14344025">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.813" offset="14358653">I speak of the interest of Oregon in this litigation because Oregon shares with Washington a community of interest, which is particularly referred to the area of the Columbia River drainage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.756" offset="14422392">The Columbia River runs between Oregon and Washington and by virtue of congressional approval of a compact between the States, Oregon and Washington jointly managed the Columbia River, fishing on the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.564" offset="14493654">Now, the Columbia River is different from the Puyallup River or the rivers in most of western Washington because the Columbia River is the highway by which the fish reach the up river streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.450" offset="14565125">So we have a little different problem in the Columbia River that is indicated in the rivers of western Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.389" offset="14604936">In that river, there have been built a great number of dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.972" offset="14619251">It started in 1941 with the completion of Grand Coulee Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.362" offset="14640776">Grand Coulee Dam wiped out 1100 miles of salmon spawning streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.193" offset="14676093">Since that time there have been five dams built below Coulee, each of which has had its impact on the -- not only on the ability of the fish to spawn, but on the ability of the fish to reach their spawning beds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.971" offset="14747251">And it's for this reason because that -- the States of Oregon and Washington have used their staffs of experts in the fisheries to attempt to determine how many fish must pass up the river in order to preserve the runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.912" offset="14854980">I think it's been spoken up here that in 1911, 50 million pounds of fish were harvested out of the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.385" offset="14900955">That was in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.122" offset="14907852">Since and the last figure we have was for 1967 when 9 million pounds were harvested and 1967 was one of the best years we've had in the Columbia River in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.469" offset="14973262">In -- part of this period, when we've kept records, we've kept the record of the Indian catch because they report it to the selling agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.620" offset="15017880">In 1959, the Indians on the Columbia River caught 39 thousand pounds of salmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.016" offset="15047450">In 1967, when we think there were probably not more than 75 or may be 80 Indians fishing, they caught 1,300,000 pounds of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.606" offset="15113801">The whole purpose of the two agency's activities on the Columbia River has been to enable enough fish to get upstream, to keep an even balance if we could just keep --</text>

            <text syncTime="4477.733" offset="18014333">I wanted to point out to the Court that all of our opponents in the Puyallup's case, this of course does not include Mr. Tanner and his clients, the Nisquallies, here before the Court have suggested that the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior in July of 1967 offer the best solution to the problem of off reservation Indian fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.113" offset="18143796">The States have rejected this offer by the Department of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.239" offset="18172322">This, of course, is not the first time that the three involved States: Washington, Oregon and Idaho have rejected the pro offered federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.279" offset="18220492">Nearly three years ago, in July 1965, the Department of Interior circulated proposed regulations almost identical to those that were promulgated by the Secretary in July of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.958" offset="18287156">These proposed regulations were delivered to the Governors of the three States with the request that the States support the Secretary in the adoption, promulgation and the enforcement of the federal off reservation Indian fishing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.167" offset="18364061">After due consideration, the three States unanimously rejected the proposed federal Indian fishing regulations on the basis that amongst other things that out of the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the power has not delegated to the States by the Constitution and are prohibited to it by the States, prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.729" offset="18482239">That by virtue of this Amendment, it is historically been held by this Court that title to wildlife resources insofar as you're capable of ownership, rests in the States as a trustee thereof for the benefit of all the citizens of the States, Indian and non-Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.505" offset="18553396">And therefore, it's the States took the position that neither the federal government nor the Indians have the power to regulate State resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="5044.988" offset="20283329">And there is a termination statute which specifically provides that the federal government can terminate a reservation or can terminate a Tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="5092.024" offset="20471515">The fish will travel, like I say, 40 to 50 miles up and then they will go to these various branches: the White River, the Stock River, the Clark River, numerous rivers that they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.179" offset="20512057">But one thing I want to submit to the Court is this: that assuming the Court rules that the State does have the right through the exercise of its police power to totally restrict the off reservation fishing or the “in common” fishing, this is not going to resolve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.952" offset="20595231">Because of this, there are in addition to the Puyallup reservation, there are 17 other reservations in the State and as it turned out, the fish, the greatest number of fish always happen to be going into the reservation area, in the area that the Indians have their fishing exclusively and as the State has indicated, “exclusively”.</text>
