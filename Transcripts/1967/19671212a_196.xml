            <label>Mr. Leonard Schroeter</label>
            <text syncTime="30.869" offset="226826">I'm Sorry, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.434" offset="241142">This case arises as a consequence of an order of this Court which postponed further consideration of the question of probable jurisdiction to a hearing of the case in the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.313" offset="288580">Under this Court's orders and its rules counsel should address themselves with the outside -- outset of their brief and oral argument to the question of the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.539" offset="321494">This is in appeal from the final judgment of the three-judge Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2282.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.027" offset="347512">The complaint of the appellant asked the Court to declaratory an injunctive relief when constitutional grounds from the application of 50 U.S.C. 191, which is commonly known as the "Magnuson Act".</text>
            <text syncTime="72.722" offset="394219">It was alleged that the Act was unconstitutional and it was vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.079" offset="411669">And it was contended below that there was unconstitutional delegation to the executive of legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.309" offset="436642">The court below accepted jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.672" offset="446046">Now this was a proper case for the invocation of the three-judge court and thus, for this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.907" offset="467048">The Government concedes in their brief that this Court does have jurisdiction of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.443" offset="489096">And both the Solicitor General and the appellant state that these questions are substantial and that Zemel versus Rusk is authoritative and is positive of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.304" offset="528593">Zemel further makes it clear as thus, the issue that jurisdiction haven't been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.029" offset="555447">This Court will consider the statutory and regulatory schemes as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.578" offset="577703">Now, the Magnuson Act under which this case arises was introduced into Congress in July of 1950, less than one month after the Korean War began.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.997" offset="627336">Now, this was all of us on sure recall, a time of great anxiety of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.375" offset="648861">The Act has cast the House of Representatives with no debate and the Senate with virtually none.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.748" offset="678327">It purported to a man the World War I statute regulating the anchorage and movement of vessels during national emergency by permitting the President to exercise authority other than by the proclamation of National Emergency which he was permitted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.132" offset="747917">And secondly, by extending the authority of the President to: ports, harbors, and waterfront facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.499" offset="777383">The President by executive order shortly thereafter found that "The security of the United States is endangered by reason of subversive activity", and prescribed regulations that delegated his authority to the Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.598" offset="849795">A Commandant of the Coast Guard by such regulations required that as a precondition of maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.108" offset="883754">The maritime workers must be issued a specially validated emergency endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.664" offset="909981">No person shall be issued such a document which is required for an employment nor may he be employed unless "That Commandant is satisfied that the character and habit of life of such person are such to authorize the belief that his employment would not be inimicable to the security of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="224.914" offset="1002977">Now these regulations pursuant to the executive order, where the genesis of what we know as the Maritime Security Screening Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.306" offset="1044564">This program is the only Government to one private employment that blankets an entire industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.746" offset="1074343">It's the only program that covers private employment all together except for the defense contractor security program where the employer, is of course, the contractor of the federal government dealing with classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.625" offset="1125857">Although, originally proposed as an emergency measure by the Attorney General who requested that the authority that was given should expire on a specific date.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.761" offset="1182386">By 1956, well over 800,000 men have been screened under this program and more than 3,700 of them have been denied employment or removed from employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.296" offset="1236511">The program is wholly administered by the Coast Guard with complete, unchecked discretion in a Commandant of the Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.256" offset="1272351">It seeks the lead out subversives form among all maritime workers, who presently number probably in excess of 150,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.604" offset="1309759">And that includes cooks on banana boats, checkers on the docks, sweepers on the Great Lakes, the rivers of -- the navigable rivers of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.888" offset="1366915">It includes people doing every conceivable kind of job in the maritime industry in vessel above 100 ton and of course the dock workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.148" offset="1411950">The way the program works, it seems to me, is well perceived by the experiences of the appellant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.368" offset="1440893">By the information it's already found in the briefs and the joined appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.443" offset="1461164">Mr. Schneider failed, as a young man, during the 1940s and was a qualified -- and qualified as a marine engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.337" offset="1496691">When his children arrived he quit sailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.065" offset="1507662">In 1964 his children being substantially grown, he decided to go back to the sea and he applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.349" offset="1540786">Now applying meant going down to the Coast Guard and filling out certain applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.627" offset="1561893">Among other things, those applications included an original questionnaire which is exhibit A 2 in the joined appendix on page 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.186" offset="1600136">And the original questionnaire asks a number of basic questions like, Have you been arrested for or convicted of the offenses of treasons and sedition, espionage or sabotaging?</text>
            <text syncTime="383.828" offset="1638693">He denied that denied also that he have ever been involved in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.369" offset="1656874">He was then asked whether he have ever been involved in any capacity by a foreign government or by any person on behalf of the foreign government.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.041" offset="1691564">He answered that, "No".</text>
            <text syncTime="398.785" offset="1698461">Last night, while preparing this argument for this Court, I reread this, and to my horror even though this is off of the record but I think it notes something.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.343" offset="1744750">I realized that Mr. Schneider by innocent inadvertence may well have purged himself because for a year, he and his wife and his children lived in a Cabot in Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.080" offset="1795741">Now for the wise of me, I don't know whether the answer to this question if one works for a Cabot's in Israel and lives in a Cabot, it's really yes or no.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.066" offset="1831685">Question?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_schroeter" startTime="432.709" stopTime="763.067">
            <label>Mr. Leonard Schroeter</label>
            <text syncTime="432.709" offset="1834193">That's question number 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.429" offset="1841089">Mr. Schneider has no idea I'm making these concessions on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.170" offset="1856031">But I think it's significant that the character and quality of these questions are such a character that such an inadvertent on Mr. Schneider's part such a lack of knowledge put indeed have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.349" offset="1904724">He was then asked whether he advocated or had ever advocated the overthrow or alteration of the Government of the United States by for surveillance or by unconstitutional means which he denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.650" offset="1945997">He then had submitted to him what is commonly known as the Attorney General's list and which is listed in detail in this particular -- in the joined appendix commencing on page 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.694" offset="2002108">And he was asked whether he had ever submitted material for publication which -- in which he gave a negative response.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.637" offset="2025932">And whether he had ever been a member of or affiliated with any way any of these organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.364" offset="2052786">Now as the record subsequent -- as it subsequently appears in the record in his counsel subsequently pointed out by way, Mr. Schneider had or idealistic reason that a casual member of the Communist Party during his youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.431" offset="2109106">He had drifted away from the Communist Party in the late 1940s.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.124" offset="2123839">He had also and these were problems that he faced when he have been assessed that he'd reading this list.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.922" offset="2151111">He had also for example had certain contacts because he was interested in politics with some problems in the defense of a well known west coast labor leader, in which he left unmentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.486" offset="2193324">He had gone to a labor school as an active member of a trade union.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.534" offset="2213491">He had been involved in democratic politics in the State of Washington which during given periods of involved some relationships with some of the organizations listed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.585" offset="2261661">He found it extraordinarily difficult to answer these questions about conduct that is 20 to 25 years older.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.546" offset="2301576">He found the questions vague and uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.932" offset="2311084">He did not know what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.723" offset="2318294">And as a consequence, he answered the questions in the fashion set forth on page 33 that he had been a member of many political and social organizations including several names in the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.695" offset="2354134">He couldn't remember the names of most of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.357" offset="2360822">He couldn't specific about any but in no event have he been a member of anything for some substantial period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.279" offset="2392482">This answer of course was given under pain and penalty of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.250" offset="2412335">And it's also noted on page 33 of the joined appendix, it appears that the intelligence division of the Coast Guard received this questionnaire, just a few weeks after it was answered, and proceeded to check it by using the facilities of the FBI and the other Government investigated bodies that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.451" offset="2497181">There were no answers, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.757" offset="2510451">Mr. Schneider went to the Coast Guard and said, "What's going on?"</text>
            <text syncTime="605.303" offset="2524557">"Why am I not receiving my special validation?"</text>
            <text syncTime="607.861" offset="2534797">They wrote several letters to which there was no response.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.795" offset="2546604">In mid March he retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.224" offset="2560293">And the counsel then by virtual of a number of letters which again are set fort commencing on page 17, approached the Coast Guard by mail and said -- asked what was happening and why Mr. Schneider did not receive the special validation.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.864" offset="2618807">The Coast Guard responded saying that he's reluctant to furnish names and dates of membership had delayed their investigation now some five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.472" offset="2665305">And however, they anticipated that action will be taken in the near future which presume to me that he would receive his special validation.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.363" offset="2704802">Nonetheless, the special validation was not received.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.731" offset="2718281">And on March 25th, Mr. Schneider received instead a group of interrogatories from the Government when she was also compelled to answer under pain and penalty of perjury are those interrogatory being contained on page 35 of the joined appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.211" offset="2792260">He is of course involved asks questions to such as listing the name of the political and social organizations to which he belong, the location, the dates of his membership, his reasons for discontinuing his membership, his present attitude 20 years later for the principles and objectives of such an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.106" offset="2863835">He was asked whether he was now or had ever been a member or affiliated in any way with the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="695.358" offset="2884838">Whether you'd ever subscribed to a newspaper the people's world?</text>
            <text syncTime="698.505" offset="2897377">Whether he had ever engaged in any activities on behalf of that newspaper?</text>
            <text syncTime="702.377" offset="2912841">And then he was asked to write an essay on his present attitude towards the Communist Party, and the rights to further a philosophical essay, and his present attitude towards the principles and objectives of communism, and towards the form of the government in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.878" offset="2966862">These sort of do it yourself worthy I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.808" offset="2978565">In any event, all of these were under pain and penalty of perjury, to answer these questions searching his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.203" offset="3016182">Well at this point, Mr. Schneider obviously had a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.928" offset="3031124">It was a dilemma of his or it was a dilemma of concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.110" offset="3043767">Mr. Schneider wanted to shift but he valued his constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.205" offset="3060172">Counsel didn't wish to subject if the hazards of self-incrimination or for perjury indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.844" offset="3082742">So Mr. Schneider faced the consequence of answering the questions thus, subjecting himself to the hazards of such an indictment or if you chose not to answer the questions the hazard of never been able to proceed in its chosen occupation.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.915" offset="3523062">Now all of this is in face of the fact that the Government neither contested nor produced evidence to contradict the fact that Mr. Schneider has always been and is loyal to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.697" offset="3618147">It appears to me that the only thing one can safely produced from this failure to grant him special certification was a punitive effort on the part of the Coast Guard, to deprive him of his livelihood because it is an assertion of his constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.382" offset="3696933">Now the issue post here, the central issue post is that expressed by this court in by question, whether the right to employment can be conditioned upon the surrender of the constitutional rights which could not be a bridge by directing Government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.165" offset="3751999">The Court of course, this Court sites many cases and answers the question negatively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.338" offset="5144743">But the horror of the situation of course, this shouldn't be put through in the first instance and the problem of counsel is that Mr. Schneider wanted to go to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.491" offset="5185285">And at the same time, he wanted to protect rights that he got with pressures and that his principle of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.717" offset="5222275">And really the basic principles opposed by this case it seems to me, a very fundamental kind of principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.499" offset="5257383">First of all, it seems to me that we have post in this case the whole concept of the privacy of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.743" offset="5290297">This would be claim of Government necessity which is really what the Bill of Rights I taken it all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.400" offset="5316942">And an implicit in this, there are notions of the non-acceptance of assumptions or presumptions or inferences of guilt based upon people's beliefs and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.937" offset="5355081">We were in this in the long terms of concepts and presumption of innocence and burdens of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.175" offset="5380054">And the recognition that I hope and believe that Courts have that people had the capacity for a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.156" offset="5407953">Implicit in this is the non-assumption that individuals are tainted by the allegedly bad character of their associational relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.815" offset="5442644">The assertion it seems to me of vital -- of the vital public necessity, not just Schneider's necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.421" offset="5469080">But the public's necessity that individuals be non-intimidated in areas of beliefs, thoughts, speech, and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.267" offset="5496456">Really, so the democratic political process can work, the assertion of the essential of the human personality, the right of privacy in a sense which includes the right to remain silent laws to speak, the right to be free of the indignity of inquisitorial kinds of inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.855" offset="5570748">Also it seems implicit in this case, is the necessity and the maintenance for freedom of a rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.223" offset="5600214">Now, what the Solicitor General of the United States in his form of capacity of Dean of my law school, had to say in a very good book called the Fifth Amendment, where he referred to the Second Chapter, "To the Law of the Land" this whole concept of due process that underlies these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.053" offset="5667610">The notion that we cannot maintain our democracy , if we're outside the laws the justice of this Court in his former capacity of the distinguished constitutional lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.837" offset="5706689">I pointed out an Article by that name in the Atlantic monthly in August 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.127" offset="5727901">An article which could be read profitably today because it describes Mr. Justice Fortas' Article outside the law describes the very rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.097" offset="5763741">That is inherent in the maritime screen program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.813" offset="5778578">So at the minimum it seems to me that we have the right to expect from our Government, my Government, your Government that it will take no steps to compel a man to place himself in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.706" offset="5830196">That no one may be subjected to the possibility of the punishment by laws of employment unless probable cause is first found for an assertion of disloyalty or lack of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.788" offset="5874500">So that he should be confronted in detail and with specificity as to any charges against him.</text>
