            <label>Mr. Benjamin E. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="55.321" offset="324629">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.130" offset="339884">The District Court below in this matter was directed by this Court per curiam in 1966 to reconsider this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.839" offset="414699">This is a -- an injunction case brought in the Southern District of Mississippi heard before a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.331" offset="452733">The three-judge court decided that the injunction should not issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.276" offset="468511">They appealed that to this Court and this Court noted probable jurisdiction and sent the matter back to the three-judge District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi with instructions that the per curiam -- with instructions that the issuance of the injunction requested to halt state prosecutions of civil rights workers should be considered in one; whether or not Title 28 Section 2283 the writ prohibition, the injunction prohibition statute apply and secondly; whether or not the injunction should issue by virtue of the meeting of the criteria set forth by this Court in the Dombrowski case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.353" offset="632769">This Court therefore is familiar with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.838" offset="642696">This is the second time it's been here.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.292" offset="652518">Briefly, the injunction was filed in April 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.068" offset="667669">First judge hearing -- the three-judge hearing was in July of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.125" offset="683865">This Court's first opinion was in July of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.209" offset="700165">We retried the case in October and it was decided -- October 1965 and it was decided by the three-judge court in December 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.654" offset="734020">There are approximately 51 or 55 state criminal proceedings pending and it's based upon a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.270" offset="756485">They are based upon a statute which forbids blocking the ingress and egress, unreasonably blocking the ingress and egress to courthouses in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.944" offset="807163">I will discuss the 2283 problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.968" offset="819284">My colleague, Mr. Kinoy will discuss the case as the facts relate to the Dombrowski case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.529" offset="841540">Basically, we take the position that 2283 of Title 28 is not a jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.711" offset="874245">It is a comity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.878" offset="882918">It cannot prevent the issuance of the injunction or the consideration of the injunction sought in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.951" offset="915205">Judge Rives, Circuit Judge Rives below who was one of the members of the three-judge court agreed with us in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.931" offset="947075">He said simply very quickly on, “I would hold” and this is on page 60 of the transcript, “I would hold that under the circumstances of this case, if the allegations are approved, Section 1983 which is the basis for the injunction suits sought below, Section 1983 is an express exception to Section 2283.”</text>
            <text syncTime="235.532" offset="1045504">And he says again, “The principles rationally extrapolated from the cases creating express exceptions to the prohibition of Section 2283 derive content from the concrete situations which gave rise to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.097" offset="1115721">Where a specific, limited and clearly delineated substantive right has been conferred by Congress, the courts have found an express exception to Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.461" offset="1157204">The express exception is the necessary co-commitment of the need to vindicate federally created rights and is entirely consistent with the history of Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.339" offset="1196701">That appears on section -- on page 63 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.463" offset="1213210">Now, we take the position Your Honors that this is a comity statute, that is Section 2283 is a comity statute, that it has to be understood and explained and utilized in a comity situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.213" offset="1276217">What was meant when Section 1983 was drawn up by the reconstruction Congress, it meant that these federally -- given federally determined rights were going to be used to protect the newly freed slaves, that they were going to be used to vindicate federal rights and Federal Courts in the southern states.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.772" offset="1374438">And that Section 1983 was going to see to it that the Fourteenth Amendment was fully implemented, fully carried out and it gave equitable relief under 1983 to the individual suitor, to individuals who could come in and ask for an injunction, and that's what the individual suitor is doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.960" offset="1447163">These people in Mississippi were involved in a voter registration drive and you can see from the pictures in the record, they were walking around the courthouse with signs that said, “Mississippians are Americans, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.873" offset="1494915">We want the right to vote,” entirely, completely, utterly peaceful demonstration.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin E. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="359.681" offset="1542144">The voting act as well as the one of 1964, too, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.426" offset="1565027">But what we're saying is that these were federal rights that they were trying to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.042" offset="1587493">They were really talking in terms of Section 1971 and then later Section 1973(b)(i) or (i)(b) of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.954" offset="1635140">And they were trying I think -- of course, it's pretty obvious what they were trying to do, they're trying to get people to register vote, but there is just as much reason for saying that Section 1971 gives these people an expressly authorized congressional authority to come in and ask for this injunction as it is to say Section 2038 of the Voting Rights Act has the same thing attached to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.742" offset="1742346">And we also know that -- for example, when this Court decided the Rachel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.207" offset="1768155">They decided it's of Title 2 of the Public Accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.865" offset="1782784">They gave an actual thrust, in other words, the positive requirement that there have been injunction sought or there be relief sought, this authorized removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.484" offset="1825311">Well, here this Court by turning down certiorari in the Hamer versus Campell case where there was an injunction sought and overturning of election, here was a private citizen coming in under 1983 and other related statutes, attempting to exert a right and here, you didn't hold that 2283 was a ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.593" offset="1913710">2283 cannot be a ban in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.558" offset="1925622">If 2283 comes into play, it cannot come into play in this situation simply because if the criteria set forth in Dombrowski are met, well then this isn't expressly an authorized exception to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.490" offset="2017364">The whole thrust of the case for example in Potter versus Dixon, in Rachel and in US versus Woods and all those cases we're citing in the brief, the Court has every time made an exception and said this is an expressly authorized exception to 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.023" offset="2087476">You can come in and file these injunction proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.014" offset="2107434">I think it's very clear that that's exactly what they were talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.084" offset="2127705">The other -- my opponent, Mr. Wells in his brief talks about the Baines case being a bar and that's Baines versus City of Danville, but when that case was decided, this Court had not come down with a Dombrowski hearing yet and was pretty clear that the same judge who wrote the Baines opinion, later on came out and talked in terms of Dombrowski which was now then available to him in the case of Unites Steel Workers of America versus Bagwell which is 383 Federal Reporter 2nd the September 1967 case in which he says on page 495 the abstention doctrine warrants refusal to exercise properly invoked federal jurisdiction to adjudicate the constitutionality of the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.363" offset="2316831">If there is any doubt about the statute's applicability to the challenger or to his conduct and when construction of the statute by the state courts may remove the constitutional issue from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.891" offset="2358941">When however the statute is obviously applicable to the plaintiff in the course of conduct that when the statute is not susceptible to a construction that will otherwise avoid the necessity of deciding the constitutional question, a Federal Court may not properly state its hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.239" offset="2420276">So really what we're saying here is that we're not so much in exception, expressly authorized by the Congress but where you have the federally given rights as you do in Section 1983 of Title 42, you have a positive federal burden and duty to step in and issue the injunction to protect the issuance of -- to protect those rights so that 1983 is not a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.571" offset="2537618">It is a positive statement under the theory of comity that there has to be a right on the part of either the federal government or the individual litigant to go forward and issue the injunction or to hold the hearing and see if the injunction should issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.661" offset="2622046">This was made all the more clear when this Court decided the Peacock case because when Mr. Justice Stewart wrote the decision in Peacock in a portion of the opinion as this Court well knows, denying the right of removal in that case, he said in effect and I don't need to quote it, that there should be -- there will be other remedies available and one of these other remedies alluded to by Mr. Justice Stewart in that Peacock opinion was the remedy of injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.464" offset="2749210">Now, this is the remedy we're seeking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.553" offset="2757569">I say to you gentlemen here now, we've lost the removal in Peacock.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.764" offset="2778467">We can no longer -- the situation in the south is still bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.317" offset="2792678">There is no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.326" offset="2800724">In voting situations, there is still violence going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.802" offset="2818591">There are shootings going on, and we know that there were some last night in front of (Inaudible) house down there in Mississippi a shotgun went off.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.187" offset="2852133">We still have a voting problem down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.077" offset="2863731">I don't care how many acts you're going to pass, you're still are going to have this problem and we still need some protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.478" offset="2889331">We didn't get it in Peacock but we're back now down to the bottom of the barrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.104" offset="2911796">If we don't get it with the injunction procedure, we're going to be in serious trouble down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.231" offset="2940322">What you're saying -- alright, I can understand how you would feel about removal when a lawyer can come in and simply file a removal petition and he ties up the docket of the Federal Court, the Court has to hold a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.770" offset="2990477">And I think Mr. Justice White was talking about that when we argued Peacock about the problems involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.638" offset="3009912">But here, you have a more precise remedy available to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.917" offset="3023078">You have an injunction proceeding which is a more delicate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.261" offset="3040423">It's one that will only tie up the federal courts and their dockets if the judge, after hearing or looking at the case feels that he's got something that ought to be looked into.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.109" offset="3079816">Does it meet the Dombrowski criteria?</text>
            <text syncTime="748.114" offset="3095803">The whole situation would be -- I think would resolve itself differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.000" offset="5327391">Thank you, Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.736" offset="5342333">With the time I have left, I'll start the argument, with the permission of the Court, I would like to turn to what we regard as the basic issue in this case or as Judge Rives has put it in his opinion, the only real issue in this case and that is whether the facts as proved require the granting of the injunctive relief requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.390" offset="5436897">Or as this Court put it in the second question in the remand to the District Court whether the injunctive relief is appropriate in light of the criteria set forth in Dombrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.307" offset="5484648">For as Mr. Smith has argued here and as Judge Rives put so succinctly in his opinion, the essence of the 2283 problem is that the principles of comity which are codified in 2283 embody the concept of the primacy of the federal courts in protecting fundamental federal rights expressed in the 1871 Act, now of course 1983 which this Court developed soulfully in this (Inaudible) decision in this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.596" offset="5657788">If those criteria are met, then the fundamental principles which govern the federal system require not sanction but require the granting of the injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.844" offset="5726751">Now, the approach to this fundamental question I would suggest to the Court is governed by two main considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.266" offset="5772413">This case for the first time comes to this Court bottomed fully upon an evidentiary record and an evidentiary record fully tried which the appellees -- which Mississippi now concedes that with two relatively minor exceptions, our statement of facts in the brief are generally correct and I call the Court's attention to the appellee's brief in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.559" offset="5933641">Now, we suggest this is a rather unusual concession by appellees because the statement of facts which emerged from the evidentiary hearing presents the issue to this Court in the following matrix of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.227" offset="6012322">The following fundamental conclusions of fact upon which the Dombrowski criteria flowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.086" offset="6043669">First; the demonstrations which continued over a period of four months or for the purpose of protesting discrimination against Negro citizens in voting and encouraging Negro citizens to register to vote were at all times entirely peaceful, conceded by Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.354" offset="6140740">Secondly, that the demonstrators at all times remained within the express area designated originally by the law enforcement officers who had themselves selected that area so that the demonstrators, when marching, would not obstruct access to the courthouse, conceded by Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.573" offset="6265710">Third; that this statute has been selectively enforced so as to arrest only persons engaged in these activities, conceded by Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.011" offset="6339375">Now, I suggest to the Court that the first decisive fact which emerges from the evidentiary hearing upon which this Court must judge the criteria of Dombrowski is that the statute has admittedly and open, been selectively enforced in the area of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.259" offset="6456404">Now, the facts of selective enforcement uncontested and testified to by Mississippi state authorities at the hearing is exactly parallel to the situation this Court faced in Cox against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.544" offset="6537592">The testimony of the country prosecuting attorney, Mr. Dukes, which is set forth in page 74 of our brief for the Court's convenience was that parades which block the streets and obstruct traffic are permitted in Hattiesburg and have been permitted by arrangements with the city officials and that there are no standards in the statute or anywhere else for determination by the officials as to which demonstration to permit, that there are no permit procedures and no standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.861" offset="6726823">Now, as this Court said in Cox both in the majority and in the concurring opinions, this situation is the clear equivalent of a statute which permits officials to act as a censor and that the pervasive restraint upon freedom of expression, or as this Court put it in Dombrowski, the chilling effect upon the expression of First Amendment rights is not any less effective than a statute which expressly permits such selective enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.157" offset="6904038">Now, what I suggest to the Court is so shocking here on this hearing, is that the testimony admittedly adduced by the Mississippi officials vividly illustrates the constitutional evil in selective enforcement which this Court has condemned from Edwards to Cox and which every member of this Court has adhered to whether in its dissenting opinions or majority opinions, that this constitutional evil is embraced by the appellees and the majority below as the very justification for this selective enforcement.</text>
