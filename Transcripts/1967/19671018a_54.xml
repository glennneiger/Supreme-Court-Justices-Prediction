            <text syncTime="14.005" offset="159431">Gentlemen, before Mr. Gooch and Mr. Douglas, I'd just like to say that this is another case where counsel is representing an indigent defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.234" offset="220348">And I want to tell you what a comfort it is to the Court to know that lawyers and various communities are willing to give their services to a cause of this kind because every man, rich or poor should have a defense through counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.349" offset="288789">So, I appreciate very much and in behalf of the Court, I express it to you, Mr. Gooch, for having accepted this responsibility.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="69.673" offset="382098">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.329" offset="400697">This case involving the condemnation of respondent's land is here on writ of certiorari for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.657" offset="438000">It raises an aspect of the recurring problem of the relationship of the property rights of riparian landowners to the power of the Federal Government over navigation and navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.312" offset="496619">In particular, the question presented here is whether when the United States condemns riparian land for use in a river improvement project it must pay the owner not only for the land's value as upland, but also for such incremental value as the land may have as a site for a port.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.177" offset="600064">Respondents owned two tracks of undeveloped land containing a total of approximately 260 acres lying along the Oregon Shore of the Columbia River some 250 miles up from the Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.628" offset="669863">It was taken in connection with the John Day Lock and Dam; a project authorized by Congress in 1950 as part of a comprehensive program for the development of the Columbia River and distributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.561" offset="729631">The John Day Dam is a multipurpose project designed for flood control, hydroelectric power, and navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.376" offset="760874">And I think that there can be no doubt here that the project serves a bona fide navigational purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.673" offset="790026">When completed, the dam will create a lake of some 75 miles which will fill an important missing link between the lakes created downstream and upstream by prior dam projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.055" offset="855542">It does complete a slack water navigational passage running hundreds of miles from the Pacific Coast into the interiors, all the way to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.367" offset="904861">It was estimated in 1950 that the gain to the economy from the dam's navigational function alone exceeded in $1,948 dollars, a million and three quarter -- one and three quarter million dollars per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.271" offset="972466">The creation of the lake which will be approximately 100 feet deep at the dam site inevitably involves a degree of flooding of uplands because respondent's tracks are within the area to be flooded.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.790" offset="1030562">The United States commence this condemnation proceeding in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.348" offset="1056789">The sole question litigated below was the amount that the United States must pay for the property taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.704" offset="1086151">Although respondents sought to raise other issues both courts below held that they had not done so in a timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.752" offset="1118333">And that aspect of the case has not been brought before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.252" offset="1136410">We do not have here therefore any challenge to the validity of the taking as it proper exercise of the Government's powers of eminent domain, nor any question as to the use that may subsequently be made of the land taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.542" offset="1193566">With respect to the issue of compensation, respondents indicated before trial, they would seek to prove that most of the land was useful for agriculture and for the extraction of gravel and sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.620" offset="1245811">But that a small portion of the land had a higher value because of its utility as a port site.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.900" offset="1274964">The reasons which I will return to in a moment, the District Court excluded all evidence of port site value.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.299" offset="1304534">A jury awarded some $7,000 for one fact on the basis of agricultural and mineral uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.794" offset="1334523">And the party stipulated that $2,400 was appropriate compensation for the other track.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.889" offset="1394918">And there is an affidavit of a sea captain, river captain who says I think that a -- not less than $50,000 would be appropriate for the port site.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.806" offset="1830640">But there was a negotiation between the State of Oregon and respondents and an agreement between them which was -- for an option to purchase this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.506" offset="1881422">At which time, the State of Oregon I believe, agreed to an option price for purchase of $400 per acre for the port site part of the land.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.487" offset="1993331">The District Court's decision that the respondents are not entitled to compensation for the land's utility as a port site was based on the premise that such utility was entirely dependent of the land's location on and access to a navigable river.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.496" offset="2073370">And that such use was therefore subject to the historic servitude or power of the Federal Government over the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.481" offset="2113285">In this respect, the District Court believed correctly we submit that it was bound by this Court's decisions in United States v. Twin City and United States v. Virginia Electric Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.260" offset="2168456">Those cases both held that when the United States takes land -- riparian to a navigable stream, it need not pay compensation for so Much of the value of that land as may be attributable to power site value.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.916" offset="2235016">The District Court found that it could not distinguish between power site value and port site value.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.984" offset="2267303">It pointed out that both involved the exploitation of the navigable stream and both can't be operated without the navigable stream.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.386" offset="4140910">Now we submit that a port site in the sense that respondents use it in the sense that it's just not the water is nothing more or less than a stepping stone into the water, the inter-navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.044" offset="4203499">Its value is precisely the value of access to and the use of an artery of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.377" offset="4232861">That right of access and use as we recognize among the bundle of rights that have been traditionally protected under state law as riparian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.068" offset="4275597">But like all other riparian rights access and use is a qualified right, qualified traditionally by the compatible interest of other riparian owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.366" offset="4328887">And it is also clear that on a navigable stream, riparian rights are subject to the paramount qualification that has been termed the Federal Government's navigational servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.489" offset="4377370">That is to say that the exercise of its powers under the Commerce Clause, Congress may authorize projects which will impair or utterly destroy riparian rights as recognized by the state law on navigable waters without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.347" offset="4444766">That proposition is established by decisions of this Court going back more than a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.761" offset="4462425">And I don't think it is seriously open to dispute today where that respondent's dispute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.108" offset="4487816">It is based, we believe, on the very wise perception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.488" offset="4505370">But the great navigable waterways of a nation, waterways down which flow the commerce of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.411" offset="4541001">Waterways which were of critical importance to opening up the continent and waterways on which we just currently spend something like a billion dollars a year to perfect and improve that those waterways are national assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.140" offset="4603904">As the Court said in Gilman v. Philadelphia and 3 Wall, for purposes of commerce, the navigable waters are the public property of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.990" offset="4647372">Under these circumstances to require the United States to pay for riparian rights destroyed through river harbor improvements would be to create private planes in the public domain as this Court said in Twin City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.580" offset="4717693">In some, vis-à-vis the United States, riparian owners enjoy no private right to exploit navigable waters for which they must be compensated under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.961" offset="4771192">Now to be sure in the present case, there's a taking of fast land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.588" offset="4789687">That is land above the high water mark of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.881" offset="4806928">For the val -- land's value as upland, we concededly must pay just compensation but we deny that the United States must pay for the privilege previously enjoyed, the special advantage previously enjoyed by respondents abusing a public waterway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.602" offset="4901804">I think there is an analogy here to the decision of this Court in United States v. Powelson, where the Court rejected the contention that the landowner's privilege to use the power of eminent domain under a state grand enhance the value of the condemned property because it created a possibility of uniting it with other tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.611" offset="4989785">The Court said that the landowner's privileged there was not private property as contemplated by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.632" offset="5017893">And that an award based on that privilege, on that advantage, would be an appropriation of public authority to a holy private end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.659" offset="5058017">Precisely here, we think that the advantage of using that water, water which is -- belongs to the public is not the sort of economic interest for which the public has to pay when it wants to improve that waterway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.946" offset="5127189">Now even more in point of course, other courts relatively recent positions in Twin City and Virginia Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.464" offset="5153207">In both cases, the Court held that the landowners were not entitled to compensation with the power site value of their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.158" offset="5184031">Mr. Justice Stewart wrote for the Court in Virginia Electric, “Just as the navigational privilege permits the Government to reduce the value of riparian lands by denying the riparian owner access to the stream without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.394" offset="5244949">It also permits the Government to disregard the value arising from the same fact of riparian location in compensating the owner when fast lands are taken”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.936" offset="5295104">That I believe is precisely our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.790" offset="5310568">Now to distinguish the power site cases, respondents urge the Congress has established a much more rigorous system of regulation of power sites under the Federal Power Act than -- over port sites under the Rivers and Harbors Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.359" offset="5376815">But the type of regulation that has been found desirable on either subject can tell us nothing about what is permissible under the Commerce Clause or required under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.500" offset="5437419">The fact that Congress has found a more relaxed mode of regulation but not a missing mode of regulation appropriate for ports and harbors, doesn't tell you that that exhaust their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.469" offset="5489246">And it certainly doesn't tell you the full scope of the Government's navigational servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.327" offset="5528639">There's also a suggestion which may have been shared by the court below that because this Court has always spoken of the flow of the stream as that in which there is no private interest, it referred only to moving water and ports don't require moving water although power sites do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.383" offset="5620903">But I think that that must be fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.836" offset="5630725">I just can't see -- no one has been able to explain how any constitutional doctrine can depend on the rapidity with which the water moves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.453" offset="5677223">There has never been a suggestion by this Court that the Federal Government's interest is limited to the motion of the water as opposed to the water itself in whatever state it may be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2256.404" offset="9128939">Now, in this connection that is with respect to wharves and docks and the Chandler-Dunbar cases, this Court said, these two parcels seemed to have been connected by a costly fill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.667" offset="9174079">They front it upon deep water above the head of the rapids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.077" offset="9187662">They have therefore a special value for wharves and docks and so forth, and have been so used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2279.752" offset="9222353">(A) For general wharfage, dock and warehouse purposes disconnecting with the development of power in the rapids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.674" offset="9258088">Subsequently, this Court have self-noted in Twin City that Chandler-Dunbar gave compensation for canals and locks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.997" offset="9291316">The Court stated in part in a Footnote, it may be that the Court was influenced by the fact that on a special fact of the case, the use of the land for canals and locks was only consistent for the dominant navigational servitude of the United States and indeed they aided navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.048" offset="9359548">The Court could just as easily have used the term wharves and docks as these two usually were held compensable in Chandler versus Dunbar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.984" offset="9395284">And of course, Chandler-Dunbar was expressly stated in the Twin City case as the case which controls Twin City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.168" offset="9420048">It's never been overruled, nor until this case arose, has the correctness for the payment of compensation for wharves and docks ever been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.841" offset="9458709">This is the first time the question has ever risen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.394" offset="9480965">As a collateral matter, as I pointed out earlier, we think that River Rouge is also directly applicable because this is the case that arose under 33 U.S.C. (a) -- 595, which provides that in ascertaining the value of properties, you shall not take into consideration any increment of value by reason of the Government's improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.007" offset="9575424">In that particular case, they -- there were some confusion over what are riparian rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.859" offset="9598830">What do they mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.621" offset="9601860">Are they rights of substantial value?</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.132" offset="9611891">This Court held that the instructions of the trial court to the jury on this question did not sufficiently emphasize the historical value of riparian rights and therefore that the jury undoubtedly did not deduct enough from the award relative to the increment in value by reason of the improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.474" offset="9697259">Now it seems impossible to us to acquaint the result in River Rouge with the contention now being made by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.564" offset="9721605">If any increment in value due to the waterway improvement must be deducted, how can it logically be argued that it's fair and proper to disregard the initial value which existed long prior to the development?</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.073" offset="9787643">In fact, it's rather interesting that the lower court's instruction in the River Rouge Case is essentially what the Government is contending today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.390" offset="9828916">When River Rouge was being argued before this Court, I would -- the Government took just the opposite position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.380" offset="9852844">Now it's true as the counsel pointed out that we contend that there's no dependency here on the floor of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.998" offset="9883355">Mr. Justice White, you pointed out correctly so sir that the presence of water is absolutely necessary, or else you don't have a port site.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.042" offset="9915538">However, hydroelectric site that is a wholly dependent upon the flow of the stream, in this case no such dependency exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.869" offset="9962872">As results have pointed out in Twin City was respect to the Court's reasoning in Chandler-Dunbar, the use of respondent's port site lands is wholly consistent with the dominant navigational servitude of the Government and in fact would actually aid navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.760" offset="10018461">A hydroelectric power site to be of value requires the dam across the entire reach of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.142" offset="10039986">And thus, in a sense, is inimical to navigation unless locks are installed in the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.402" offset="10068929">Port site value exist however particularly in this case whether or not a dam has ever constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.791" offset="10098500">Hydroelectric power site value is relatively new in concept, it having come into existence chiefly in the last 50 to 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.894" offset="10134967">On the other hand, port site values date back to the inception of English jurisprudence and have always been recognized as valuable riparian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.316" offset="10176658">We further contend the Congress has in the Submerged Lands Act indicated a national policy to protect and preserve the property rights of the states and their grantees in submerged imminent waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.070" offset="10227649">It will indeed be anomalous to preserve such rights in submerged lands and deny those same rights with respect to upland properties.Our stating at another fashion, the Submerged Lands Act makes it perfectly clear that ownership of riparian lands is vested in the states and their grantees, control of the navigation remains in the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.179" offset="11068061">Oh, I have this answer, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.427" offset="11073076">I think we're again confusing perhaps control versus for proprietorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.194" offset="11092198">No one disputes the right of the Federal Government to build a dike in front of our property and cut off access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.250" offset="11112364">They could do it under the navigational servitude and we have no complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.241" offset="11132322">They could dredge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.690" offset="11138173">And pile all of their spoils directly in front of the property and render it absolutely valueless as a port site.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.745" offset="11162311">Again, we're talking about control over navigation -- in the navigational servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.766" offset="11182477">But when they come to taking actual fee ownership of the property, this is a different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.196" offset="11212152">They are then taking from the owner some compensable property interest which either before had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.377" offset="11240887">This I think is the basic distinction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.606" offset="11249768">The Government elected itself to proceed on the principles of eminent domain and not by way of control where the streams flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.307" offset="11288639">This was of course one of the things that was involved in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.864" offset="11306820">The Court will recall that the primary controversy over the Submerged Lands Act was the impact of the famous decisions of this Court with respect to ownership with the titled lands and the oil lands just offshore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.265" offset="11360423">However, contained in the Submerged Lands Act was also another clause and another provision which in order as Senator Holland said to make assurance doubly sure, they wish to confirm title, actual proprietorship, confirm title to all riparian owners and to the states primarily into their grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.829" offset="11462719">But they made one express exclusion in this little Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.150" offset="11475989">They excluded waterpower or the use of water for the protection of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.540" offset="11497514">They granted all other proprietary rights to the states and to their grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.049" offset="11519561">And as Senator Holland pointed out and I quote, and he said this is his direct statements on the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.276" offset="11548505">“Taking the nation as a whole there are undoubtedly several billion dollars worth of port facilities alone located on inland waters are on built uplands which were once inland waters".</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.338" offset="11588733">So it's easy to understand why the attorneys general, municipal officers, port authorities, and other similar officials, are deeply concerned in this fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.541" offset="11625514">And they're insistent that the Congress show effectually -- released to the state and to their grantees all property rights in the inland waters and their beds saving only to the Federal Government those rights which will enable it to perform its constitutional functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.246" offset="11688312">Senator Holland also continued, he was the principal proponent of the Senate Joint Resolution 13 which later became known as the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.203" offset="11724152">That such developed lands belonging to private grantees greatly exceeded the value of public developments because there are only tens of thousands of such developments in the inland waters of our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.721" offset="11774307">A review of the entire congressional record in the debates on the Submerged Lands Act indicates it practically, every decision of this Court for the last hundred years resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.965" offset="11811192">It's quite clear that the rationale of the Chandler-Dunbar Case was clearly understood and for that reason a specific exclusion of waterpower, and the usual water for the production of power was put into the Act and no proprietary rights therein were granted to the states where their successors where it signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.534" offset="11885484">But I think that clearly the converse appears except for water power and the usual water to produce the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.817" offset="11910666">The Federal Government in the Submerged Lands Act expressly disclaimed any interest in and in effect quitclaimed all of the proprietary rights in a pertinent to submerge lands lying under navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.467" offset="11965210">Now interestingly enough the Submerged Lands Act was not cited in either Twin City or Virginia Power Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.599" offset="11989765">But I think this submission is not at all surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.567" offset="12001677">In the first place, the issue in both cases involved only waterpower of the use of water to produce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.395" offset="12028949">There were no other fast land value such as we find in Chandler-Dunbar, those were not involved in Twin City and Virginia Power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.748" offset="12230405">After deciding several decisions relating to the state proprietorship of submerged lands, the following language appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.179" offset="12304071">The states submit that the Federal Government has paramount powers over navigable waters to improve and keep them open for public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.734" offset="12330297">And that the Government has paramount constitutional powers of government over these lands for national defense, commerce and international affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.890" offset="12362898">They asked merely that governmental powers be maintained separate and distinct from proprietorship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.908" offset="12450983">The debates in the Senate alone on the Submerged Lands Act occupy some 3,000 pages in the congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.314" offset="12484629">The measure being discussed while technically labeled, Senate Joint Resolution 13 was merely the successor to a host of prior measures to which were passed and then vetoed by the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="3117.539" offset="12573550">But the intent of Congress in passing the Submerged Lands Act to protect all property rights in hearing in waterfront ownership, on inland and coastal waters with the sole exception of waterpower or the usual water for the production of power shows through with complete clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.444" offset="12685145">The importance of the decision in this Court on a national level cannot be overemphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.421" offset="12709073">Billions of dollars have been spent in this country to acquire waterfront sites not for the production of power but to enable its owners to have access to navigable water for commercial and recreational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.201" offset="12756198">The economic impact upon waterfront owners throughout the nation with the government's position is sustained in this case would be catastrophic and would throw in serious doubt the ownership and the use of the riparian lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3668.450" offset="14777135">It's perfectly clear that the states owned that title and -- or that they are grantees on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.937" offset="14807124">But that has always been thought consistent with the servitude of the United States for purposes of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.901" offset="14838993">Finally, let me turn briefly to the Chandler-Dunbar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.868" offset="14854875">Undoubtedly that is one of the cases on which the two power site cases depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.227" offset="14880266">It is true that in that case, a grant -- a compensation was allowed for a piece of land that had utility as the potential site for a canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.964" offset="14935228">I think three things can be said about that aspect of Chandler-Dunbar because after all the principal thrust of that case is that the United States doesn't have to pay for power site value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.448" offset="14997191">The three things are all said in Twin City in a Footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.872" offset="15010879">They are -- perhaps the Court there thought that that was consistent with the navigable uses of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.043" offset="15043584">Perhaps the case ought to be limited to its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.082" offset="15059675">And in any event, these were uses of the water -- only the indirect sense that they provided a place where you could take boats away from the river, and away from the rapids.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.290" offset="15112547">In that sense, it wasn't a use of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.999" offset="15127385">In the sense of a port site or a power site, it was a substitute for the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.129" offset="15147865">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
