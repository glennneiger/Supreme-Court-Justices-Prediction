            <text syncTime="10.153" offset="143966">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.059" offset="155564">This case arises out of a conviction for murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.673" offset="174059">In the course of procuring that conviction, the State of California, subsequent to the arrest of the petitioner and subsequent to the time when she was represented by counsel overtly.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.981" offset="215333">Planted in her cell was an agent of the prosecution, a policewoman, posing as a narcotics addict who had supposedly been confined by the State, in order to overhear, listen and stimulate conversation from the petitioner which it hoped it would be able to use to incriminate her at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.538" offset="293491">As a result of this stimulation, certain statements were made which are characterized as admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.345" offset="316792">The petitioner denied her guilt but admitted the motive to the crime at least as to its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.006" offset="343437">This is not a usual uxoricide.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.315" offset="356603">The precedent in this case was a dentist.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.361" offset="368828">The defendant or petitioner his wife and an affair had been going on involving an attorney named Hayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.782" offset="406549">The death occurred as a result of a fire in a Volkswagen Sedan on the early morning hours of October 8, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.653" offset="438000">As of the moment of that death, there was on the record a series of decisions dealing with this very problem including specifically Massiah against the United States, Escobedo against Illinois and McLeod against Ohio applying Massiah to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.092" offset="499754">Within 24 hours or so, this petitioner had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.582" offset="513651">The police filling that circumstantial evidence, pointed to the fact that she had set the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.110" offset="535803">A large part of this was evidence of her affair with the attorney named Hayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.457" offset="557223">At the time of her arrest, she was met at the jail by an attorney of her own selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.336" offset="580733">She was booked for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.538" offset="593481">The police attempted to interrogate her.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.346" offset="604766">Counsel objected to interrogation following arrest and following representation by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.494" offset="633396">In order to protect her from interrogation, they set up a 24-hour watch at the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.446" offset="657115">This all began on October 9th, the day following the murder --</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Bailey</label>
            <text syncTime="144.616" offset="681880">Several counsel for petitioner -- counsel being unable to remain awake 24 hours must have some of his colleagues to assist him in the watch and protect the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.134" offset="723884">At 11 p.m. on October 9th, the Sheriff whom I will presume had some knowledge of the decisions to which I have alluded deliberately inserted passed on unsuspecting counsel, his policewoman undercover agent into the cell of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.555" offset="793579">Her instructions were to listen to what petitioner said and the State in its argument will represent that she in no way interrogated petitioner but was merely a listening post.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.223" offset="836315">She did not carry a recording device or transmitter of any kind.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="187.321" offset="852616">Is this before or after the state court injunction?</text>

          <turn speaker="lee_bailey" startTime="192.026" stopTime="252.851">
            <label>Mr. Lee Bailey</label>
            <text syncTime="192.026" offset="871528">Both Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.146" offset="875917">Before and after the state court injunction because nobody knew at the time the injunction was issued that the spy was in the cell and the State did not disclose it to the judge who gave the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.112" offset="919803">Among the things which the undercover agent did in order to stimulate remarks by the petitioner that might be of evidentiary value are the following: First, she said and this was a deliberate lie as she admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.765" offset="974451">She had overheard man from the District Attorney's Office say Arthwell Hayton came in today and blew the top off this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.170" offset="1008097">She then presented petitioner with a newspaper clipping furnished her by the sheriff or his agents and said, The publicity is ruining you in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.742" offset="1050311">She related that from her experience as a criminal, she had caused a distrust lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.024" offset="1071417">Suggested that petitioner distrust her own lawyer and further suggested that the sheriff was a nice man and should be trusted by petitioner and that she ought to talk to him.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="252.851" offset="1114781">Is that -- is that all uncontradicted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lee_bailey" startTime="256.421" stopTime="470.730">
            <label>Mr. Lee Bailey</label>
            <text syncTime="256.421" offset="1129096">It is uncontradicted, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.831" offset="1134738">The State has seen fit to furnish an extensive appendix of testimony and the testimony of Peggy Fisk at the trial is included verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.841" offset="1166712">I think there is no dispute that these things were done and that they were done at the specific or general insistence of her superiors, the sheriff and his agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.934" offset="1207150">Now, Mrs. Miller did say, I did not set the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.043" offset="1223555">It was accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.112" offset="1227839">And she has stoutly maintained that that was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.999" offset="1243408">But she also said that she was still in love with Arthwell Hayton and this immediately after her husband's death and that she felt that Arthwell Hayton would come to her at an appropriate time, that she hope to take the insurance money, $100,000.00 which was carried on her husband and take the children to Europe although it was explained that this was to avoid being crucified by the society that had put her to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.490" offset="1353331">At the time of trial, the Government proposed to use this tainted evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.378" offset="1380916">I point this out because the harmless error rule which is at issue here today has been carved out in my judgment and from a reading of the Chapman and Fahy cases and the notions expressed therein in order to avoid summary reversal where a comparatively minor piece of evidence is led in through a blunder on the part of the prosecutor or the part of the judge and an expensive retrial needs to be avoided because no substantial prejudice results.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.154" offset="1488018">But I do point out that these were two deliberate violations at two separate stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.342" offset="1508707">The sheriff by circumventing her right to counsel and knowingly injecting a spy into a cell where she was confined against her will.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.600" offset="1545801">And second, by the prosecutor in offering testimony which he well knew at that time presuming he could read and understand the principle behind the Massiah, Escobedo and McLeod, well knew to be illicitly gained on the cheat and deceptively nonetheless wish to use because he felt that would show her guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.029" offset="1623437">Anomalously, the prosecutor comes before this Court and says that the evidence was unnecessary and not prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.515" offset="1649455">I do point out that no other evidence demonstrated Mrs. Miller's alleged continuing love for the paramour Hayton after her husband's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.269" offset="1688430">Something calculated to enrage the jury and presumably since it took three days for this jury to decide the case, somebody was enraged because the verdict was conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.181" offset="1732106">At the time that the evidence was offered, the defense counsel exhibited some surprise and said, Well, I have never interviewed this witness as it is my right and I object that this was done in the lobby but it was done on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.678" offset="1786128">And he was permitted to interview the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.707" offset="1798248">But prior to doing so, he pointed out to the Court, this evidence is inadmissible and he cited the very decisions that I have mentioned here and also People against Dorado, the California decision on the Escobedo principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.756" offset="1854360">Interviewed the witness in the following morning, the prosecutor put her on the stand but before that happened, the defense counsel said to the judge, It is unfair to make me object before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.371" offset="1892812">Obviously, they might draw some inference that I am keeping out a confession or an admission that the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.179" offset="1924054">And he said specifically and this is in the record, Judge you know that it isn't right to make me do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.927" offset="1947042">And the judge said, We must put her on.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.987" offset="1955297">Have a preliminary foundation laid and an objection at the proper time, it cannot be done in the absence of the jury.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Bailey</label>
            <text syncTime="512.525" offset="2153514">Now, because the counsel always carries the dual burden of protecting a record and persuading the jury of his client's innocence if he can, this counsel, Mr. Foley, felt that the ruling of the trial court that he must object in the presence of the jury was incorrect and that he had preserved his rights for appeal as I suggest he did and therefore, he did not take that objection in order not I think, to cause the jury to suspect that something meaty was being kept from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.942" offset="2267094">From these circumstances, two questions had been accepted by this Court for a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.153" offset="2284022">Was the procedure by means of which these admissions were obtained by the State of California an unconstitutional violation of petitioner's rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="554.865" offset="2322787">First not to incriminate herself under the Fifth Amendment and second her right to have counsel present any time an agent of the Government interrogates after she has been arrested and has counsel under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.461" offset="2373256">It was admitted by Peggy Fisk, the undercover agent that she had no time to disclose her identity, the nature of her office and did not advise petitioner that she had a right to have a lawyer present during these conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.901" offset="2422993">If it is a violation, the question is then taken for consideration of decision as to whether or not this can ever be a harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.437" offset="2453086">Within the meaning of harmless error as it has been described in the decision in Fahy against Connecticut and Chapman against California.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.121" offset="2515884">It's always -- practically always true, isn't it, that an objection to the admission of evidence, it can be thought to have an adverse effect on the jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="699.797" offset="2902601">I think the principle of Jackson against Denno is applicable and I think that because jurors do not necessarily understand the machinations of the rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.106" offset="2935829">If counsel wishes to state his position which is probably the better procedure at the sidebar instead of giving a speech in front of the jury and to make his objections there that he may properly do so and the judge refuses to let him is forcing him to prejudice his case in front of the jury simply because they don't understand rulings of law and we should presume that they don't at least not in our cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.346" offset="3016808">Now, the third issue was offered to this Court and that is whether or not assuming that it were found that harmless error could occur with respect to admissions whether or not the error in this case was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.596" offset="3061739">That issue was rejected and is not before the Court and so the further facts of the case which are recited by the State of California to the tune of about 250 pages, trying to show that the error was not harmless, will not be alluded to by the petitioner who believes that issue to have been deemed irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.068" offset="3139688">The question then before this Court is whether or not I take it to the State of California although it vacillates very sharply between its briefs and its letters to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.100" offset="3175737">In the final analysis at least does not approve this deceptive procedure and at one point said flatly in a letter the Court which we have quoted in our briefs and which is part of the record, we did not mean to say that this was not an unconstitutional procedure, we condemn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.941" offset="3255150">Assuming that it is a constitutional violation and I see no reason to quarrel with that if this were to occur today very obviously, it would be under the Miranda Rule that we are not favored with that because of the time of our trial, the trial was in January of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.667" offset="3314082">Nonetheless, under Escobedo and under Massiah which involved very similar circumstances and where there was counsel to represent the defendant, these procedures have been condemned to say that it is not a constitutional violation will invite this kind of deception every time law enforcement is frustrated by the rules that this Court has created to protect individuals who are subject to interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.979" offset="3419303">To go in through the back door demolishes any value in creating a strong front door and that is exactly what would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.762" offset="3446471">I see perilously little difference between my planting a spy in the District Attorney's office to pose as his secretary and steal his files and the sheriff planting a spy in a cell where my client is improperly held if she is innocent or being properly held is not suppose to pay a penalty because she can't make bail and taking advantage of that situation in a cheatful manner obtaining evidence he could not otherwise get.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.080" offset="3547721">If it is a constitutional violation could it ever be harmless, well, the Court has held I think pretty uniformly that confessions will not be assumed to be harmless and can admissions be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.335" offset="3596727">This type of admission certainly can never be harmless because it is an admission to the motive in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.815" offset="3622640">The murder case of this sort is on shaky ground without some motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.316" offset="3636642">Obviously, if the State had been faced with a situation where two happy church going people with a stable family, a nice community position, wound up in a burning Volkswagen and the wife escaped, they would have a pretty poor case for murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.177" offset="3692126">Well, the state -- the state brings to our attention a great deal of evidence in addition to the petitioner's statement in which she supposedly -- which supposedly indicates that she was having this relationship with the other man.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.078" offset="3767672">But the question before the jury was did she on the night in question have sufficient malice in her heart and sufficient motive to burn her husband up, her contention was that this affair had terminated and was not a motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.062" offset="3811662">The only piece of evidence that clearly contradicted her testimony was the testimony of Peggy Fisk saying, I still love Arthwell Hayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.832" offset="3842696">If the jury believed that, the motive was a continuing thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.904" offset="3855026">If they did not, they might have had a reasonable doubt as to whether this affair had terminated and having had that dealt the result would have been quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.519" offset="3885432">If the Court were to say that there can be harmless error in admissions, I think a number of serious problems would crop up.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.165" offset="3912077">It would require a case by case adjudication and an onerous burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.798" offset="3930572">It would tempt law enforcement to use tactics of this sort in the fun hope that perhaps on appeal, this would be deemed to one of the exceptional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.381" offset="3968920">And I think that either of those procedures would hurt not only the cause of justice but the consistency of our constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.362" offset="4000789">Now, very frankly, the best rule would be in my judgment to absolutely deter conduct of this kind because I'm very fearful of the analogous case where the evidence is not used and the counsel never learns that a spy has been used in the cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.413" offset="4065050">Would the fruits of those conversations if they led to other evidence, unconstitutionally obtained, be improper and how would the defendant ever know it?</text>
            <text syncTime="999.193" offset="4100159">This prosecutor elected to use the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.939" offset="4111130">If he had not, the petitioner might never have known about Peggy Fisk and conceivably could have suffered damage as a result of the violation never recorded and never brought to her attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.082" offset="4155747">I believe that it should be stamped out of that level but if not, if this conduct is permissible, if law enforcement officers may make the attempt to put spies in cells because some people can't make bail because the charges capital or because they don't have money then they will certainly do so if the Court gives one wink of approval on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.487" offset="4245295">And then we must always decide whether or not if they don't use the evidence, they are within the limits of constitutional doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.595" offset="4277791">If they do use the evidence, this is not the kind of blunder, the kind of mistake made in the heat of trial that the harmless error doctrine was made to accommodate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.721" offset="4322304">It is certainly true that after a three-month trial with a very minor slipped of the tongue which is corrected by the Court, a prosecutor statement might be deemed harmless error even though it fell within the preview of a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.955" offset="4371205">But where the deception and the violation in the first instance was deliberate and conceived as an effort to get around the exercise of a constitutional right, and then where the use of the evidence by a knowing lawyer who presumably understood the law and was willing to run the risk of reversal to have his jury conviction injected that evidence over objection before the jury then we have a two stage deliberate violation that this Court need never protect with a harmless error exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.511" offset="5933432">Now, the conduct that was referred to in that letter was the conduct that was brought out by defense counsel on cross-examination of the undercover agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.265" offset="6000410">And the defense in that cross-examination never developed the fact that the statements that the prosecution introduced into evidence were provoked by this conduct of the undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.730" offset="6066343">The prosecution initially put the witness on the stand and asked the circumstances under which she had been placed in the jail cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.280" offset="6100511">And immediately thereafter, asked her if she had any conversations with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.583" offset="6133739">There was no question regarding -- questioning of the witness regarding a process of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.601" offset="6161742">The witness merely testified as the certain statements made by the petitioner in the fact that she had been separated from her husband, they had reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.149" offset="6203956">She respected him but she loved Arthwell Hayton and still loved him and was going to Europe with the insurance money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.965" offset="6239274">Now, before this evidence was introduced, the defense took the witness on voir dire examination and established one that she had not been warned of her constitutional rights by the undercover agent nor have the undercover agent told her that she was working for the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.378" offset="6312835">At that point, the voir dire examination was terminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.951" offset="6343137">Instead, the prosecution was permitted to go ahead, introduce the statements and then the prosecution promptly closed and did not have any extended examination on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.263" offset="6392456">The cross-examination was commenced by the defense counsel and he developed in his first questions that this undercover agent had been instructed when she was placed in the jail cell and it should be emphasized that she was placed in this jail cell prior to any charges having been filed in the court of law against her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.318" offset="6480645">The undercover agent was in the jail cell prior to any complaint or indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3697.608" offset="14893850">I will not meet the legal arguments advanced by my brothers since I think they have been covered. But he has demonstrated confusion as to the facts that I think worth straightening out. First, it was suggested to Mr. Justice Marshall that the record was vague as to when this woman was taken out of the jail and the record is not vague at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.894" offset="14962918">She was there from the 9th to the 15th and no evidence to the contrary was ever given or suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.085" offset="14987682">Second, he suggests to this Court that no reports were made after the State of California ordered its own officials not to interrogate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.905" offset="15019029">Unknowing at the time that a spy was already in the cell, told the sheriff to stay away from the petitioner, told her attorneys to stop protecting, Peggy Fisk says, "I made reports on the 12th and partly on the 14th after that injunction was issued and in flat contempt of the municipal court."</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.878" offset="15098859">The State of California says that the prosecution never suggested to the jury as a result of the Fisk testimony that the defendant or petitioner had a continuing motive to marry Arthwell Hayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.950" offset="15151208">From its own appendix in the final argument of the prosecutor and I quote, "She testified that she love Hayton, that she wanted to marry him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.422" offset="15189034">She testified that her love for him died at that same time her husband died.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.455" offset="15205230">I'm not sure what that would have to do with it at any rate."</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.464" offset="15217246">That's her testimony but that's not what she told the girl up in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.071" offset="15235636">She told the girl up in the jail that she still loved Hayton, felt that he would come to her, very obviously just the opposite of what Mr. Griffin has represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.285" offset="15284537">The letter which Chief Justice has alluded to, set forth in part in our brief was provoked by this comment in a reply brief filed by the petitioner after the State had opposed certiorari in its conclusion on page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.338" offset="15360711">It says in as much as the State of California took the position that it had no right to do this, to put spies in the cell as long as they did not overtly interrogate, which had statements elicited as a result of such a week long process can hardly be characterized "entirely spontaneous."</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.218" offset="15440227">They are the product of a carefully planned and executed process of subtle interrogation and trickery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.013" offset="15463424">The incredible fact that the highest law enforcement officer of this nation's largest state still regards this episode as proper in Constitution is adequate evidence that it must be authoritatively condemned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.786" offset="15518490">I have heard the State of California take both positions today but it is perfectly plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.717" offset="15538239">But unless that condemnation is forthcoming, Peggy Fisk will have more work in San Bernardino County and others in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.294" offset="15572511">Thank you.</text>
