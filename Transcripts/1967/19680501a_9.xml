            <text syncTime="54.912" offset="325110">Before I start, the State of Connecticut has agreed to allot seven minutes of its time to the Assistant Attorney General of the State of Iowa, Mrs. Lorna Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.291" offset="382579">Now, the factual situation in this case is quite simple and I don't think they are particularly in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.934" offset="417165">Ms. Thompson, the appellee who was receiving aid to dependent children in the State of Massachusetts moved into Connecticut and was refused public assistant solely on the basis of the residency requirements of 17-2d and I think that the only question facing this Court is whether or not a state may pass a reasonable residency requirement in the field of public assistance particularly aid to dependent children, a law that is clearly not racially aimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.602" offset="563869">A law that has no permanent effect on the persons aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.083" offset="581736">A law that has no criminal sanctions and one that involves the spending of state tax raised funds and one actually that encourages new migrants into the State of Connecticut to enter the labor market and parenthetically, if I notice in this last part that the Congress in H.R. 12080 of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 has followed Connecticut's very good lead in this case and their AFDC, Aid to Families of Dependent Children by establishing a work incentive program very similar to the regulations and policy of the State of Connecticut set up and the residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.395" offset="795000">I noticed it's called Work Incentive Program probably the nickname for that would be WIP but I wouldn't want to use that connotation in front of the Court when I'm arguing this type of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.155" offset="998024">Now, it was always in my belief that the fundamental and central historical purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to protect persons from statutes that were first racially aimed and that seems to be what this Court has dealt with in the last few years and also cases involving acquired property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.302" offset="1082661">However, I think that the Fourteenth Amendment in this case has been used to paraphrase Dr. Samuel Jackson as the last refuge of the constitutional bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.755" offset="1132398">It has been used when the appellees could find no true legal precedent on which to base their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.429" offset="1167088">Now, Judge's Smith and Judge Blumenfeld when they wrote their majority opinion in the Thompson case was a vigorous decent from Judge Clary conceded that the purpose of Section 17-2d was to protect the public purse of the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.130" offset="1257890">A purpose which I always thought was wadable but they didn't went on to indicate that the State of Connecticut had not born the burden of proving that this was justifiable purpose or that the classification was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.002" offset="1325390">Now, since when does a state bear the burden of proving that their statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.175" offset="1366141">It was stated in that Darlington case every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of the statute and this continues until the contrary is shown beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.201" offset="1410236">When one looks at the memorandum not only in the Thompson case but in the Harold case and the Smith case, the companion case that to be argued here today, it is plainly apparent that the judges based their decision, however, benevolent and well meaning that it might be on their own personal, social philosophy and then went out and actually looked in vain for any cases that could support --</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.044" offset="4973547">Mr. Chief Justice and other justices of the Court may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.076" offset="4997684">I'm glad that my associate in this case is the main counsel of course, didn't hang his head entirely on the redheaded matter because I think that would be arbitrary and discriminatory but that isn't this particular kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.842" offset="5064767">I'm also glad the he didn't hang his head entirely on the economic problem although that is one of the things that's involved but there are other considerations before this Court and that has to do with the whole fundamental reason and purpose of Aid of Dependency Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.314" offset="5138641">It stand the course from the Federal Government prior to the Social Security Act in which this particular law was available to states who could qualify or willing to qualify the matter of welfare and helping the poor was on the conscience of those people in their local communities under the police powers though that type of help still continues in Iowa and I'm sure it does in the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.263" offset="5246474">During this period of time while residency is being established for ADC, I took that time in my appendix to show the Court those particular laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.793" offset="5288584">The Board of Supervisors provide that kind of help for the indigent whether or not there are minor children involved who haven't lived in the state for a year or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.793" offset="5332574">The -- I mean I read yesterday really quickly, the briefs of a legal age societies and the church groups, my heart really was touched as I'm sure this Court says that this particular program does not cover every type of situation nor was it designed to cover every type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.516" offset="5411464">It was designed to cover a place where the children could be brought up as our children are brought up in a community where instead of just bread and butter money and milk money, they have some professional legal counseling which our Federal Government provides funds for, our state, the government provides some funds for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.687" offset="5516163">And we do this to the people who have shown that they really want to be a resident of our states and how do they intend, how do they show that intention?</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.262" offset="5562452">Up to the time of a year, they have -- they are in dire need of welfare, they are as I said on the police powers taken care of by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.444" offset="5599232">But if they show that they really want to be -- live in that state, make it their home which they have a right to do, then, they can qualify because of that one year residency for aid to dependent children if otherwise qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.622" offset="5675928">Therefore, I'm glad co-counsel said there are other considerations besides economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.955" offset="5697243">This is an overall program where the children are tied to a community where the people care about them, where we are more or less tied because of our occupations in rearing our children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.683" offset="5748130">We are not free because of law of business in my case and other jobs, the machinist and seniority rights and the factory workers to move freely from state to state when they have young children to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.618" offset="5799852">They're more or less tied because that's what they want to give to their children for security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.790" offset="6056584">The Aid to Dependent Children Law came in many years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.123" offset="6069959">Before that time, they were just dependent upon having local relief under the police powers of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.207" offset="6098275">But the hour at the moment is second highest in the amount of money paid to these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.692" offset="6128159">You see, when this federal law was passed, it was saying to the states such as Iowa who is depending on local relief to help the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.528" offset="6175493">If you folk want to help children to live in your community and become an integrated part in residence there and they show that they want to be residents by being there a year and if you will, if you will do these other things, we will match the money, we will match your money at 50/50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.876" offset="6268907">In Iowa, it comes right from one-fourth of that 50% provided by the state, comes right from the county where the people are residents from local taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.079" offset="6321779">The other one-fourth comes from general appropriations by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.532" offset="6347588">If this Court were to strike down this law, you would not Your Honors be helping the other people for whom this law was designed because our legislature considers the people by case load past experience in determining what they're asking for the legislature is going to be and when the legislature meets and on a long projected basis as a family plans for its purchases over the few years to come as a corporation plans for few years to come as a state must plan for a few years to come, what the needs are going to be so that they know how much money they'll be able to afford, there is just so many people included in that give or take level, there's a little margin but in Iowa, even when those girls move to another state because they were in that appropriation in that projected calculation for one year if they need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.840" offset="6612783">In another state in the Code of Connecticut and before they qualify in Connecticut or wherever they will have a residency law, Iowa continues to pay and Iowa is second from the top in the payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.306" offset="9466608">Now, Catholic Family Services voluntarily provided assistance at a level below the level that the appellee would have received from the State of Connecticut for approximately 23 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.793" offset="9516554">It should be pointed out here that it's in the transcript, the part of the unprinted record from the District Court that the Commission of Welfare in Connecticut states quite clearly that this is a unique situation that private charities cannot be called upon to render this type of assistance today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2383.098" offset="9637763">Now, Connecticut has a basic welfare statute which is 17-85 which provides that any relative having a dependent child who is unable to furnish suitable support therefore in his own home shall be eligible to receive AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.553" offset="9719683">It should be made clear that the child gets the benefits derivatively through the parent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.042" offset="9749567">The child has no status to apply individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.813" offset="9772659">Now, this means that if you turn to Section 17-2d that even though a person is without -- is unable to furnish suitable support for the dependent child that that person will not receive assistance for the period of the Duration of Residence Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.978" offset="9873283">Now, on its phase, Section 17-2d makes ineligible those new residents who arrive in the state without visible means of support for the immediate future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.996" offset="9925423">Now, as this statute has come to be administered, pursuant to regulations drafted by the Commission of Welfare and these regulations are set forth in the brief and in the printed appendix, benefits are denied all new residents in Connecticut for a period of three months regardless of under what circumstances they have to the stay for three months, they are denied with benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.416" offset="10047049">Now, after the three-month period is up, the person who enters the state either with a job or with sufficient personal resources to have supported himself and his family for a period of three months is then eligible to receive assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.011" offset="12753439">And in that particular point, we would rely expressly on the Court's theory in that case where they said as I've stated that the settlement law notions no longer have any place in our system and that in fact, this is exactly what Connecticut is trying to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.359" offset="13346837">The classification is drawn -- clearly drawn in the basis of wealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.244" offset="13370347">It's drawn in the basis of when the person has a job, whoever person has sufficient resources to support themselves for one year and that clearly as this Court has held in the line of cases emanating with Griffin that that is clearly a classification between rich and poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.316" offset="13454670">Now, when I use the word rich, I may be using inadvertently but it is certainly a classification drawn in the basis of wealth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3786.132" offset="15249910">This is the second of the three related cases before the Court today, dealing with the constitutionality of residency requirements for public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.043" offset="15313544">This case I think, presents the question in a little cleaner posture than the case which has just been heard and that the statute in the District of Columbia makes a classification between those who have been here for one year and those who have not, clean across the board without ifs, ands or buts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.210" offset="15434230">It applies to all five classifications or categories of public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.010" offset="15477488">It is unlike the Connecticut statute in that way and the statutes of many other states that have subclassifications within the single classification of a one year residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.301" offset="15542585">Now, of course residency requirements are not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.579" offset="15567768">46 of the 50 states have a residency requirement for at least one category of public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.887" offset="15608936">Many of them as the District of Columbia have a residency requirement for all categories of public assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3912.921" offset="15757103">As we see the problem presented in this case, it turns upon what standard is to be applied in judging this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.921" offset="15805064">Now, this Court over the years has have run out to general standards toward judging the constitutionality of legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.958" offset="15857204">That is what I would call the general standard which is applied in most cases and under that standard, the Court has said that legislatures have a very wide scope of discretion in classifying the citizens in the two different classes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4915.911" offset="19769093">But from the practical standpoint, the states want the federal funds so they have cut their residency requirement down to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.369" offset="19806919">Now, that -- it may have been the intention of the Congress in enacting this legislation to make the residency requirement which it was permitted of all states, a one year residency requirement the same as that in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.883" offset="19872956">But again, I cannot point to anything specifically in the legislative history which would support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.945" offset="19909214">Now, there is the contention made here by the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.250" offset="19934396">It has been made in the other three cases here of the right to travel, freedom of movement argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.533" offset="19967519">Now, it does not appear that the majority of the Court here expressly relied upon that ground and declaring this statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.802" offset="20012659">Their stated ground was Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.353" offset="20046827">But their reliance upon such cases as Edwards and Kent, Aptheker, I think clearly indicated that at least as an alternate ground or perhaps a part of their original ground, they were relying upon a violation of the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.347" offset="20142853">Now, that comes back to the appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.698" offset="20156228">The argument is made here that the standard which this Court has applied in First Amendment cases is the proper standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.374" offset="20202935">And I think I would have to concede that if the Court is to judge this legislation by the standards that it applies to a legislative Act which infringes directly a First Amendment right of association, communication religion that it could not stand out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.164" offset="20290079">The question is, is that the appropriate standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.625" offset="20303872">And I think there is where the court below went off and the courts in the other cases which stricken down such legislation have gone off.</text>

            <text syncTime="5370.522" offset="21587529">There were four appellees; one as the Court knows recently passed away, three of them, all but one Vera Barley who was residing in St.Elizabeth's Hospital came to the District of Columbia from Arkansas, New York, South Carolina respectively for reasons which are elaborated in some details in the complaints and in the affidavits to support a motion for preliminary injunction which is part of this record and we referred to them extensively our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5415.331" offset="21766729">Mrs. Harold came here because she was ill with cancer and she had three children and she wanted to be assured that her brother and her sister could take care of those children if something happened to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.240" offset="21822422">Ms. Brown had been here on a numerous occasions before had gone to school here and was returning here for very good reasons because she was unable to live in Fort Smith, Arkansas anymore because she was not eligible for public housing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5754.816" offset="23124679">It must be reasonably related to lawful governmental purpose and I upsize two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.499" offset="23155399">One, reasonably related and the second, a lawful purpose because as I will demonstrate shortly, it is we believe in some respects not reasonably related to some purposes and in other respects, it is reasonably related to a purpose I believe but I think that purpose is clearly unconstitutional per se so it must meet those two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.413" offset="23251111">Now, I think the lines are fairly, clearly drawn here on the question of the approach of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.024" offset="23297505">Mr. Barton has conceded of course that if the Court would adjudge the statute and understand this strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.470" offset="23335330">Now, our contention is that this case should be judged by those standards and I would not concede at all that we're judged under any standards, it would fall because I think it's going to be clear that they're just on any lawful objectives at all that it has been offered or that can be drained up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.992" offset="23417354">In any event, it seems clear to me that the standards that should apply here when this Court used this case are those strict standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="6708.151" offset="26938034">If a person is a resident in the sense that he has come here with the present intention of staying, he is going to be getting his public assistance checked here and spending it here and he meets all the need requirements, I think that person is being discriminated if some arbitrary period is selected.</text>

            <text syncTime="6790.891" offset="27268953">Now, if I could briefly turn to what I think is the critical and really clenching point in this case and that is the justifications and I think it's well to point out initially that when you're talking about justifications and searching for purposes, this Court has said on numerous occasions on Allied Stores versus Bowers, Mr. Justice Brennan's concurring opinion and Mr. Justice Douglas' dissenting opinion in Martin v. Walton, Mr. Justice White's concurring opinion in Griswold.</text>
            <text syncTime="6824.677" offset="27404163">When a purpose is offered up by the state, by the legislative history or by departing defending the law, that's what you look at and after all, that's only reasonable because that is really the purpose why the law was passed for the Court to consider some completely different purpose and uphold the law on that basis within some respects, required the Court to consider matters of legislative wisdom and so on, which the legislature never has in which presumably legislators should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6858.167" offset="27538119">Now the purpose is there's no secret about the purposes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.032" offset="27549508">They've been offered up and I might say that there's almost been some gamesmanship around the country in the last six months as you know in numerable cases that have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.230" offset="27598305">Who can think of a purpose to defend their law that is not unconstitutional under the Edwards case?</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.788" offset="27624532">And several had been served up.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.597" offset="27635816">Now, the one which, although there is no legislative history on the matter for the reasons we suggested in our brief of the one that is obviously I think the purpose of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6898.693" offset="27700182">The basis for passing this law is the old settlement concept which changes somewhat in this country and became residents and I think the fact that there isn't any legislative history and we trace it back to the first time it seemed to have come in into the district in an AFDC in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="6917.277" offset="27774579">It's because this is just the way it's always been and this matter of the history has been very carefully treated in the amicus brief filed here by Center on Social Welfare Policy and Law in their first appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="6931.345" offset="27830794">Now, this purpose is asserted by the state and it really -- there are two branches of it but I think it boils down the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6939.766" offset="27864440">One, you keep out paupers and the other you save money and of course you don't do the first just for the devil of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6945.458" offset="27887219">You do it because you're interested and not having to take care of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6948.853" offset="27900803">And I think one that that's just been settled by Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.786" offset="27920551">I think this Court has said that that's just not a legitimate consideration for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.945" offset="27941240">It simply cannot serve that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.910" offset="27957018">California had far more problems back in the 30s as the Court acknowledged in its opinion and I'm sure Washington DC has.</text>
            <text syncTime="6970.145" offset="27985962">But you just can't offer that and furthermore as we pointed out, it's extremely speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6975.248" offset="28006442">In fact the District Court founds a fact that it's just wasn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.389" offset="28018981">All of the evidence that was marshaled by either side in the court below and the Court here, I think quite decisively shows that there's no problem along this line in any event in terms of people migrating so they want to get money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.917" offset="28073106">Now, the second point which the Court made or rather the appellant made here to justify is this argument of an objective test of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7002.277" offset="28114484">Our answer to that is it's not unconstitutional per se such as the objectives in terms of Edwards but it's unconstitutional because it sweeps far too broadly and when basic rights were involved, the Court has simply -- the state is simply going to have to find something that's a little more specific and deals with the specific problem in terms of funding residence and I don't think there's any difficulty in finding residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="7029.512" offset="28223467">After all, anyone here replies entries being here more than a year to undergo some routine check and he says that he's a resident but presumably the state has to check that out too and they all get their checks within a month as they required to --</text>

            <text syncTime="7102.451" offset="28515203">I accept -- what I accept are the judicial opinions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals which define residence generally as varies from case to case but generally a person who is physically here and has an intention to remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.399" offset="28583016">Now, if a state had a general law which said nobody in the state for any purposes a resident unless he's been here a year, I think that would be open to constitutional attack in a case such as this where that's the only reason why a person does not get benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="7135.556" offset="28647696">So I don't think and I also want to just refer the Court to its opinion in Harman versus Forssenius, the Virginia toll tax case which I think is clearly this positive of using objective test of residence in this sense because that's what Virginia was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="7151.991" offset="28713420">We want to use this just to determine objective test of residence and the Court referred to that as a remote administrative benefit which wasn't go in to get in the way of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="7161.619" offset="28751872">Now, the only other purpose that has served up is really not a purpose at all but one which says you don't have to have any purpose and that's this right privilege argument that's a fortuity and so the Court can sort of look at anyway it wants, it doesn't have to have a purpose and I think that's just been thoroughly rejected by Sherbert versus Verner and it's just foreclosed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7180.745" offset="28828359">There are other purposes that had been offered not in this case and therefore I don't think the Court can look at it and I believe that those are treated particularly in Pennsylvania's brief that we also mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="7225.622" offset="29007872">We discussed and rely upon in our brief that's relegated to a Footnote in the appellee's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7234.169" offset="29042145">Their argument is that that was decided way back in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="7239.442" offset="29063147">It's per se now it's on law.</text>

            <text syncTime="7251.220" offset="29110272">Flemming versus Nestor dealt with a provision of the Social Security Act which cut off assistance benefits to any person who is deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="7266.283" offset="29170563">Now, the fund from which the payments were made there was one into which the applicant had paid funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="7276.071" offset="29209746">It's unlike the situation here where you have a pure fortuity, the person had, well something close to a contractual interest in these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="7290.750" offset="29268470">The Court nevertheless said, particularly when we deal with a withholding of a non-contractual benefit under a social welfare program such as this, we must recognize that the Due Process Clause can be thought to interpose a bar only if the statute manifest patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="7437.689" offset="29856225">The United States Congress in the legislation which enacted the Social Security law allows residency requirement to be enacted by the states of up to one year in duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="7451.093" offset="29909828">Relying upon that, the general assembly of Pennsylvania and the legislatures of some 45 other states have determined in their judgment that a residency requirement is proper in public assistance statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7470.918" offset="29989136">The residency requirement in Pennsylvania, applies to all types of public assistance and welfare benefits with the following exceptions and I believe that these exceptions are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="7486.106" offset="30049844">First of all, under the recently enacted medical assistance program, the United States Congress has provided that there shall be no residency requirement and therefore under the medical assistance program in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania does not have a residency requirement.</text>
