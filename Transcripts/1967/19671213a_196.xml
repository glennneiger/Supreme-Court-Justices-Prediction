            <label>Mr. John Caughlan</label>
            <text syncTime="14.504" offset="161416">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.316" offset="184613">Mr. Schroeter yesterday outlined the basic societal values which we believe are at stake in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.763" offset="226408">First, the primacy of the individual embodied in concepts, including the First Amendment; secondly, the fairness of governmental procedures embodied in concepts in the Constitution which include the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.500" offset="297357">One additional one should be added to that and that is the guarantee of governmental integrity which is embodied in the concept of the separation of powers in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.907" offset="362977">We feel that this is based upon fundamentally the societal understanding that man is fallible, that power corrupts, and consequently includes basic principles such as the division of the three branches of government and specific provision of the Constitution including bills of attainder, a prohibition against them, recognizing that judicial process should govern any question of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.374" offset="484916">The civilian control of the military because men trained in authority can sometimes to be insensitive to the relationship of the individual in exercise of their rights that we cherish.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.344" offset="556701">And finally, that the power of the governments may not be delegated one to another and that legislative enactments and administrative rules carrying out those enactments must have the clarity and precision particularly in relations in touching upon these other fundamental rights, so that the individual can understand and that the democratic values of society maybe preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.650" offset="709987">With respect to the last, we believe that the regulations in the Act which is before the Court fails in every particular and has the fatal vice of vagueness which this Court has spoken off in many recent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.988" offset="807372">The regulations which I wish briefly again to refer to Mr. Schroeter did yesterday, the regulations, first of all, and these appear in our brief on page A14, the ones that I'm about to refer to, provide that at every stage of the proceeding in determination of an applicant to a Coast Guard whether he can receive special validation, the Commandant must be satisfied, that his character and habits of life justify beliefs that he will not be inimical to security.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.961" offset="967241">That's -- an additional regulation provides that if the inquires that the Commandant makes of any applicant are in any way incomplete, that the Commandant may obtain under oath additional information.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.648" offset="1045922">And finally on page A14 Regulation 12105 (d) (2) that if any applicant fails to furnish such additional information that the Commandant may require, he may hold the application totally in abeyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.881" offset="1122931">This is the situation which we have here that no further action would be taken and in each case that the mandatory criteria which may preclude satisfaction includes the satisfaction of the Commandant, the absolute authority in him to determine that the individual is not inimical.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.102" offset="1211747">Now, under this procedure Mr. Schneider was submitted a questionnaire which was referred to yesterday which required him in effect to construct his own loyalty oath, that is to set forth in detail his association with every organization on the Attorney General's list, to set forth in detail his activities, his reading, in connection with the People's World, and to detail his present attitude to --</text>

            <text syncTime="349.947" offset="1503169">His present attitude towards the Communist Party was one of the things it would require and their principles, his attitude or the principles and objectives of that party, his attitude towards the form of the government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.769" offset="1562415">For the reasons that are already been stated to this Court, Mr. Schneider having and feeling it was impossible to have an idea of what was required, refused under penalty of perjury to construct in effect this loyalty oath.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.063" offset="1803577">So, I would believe Mr. Justice Black that this wouldn't virtually be impossible for anyone to answer.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Caughlan</label>
            <text syncTime="435.179" offset="1844120">The Paper itself has 15 to 20 volumes, of thick ones and I just can't imagine how long it would take it, I believe it would be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.917" offset="1895006">Although this question -- these inquiries appeared in the guise of a questionnaire, we feel that they are indistinguishable in the inner impact and effect from the construction of a loyalty oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.951" offset="1963133">And indeed a loyalty oath that is far broader than anything has ever come before this Court which has been considered in the teacher-public-employee cases, the oath required public workers and has been denounced in the line of decisions which extend from Cramp to Shelton, although that is a slightly different type of oath, to Baggett, to Elfbrandt, to Keyishian, and the case decided this term Whitehill versus Elkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.083" offset="2103672">The underlying purpose, it seems to us of each of these procedures, the questionnaire we have in this case, the teachers and public employee oath that we have in the other cases is an attempt on the part of perhaps well meaning that we believe misguided public officials and legislatures to weed out dissidents, persons who disagree or wish to disagree with the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.457" offset="2233240">It's no accident, we think that in each one of the cases that have come before the Court, these had been answered previously, the actions had been instituted by teachers who are sincere and thoughtful people and have opportunity and time and consideration to understand the full implications of this oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.486" offset="2317354">And perhaps it's no accident that this comes up before -- this case come before the Court from a seaman who we believe is unquestionably sincere also, but who is not in the status of a teacher who wished to sail and who therefore attempted his best to meet the initial procedures until he has submitted the questionnaire which is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.186" offset="2420067">But as this pointed out by Mr. Justice Douglas in the Elfbrandt case, it is the sincere, the persons of integrity who do bring these cases who needs oath to effect because others can construct their answer false oath or they do not have the sort of integrity and sincerity which is required, or which persons who present the issue for public consideration and consideration by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.453" offset="2553187">But it's precisely the same compelled conformity which is before the Court in every instance, and here we have clearly a situation where the interrogatory procedure takes the place of the oath procedure in the teacher cases, where the determination here is whether, if I can put it this way, the applicant to the Coast Guard's point of view has what we would call a bad First Amendment character because of his associations, because of his reading, and because of his attitudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.720" offset="2714206">Therefore, we feel that the statement ultimately made by this Court last Monday, in the decision to the Robel case, is particularly applicable here that it would be ironic if the name of National Defense, we would sanction subversion of those liberties which we cherished and which make the defense of the nation worthwhile.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.687" offset="2814098">And these points to the origin of the vagueness which is before this Court which is found in the Magnuson Act itself because the Magnuson Act authorizes, in it's principle amendment to previous legislation, was to authorize rules and regulations, to authorize procedures by the President when he found that the country was endangered by subversive activity or subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.064" offset="2967594">This word itself as indicated by its use in the Robel decision is a word of the widest meaning, generally it means bad politics, bad from who's point of view, bad in that it may subvert constitutional principle, bad in someone else's mind because subversion may mean refusal to conform to the status quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="814.630" offset="3361938">And in this amplified by the interrogatories which require the applicant to explain in detail his relationship to any organization which he belongs and I might add in this case, this includes on the Attorney General's list which had promulgated long after some of the organizations to my knowledge had become defunct such as the Washington Common Law Federation which in the State of Washington if one were to include sympathetic associates of that, would include most of the public officials during one period of time or many of them, most of the democratic officials that included such organizations as the labor schools, the Seattle Labor School, the North Pacific Northwest Labor School which was facultied by numerous teachers at the University of Washington, it includes the Harry Bridges' defense committee which presumably ceased to exist after his defense became unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.170" offset="3612087">But these all appear on the list along with many, many other organizations and I would assume that in most of these cases, the applicant in this case who is an alert person and was aligned during the period of time when this happen, must have had not only membership, but sympathetic association, affiliation or even sympathetic association with these organization which is also included.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.957" offset="4083231">Now the only difference that we see here is that instead of saying he must deny the application, it says he may deny the application, but in the context of these regulations we feel that it is most unlikely that an administrative official would approve an application of someone who didn't disclaim present sympathy or association or sympathetic attitude toward any of these organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.915" offset="4219068">We feel that the Commandant would feel impelled that he must ask the question under the regulations, would feel that any sympathetic relation to these organizations would atomically preclude denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.055" offset="4271626">That would be argued no doubt that he may approve, but we believe he would only approve if the applicant had somehow disclaimed knowledge or repudiated the organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.930" offset="4771088">Now, let me spell it out on some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.879" offset="4786866">The Magnuson Act enacted in 1950 is simply an additional two paragraphs to an already existing Act, the Act of June 15th, 1917 enacted two months after the commencement of World War I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.883" offset="4878921">This -- the first two -- the first paragraph which appears as appendix A1 of our brief authorizes the President, in case of war or national emergency with proclamation, declaration of war, disturbance of international relations to take full possession of all foreign or domestic vessels and remove there from members of the crew who aren't especially authorized to go aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.206" offset="5012146">It is clearly and unmistakably a war power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.169" offset="5024057">It's one of some 13 titles in what in effect is the War Powers Act of 1917 and applies only in case of a national emergency or in cases of a proclamation based on disturbance of international relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.140" offset="5107963">The Magnuson Act adds to this power which the President has under emergency or war situations, the provision that whenever the President finds security endangered by reason of subversive activity, he maybe do two things; part A, with respect to foreign-flag vessels only, he may place guards there on, take full possession of the vessels that he wishes, and remove all persons not especially authorized by him to go aboard those foreign-flag vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.692" offset="5274102">Secondly, and as the second part of the Act and independent from this and separate from it, it gives the President the power to safeguard against destruction, loss or injury from sabotage, subversive acts, accidents or other causes of similar nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.663" offset="5358007">The maritime facilities of the United States, and it was indicated by Senator Magnuson and no doubt of course, that the government has a very direct interest in protecting these facilities, just pointed out that no authority existed to protect docks and so forth in time of danger and in the argument before the Congress which is set forth in -- which is referred to in our briefs, this was the principal basis for this addition of the Magnuson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.627" offset="5489873">It says nothing about removing members of crews and we believe there is nothing in the history of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4747.148" offset="19091937">I think that this is an answer -- this is a question to which the Commandant has the right to expect an answer so that he can make the reasonable investigation of this man and to determine whether or not a special validation should be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.996" offset="19159333">I think that is the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.170" offset="19176051">Now, I would like if I my at this point to turn briefly to the question which Mr. Justice Harlan asked concerning the delegation of a power to the -- whether or not the Magnuson Act authorized this type of program that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.077" offset="19243656">I think the answer to that is that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.544" offset="19249507">I think the Congress was acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.462" offset="19257240">Unfortunately there is not a great deal of legislative history because this was an amendment to existing legislation that was passed during the Korean crises, but there is some history which I think is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.200" offset="19304155">This is an Act which was passed amending existing legislation and under to that existing legislation there had been during World War II, screening program from merchant seaman which had been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.617" offset="19361834">At the time the bill was introduced in the Senate, Senator Magnuson informed the Senate that the purpose of this bill was to allow the President to institute security measures similar to those adopted during World War I and World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.828" offset="19426722">So I think that fact indicates that Congress contemplated some type of screening procedure similar to that used during World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.538" offset="19461517">Second, I think that in the use of the words, the President has delegated the power to make rules and regulations, to prevent sabotage and espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.385" offset="19504880">How do you -- what rules and regulations do you adopt, why does the common sense meaning of those phrases when put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.770" offset="19530480">It seems that to prevent sabotage and espionage, you have to do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.574" offset="19557648">You have to deny access to those places that maybe subject to those activities; one, to the people who might engaged in it and two; to the materials that might be used to carry out those activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.142" offset="19615953">So, I think that just on a reading of the language that it contemplates that rules and regulations are going to be adopted to exclude people from areas where sabotage and espionage could be engaged in.</text>
