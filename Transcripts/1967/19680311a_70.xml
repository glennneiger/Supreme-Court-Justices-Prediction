            <text syncTime="42.671" offset="274056">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.692" offset="290147">This case involves the interpretation of a treaty of the United States, commonly known as the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.649" offset="322017">Very briefly, the Warsaw Convention is a multi-nation agreement which has two basic objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.802" offset="354617">The first of these is to minimize conflicts of law which arise in the international transportation by air, of passengers, baggage and cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.267" offset="396413">The second objective and probably the more important, is to establish throughout the world the uniform rules relating to a liability of the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.440" offset="445106">The fundamental question which this case present to the Court, is whether these treaty is to be interpreted and applied in the United States, on a basis of purely local concepts of law and policy and in disregard of the international obligations of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.023" offset="535489">The facts which give rise to this question are not in dispute and maybe briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.392" offset="564955">Respondents brought damage actions in the District Court in connection with an accident which occurred in Ireland in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.867" offset="598810">These actions were brought in behalf of 13 passengers who were killed, injured and some suffered property loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.710" offset="634232">At the time of the accident and again this is not in dispute each of these passengers was traveling on a passenger ticket and baggage check which provided for international transpiration within the meaning of Article I of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.879" offset="698911">By this fact alone, all of the provisions of the treaty apply to the rights of the parties to the damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.328" offset="740707">In answering the complaints, the petitioner alleged several affirmative defenses based upon those provisions of the treaty which subject to proof by the carrier limit or exclude to carrier's liability for the damages claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.371" offset="824822">Upon motion of respondents, District Court granted partial summary judgment dismissing these affirmative defenses holding that the treaty provisions limiting liability do not apply unless the carrier has given the passenger notice of the application of these provisions to his transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.905" offset="923042">On appeal of Court of Appeals affirmed in a two to one decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.799" offset="946552">The court below has held that this treaty in United States shall not apply insofar as limited carriers liability unless the carrier has notified the passenger before him that on a journey he is about to undertake the treaty applies and limits his liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.159" offset="1032025">We submit that this decision is in direct conflict with the intent of the parties to this treaty as expressed in a plain language of the treaty itself and confirmed by its drafting history.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.736" offset="1542353">Am I correct in remembering that the Solicitor General does not take the position that the Court of Appeals heard no one stated anymore strongly than that but that's not the way I read it.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.420" offset="1705044">The court below in the finding in Article III a requirement of notice is acting in direct conflict with the plain language of that Article.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.224" offset="1752273">Treaty says that in two situations and only two situations, the provisions excluding or limiting liability shall not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.840" offset="1794696">The first of these is if the carrier is guilty of willful misconduct and we are not concerned with that in this case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.135" offset="1831894">In a transportation of passengers, the second situation is if no passenger ticket has been delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.311" offset="1864600">At the court below has read in to the treaty a third situation and has said that in the United States because of our legal system which requires notice of limits of liability where you seek to limit liability by contract at this treaty shall apply in United States to require notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.537" offset="1961566">Plain language of Article III expressly limits the imposition of this sanction to the case of none delivery of a ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.500" offset="2005347">Article III also states that the irregularity of the ticket shall not to protect the application of the provisions of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.796" offset="2042546">When we contrast this with two other articles in the treaty which I related in our dealing with the baggage check in airway bill we find that the draft is imposed the same sanction where none delivery of the baggage check or none use of the airway bill as in the case of the passenger ticket but the scope of the sanctions is in more contrast.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.663" offset="6790040">Second part of United States proposal was, that the sanction on Article III be extended from its 1929 language, to cover the situation where the passenger ticket did not contain this notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.958" offset="6847195">The third and fourth parts of the proposal related to the sides of type, notice should be a minimum type size, so notice should be in contrast in color.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.066" offset="7875688">And what it did was impose a limitation of liability in exchange for an elusory presumption of liability, the carrier updating $300.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.131" offset="7923858">And did give anything else but imposing this limitation which benefited only the carrier, because there's nothing in the treaty that benefits of passenger and I say that advisably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.373" offset="7972864">They -- there was one quid pro quo as the court below found and that is you must deliver a ticket to the passenger that has certain basic information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.197" offset="8020198">And actually this treaty also is not self-executing, it doesn't automatically impose itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.044" offset="8063561">It's faced on upon a contract between the passenger and the carrier, which contract must say certain things in order to determine whether the treaty applies where the two countries parties to the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.769" offset="8138480">You have to look at the contract, you have to -- in order to determine what the carrier is you have to look at the contract, in order to detemine where if there's an accident to bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.396" offset="8204936">A matter of fact that was another right they took away from the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.819" offset="8218624">Ordinarily, as well established, if you have an accident its transitory and you bring an action wherever you find them and they eliminated that right or they eliminated very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.118" offset="8847862">Well, to a particularly situation to determine whether the carrier has given a proper ticket to the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.191" offset="8880149">For example, the ticket is issued from country A to country B, or county A to county B and then back to country A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.512" offset="8937409">Now country B is not a party to Warsaw Convention but country A is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.176" offset="8960084">So there the stopping place -- intermediate stopping place would be material because the convention says that if there is a stop in the third country which is not a party of the convention then the convention applies, otherwise if does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.458" offset="9025181">So otherwise it's domestic transportation because there's no intermediate stop at the third country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.092" offset="9047751">So therefore in that case, stopping place would be material but however if you have, let's say a trip in New York to Mexico City and there intermediate stops in the flight let's say Washington-Nashville and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.769" offset="9110444">They live out the intermediate stopping place Washington-Nashville, but if the passenger is going New York to Mexico City, well, the fact that they left out those stopping place a material because you got New York-Mexico City that determines the Warsaw nature of the transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.862" offset="9470830">Now, it is -- I believe well worth pointing out to the Court that the defendant Alitalia really recognized the necessity of delivery of a ticket which is a contract ticket to the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.900" offset="9559019">When in its completing affirm that defenses to this action it said that Alitalia alleged that the transportation was being performed pursuant to contract made with each of the plaintiffs.</text>
