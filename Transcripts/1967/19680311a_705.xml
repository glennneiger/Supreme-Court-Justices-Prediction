            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 705, George William Bruton, petitioner versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.745" offset="226304">Mr. Reardon?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_p_reardon_jr" startTime="32.080" stopTime="609.453">
            <label>Mr. Daniel P. Reardon, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="32.080" offset="231737">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.449" offset="245217">The question presented herein is whether or not the petitioner, George William Bruton was substantially prejudiced when his jury heard an implicating admission illegally and unconstitutionally obtained from his co-defendant one William James Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.796" offset="326510">The two men were jointly tried with the robbery of a postal contract station.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.018" offset="351483">The robbery occurred on April 16, 1965 in South St. Louis on South Kingshighway.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.251" offset="392338">William too and the evidence disclose two Negroes entered the Robinson Jewelry Store.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.893" offset="422954">Mr. Robinson was repairing watches in the rear of the store while an employee by the name of Ms. Miller was attending to other business behind the desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.471" offset="469243">She approached the two men as they entered and began to wait on the man later identified as Evans, William James Evans and showed him some engagement rings, subsequently showed him some watches.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.656" offset="529951">While displaying the watches for Mr. Evans, Evans displayed a revolver and she looked back to the front of the store, wherein the second Negro later identified as Bruton was also displaying a revolver.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.802" offset="598601">She was ordered to the rear of the jewelry store where Mr. Robinson -- where she and Mr. Robinson were bound and order lie face down.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.848" offset="646771">The evidence disclosed that she, Ms. Miller observed Mr. Bruton for a period of some two minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.206" offset="676237">The evidence further disclose that she had seen the co-defendant Mr. Evans in the store that it was a store that normally catered to White individuals and to see a Negro was something extraordinary, that she had seen Mr. Evans on some eight or ten prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.905" offset="750947">She had never seen the individual identified as Bruton prior to the two minutes during the course of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.867" offset="778846">The robbery produced among other things $30.00 in postal contract funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.423" offset="801102">The individuals left the Robinson Jewelry Store on Good Friday, April 16, 1965 and the evidence thereafter concerning the investigation switches until the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.665" offset="865991">Again on Good Friday, this time April the eight of 1966 wherein Mr. Evans was placed in a line up by the St. Louis Police Department and identified by both Ms. Miller and Mr. Robinson as having been one of the perpetrators of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.728" offset="942268">He was then questioned on several occasions on that particular day, April 8, 1965 by Detective Farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.488" offset="977272">He denied involvement in the postal contract station robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.803" offset="994617">As a matter of fact, Mr. Evans at that time was a prisoner of the State of Missouri being held in the city jail, awaiting a trial for armed robbery for the robbery of the Western Union station.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.023" offset="1043414">He is a matter of fact at that time and to the knowledge of Detective Farmer had an employed attorney by the name of Alfred Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.053" offset="1083538">Detective Farmer learned this on April 4, 1966, four days before the line up that occurred on April the 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.831" offset="1118647">After several series of questionings, Mr. Evans, the co-defendant admitted and gave to Detective Farmer what he termed confidential information wherein he admitted having perpetrated the robbery of the Robinson Jewelry Store and also implicated Mr. Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.953" offset="1207150">There was no warning given him with regard to his constitutional rights. Mr. Harris, his employed attorney as of prior to April the 8th was not informed with regard to the interview that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.851" offset="1262738">But in any event, the scene now switches to April the 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.397" offset="1280920">Mr. Evans, the co-defendant was transported back to the city jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.466" offset="1297220">He remained a prisoner of the State of Missouri but on April the 11th, Detective Farmer had summoned and brought with him a postal inspector by the name of James Thorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.907" offset="1342986">Mr. Thorn then administered a constitutional warning to Mr. Evans in the presence of Detective Farmer and obtained from Mr. Evans an admission that he had in fact perpetrated the robbery of the Robinson Jewelry Store.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.654" offset="1418010">This admission was adduced in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.755" offset="1430444">This admission did not implicate Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.354" offset="1444760">Now then Detective Farmer with his confidential information which did involve Mr. Bruton finally arrested this petitioner, petitioner Bruton on April the 25th and summoned Ms. Miller to the police headquarters to view Mr. Bruton the petitioner in a line up.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.893" offset="1526993">Now Bruton had previously been placed in a lineup and viewed by Ms. Miller in November or December of 1965 and she at that time failed to identify Mr. Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.876" offset="1582895">Mr. Robinson was not brought to the lineup of April the 25th because he did not see the second man allegedly Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.014" offset="1615391">In any event, Ms. Miller was able on the second occasion to identify Bruton and he was charged with this offense, the robbery of the postal contract station.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.507" offset="1661367">Now then on May the 4th following the charge against Bruton, Inspector Thorn again returned to the city jail, again advised Evans as to his constitutional rights and on this occasion, the second interview by Mr. Thorn, he obtain from Evans an admission wherein Evans implicated Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.733" offset="1762304">This admission together with the first admission was objected to prior to the trial in a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.502" offset="1793337">Some question was raised in the Eight Circuit as to why a severance was not requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.975" offset="1819251">In any event, I did not in behalf of petitioner Bruton request a severance and my research since the time of this Eight Circuit argument reveals that since I have been I have been admitted to the Bar, since 1955 and until Mr. Bruton went to trial in the eastern district of Missouri and the eastern division, no severance had been granted to any defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.579" offset="1913710">But be that as it may, the Eight Circuit did in fact hold that the Evans admissions were poisonous and reversed this -- the case as to Evans alone and then relying upon this Court's opinion in the Delli Paoli case affirmed the conviction as to Mr. Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.602" offset="1993749">Mr. Evans was in fact retried and found not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.876" offset="2018826">The Eight Circuit noted in its opinion that the evidence with regard to Mr. Evans, the identifying evidence, it was much stronger or was stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.021" offset="2059473">It was in fact when two witnesses identified Mr. Evans rather than one when each of the two witnesses that identified Mr. Evans claims that they had seen him prior to the April 16, 1965 date in this jewelry store.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.433" offset="2133138">But in any event, the decision as to Mr. Bruton was affirmed relying on Delli Paoli saying that the jury -- presuming that the jury could in fact follow the Court's instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.467" offset="2185279">As a matter of fact, it was argued to the jury jewelry that the only purpose in the world of Mr. Thorn, the postal inspector had in making a second visit to city jail after he had the Evans admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.259" offset="2248391">The only purpose of the second visit to the city jail was to prejudice Mr. Bruton, was to corroborate the weak identification case against Mr. Bruton and this in fact he was able to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.638" offset="2313906">The Eight Circuit's reliance on Delli Paoli I submit is ill founded for two principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.969" offset="2351208">Number one in the Delli Paoli case, the court reviewed as a matter of fact the evidence and found the evidence against that defendant was very strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.446" offset="2393109">The evidence against Bruton suggest -- I suggest weak at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.749" offset="2414320">The second and more important reason why Delli Paoli is improperly relied upon; there was no question as to the admissibility of the admission in the Delli Paoli case.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.794" offset="2462595">In this case, the admission of Mr. Evans or the two admissions had been in fact declared unconstitutionally obtained, unconstitutionally obtained in violation of the Westover case which followed and was decided along with the Miranda decision at about the time or just shortly prior to the time this --</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.665" offset="4954049">I would point out that as recently as two years ago, the Court amended the rules of this Court, Rule 8 which allows joint trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.107" offset="5015803">These are the rules of criminal procedure and it was not amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.022" offset="5035447">Rule 14 which provides for motions for separate trials was amended by adding a paragraph or adding a sentence which reads in ruling on a motion by a defendant for severance, the Court may order the attorney for the government to deliver to the Court for inspection in camera any statements or confessions made by the defendants which the government intends to introduce in evidence at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.508" offset="5169403">As of that time, the Court did not see fit to change the rule so as to provide that there must be separate trials if there is a confession by one defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.460" offset="5241187">We recognize of course that the application of the rule of Delli Paoli is a matter of some difficulty and that it is addressed to the sound judgment and discretion of the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.031" offset="5323525">We think that in this case under the circumstances as they have finally worked out, that it is not appropriate to seek to support the conviction of Bruton obtained in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.621" offset="5381831">There are a number of reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.004" offset="5399385">One is the fact that the other evidence against Bruton was rather slim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.759" offset="5426448">He was not identified by one of the witnesses who did identify Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.324" offset="5448704">He was identified by another witness, but that witness had failed to identify him in a lineup some months before he was arrested and there are some aspects of the testimony of that witness which lead one to think that the suggestion which came from seeing him in custody may have had some unconscious I am sure influence on her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.795" offset="5582555">We have then the fact that the confession of Evans was held to be inadmissible as to him, a factor which was not present in Delli Paoli and which I --</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.145" offset="5679940">I think that we are in an area where maybe logic chopping may not be exactly what should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.570" offset="5709615">And when I add to all of this, the fact that thereafter Evans was retried and this was not known when the government's brief in opposition was filed in this case, Evans was thereafter retried and on the evidence which was available against him without the confession he was acquitted and at this point which is the point when I first came to consider the case, I found that more than I felt I could conscientiously undertake to do to say that pure logic must prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.269" offset="5856423">We must go through this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.073" offset="5867708">It could not of that any bearing with respect to Bruton and though his co-defendant is now completely discharged from this offense, nevertheless the conviction against Bruton must stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.367" offset="5932805">What I would have felt if the evidence against Bruton had been really strong, if there had been numerous eyewitnesses and fingerprints and an article of his clothing had been found at the scene or something like that, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.382" offset="6004903">It is an element in my thought here that the other evidence against Bruton was in this case rather slim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.218" offset="6044296">I know that the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals has reviewed that evidence and found it sufficient, but they did point out in a Footnote in their opinion that in making that review, they took it most strongly in favor of the government and it is not clear to me that that is an appropriate way to deal with that evidence in the particular facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.003" offset="9255372">I do not know how many of them involved the use of confessions which are admissible against one and not against another, confessions or statements made during the course of the conspiracy are admissible against all defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.363" offset="9680854">My impression would be but I have no facts that this not happen very often, but that on the other hand, it is not a rare thing which happens only extremely occasionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.742" offset="9750340">I think it happens often enough to be a significant matter and when it does happen however, all of the other facts differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.026" offset="9787434">I think if we get a case as Delli Paoli was where the other evidence against the defendant named was overwhelming where the evidence was presented quite separately with very specific instructions by the court at the time it was presented and also in the chart that there is much to be said for the result which was actually reached in the Delli Paoli case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.022" offset="9911463">And let me point out too that if the Court starts down the road of saying that instructions are not enough, juries simply cannot keep these things separated and act in accordance with the instructions that a good many other problems will arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.876" offset="10014908">That would seem to me and I think that any evidence that got into the record that was inadmissible, any hearsay which the witness blurted out and the court stopped the witness and then instructed the jury who will disregard the answer to that question.</text>
