            <label>Mr. William E. Kelly</label>
            <text syncTime="39.755" offset="262353">Please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.299" offset="272593">I represent the petitioner Patricia Waldron the Executrix of the estate of her late husband Gerald B. Waldron, who is the original plaintiff in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.984" offset="323271">For the purposes of simplicity the parties on this appeal continue to refer to Mr. Waldron as the petitioner or the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.347" offset="368724">A word of background; in 1951 Iran nationalized its oil resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.926" offset="399026">Up until this time and for many years the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, one of the defendants in this action, now known as British Petroleum had operated the Iranian oil industry under a long term concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.707" offset="462242">The act of nationalization in effect kicked the British out.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.385" offset="484916">The British retaliated and in this case when I refer to the British, I refer to the British government as well because British Petroleum is 51% owned by the British government, retaliated by a boycott on Iranian oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.743" offset="542386">The other defendants in this action who are the international major oil companies respected this boycott with the result that the Iranians from the spring of 1951, indeed throughout the entire period of time we refer to were unable to sell any oil in the world markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.866" offset="610826">In 1952 plaintiff who conceitedly did not have any experience in the oil business up to that time nonetheless obtained a contract from the Iranian Government allowing him to purchase an enormous amount of oil, 50 million metric tons of oil at significant discounts below the posted Persian Gulf prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.718" offset="710196">Thereafter he attempted to sell this oil in the United States approaching over 50 independent oil companies and he was unable to sell a single drop of that oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.417" offset="753037">One of the companies he approached was the respondent Cities Service and it is that particular aspect of the case that is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.704" offset="790235">His contract expired in the summer, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.636" offset="817925">The action itself was commenced on June 11, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.620" offset="837883">It is of course an action, treble damage anti-trust action, a private antitrust action.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.231" offset="864319">Almost immediately the defendants claiming one case at least that they never heard of plaintiff obtained a stay of plaintiff’s discovery in order to permit them to depose him and to frame answers in response to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.977" offset="935267">That stay which was obtained in early July 1956 has been enforced throughout the entire ligation, 11 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.488" offset="969331">It in enforced today but plaintiff has been under that state for the entire period of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.058" offset="995558">He has had no opportunity to conduct any general discovery whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.074" offset="1095659">I will return to this point in a moment Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.810" offset="1102660">I just want to lay out the overall action and the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.576" offset="1121677">In 1960 while the plaintiff was still under this stay and after the plaintiff had been deposed Cities moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.583" offset="1161697">This motion was adjourned several times to allow plaintiff to conduct limited discovery of Cities Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.495" offset="1197328">The motion was finally granted in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.666" offset="1214046">Appeal followed to the circuit court and certiorari was granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.705" offset="1234213">We make three points on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.851" offset="1242781">First of all that it was error for the district court to limit plaintiff's discovery throughout the entire course of this litigation and particularly when he was forced to oppose a summary judgment by Cities Service, that is point one of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.079" offset="1307669">Point two of our brief is that in opposing this motion for summary judgment, the burden of showing treble issues of the fact was placed on the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.106" offset="1351764">It should have been placed on the defendant, who in his papers utterly failed to negate the allegations of conspiracy and it is that we claim as the second error, that is point two of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.202" offset="1404217">Point three of our brief is even on the limited facts that we have been able to gather in the course of the 11 years, we nonetheless believe we make out a case for the jury on the conspiracy issue against all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.183" offset="1464090">Now let me go back and give some of the background facts.</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Kelly</label>
            <text syncTime="358.218" offset="1536293">Yes the plaintiff was boycotted completely from selling his oil that he had under this contract in the United States and I'll develop that point, I am just coming to that point factually right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.431" offset="1585089">Time will not permit us to discuss all of the incidents, but there are two that I think bear reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.814" offset="1610585">As I said before when he obtained this contract in May of 1952, plaintiff immediately got together with a number of other people, 4 or 5 in number and approached over 50 independent American oil companies and asked them, would they be interested in purchasing oil that he had under the contract from the Iranian Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.150" offset="1691982">Universally without exception, all refused to deal with him when they heard where the oil was was coming from.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.531" offset="1725524">In good deal we've citied in our four or five specific examples one went even so far of putting a letter saying that the threat of retaliation by the majors is too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.812" offset="1766588">Now one of the background facts is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.965" offset="1779231">I think it is important for the Court and I am sure it probably understands it anyways that 99% of the world's oil production is under the control of the six or seven defendants in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.385" offset="1828864">The international major oil companies, all other independent oil companies have to purchase their oil from these defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.402" offset="1960939">The rest of the case is pending and this -- so what you have to do, am I correct in assuming on what you have to do here is to make a case for relief that you seek against Cities Service itself.</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Kelly</label>
            <text syncTime="484.472" offset="2041292">Cities in the facts that I'm beginning to state aren't disputed by Cities, I am coming to the peculiar role of Cities in this particular matter in a moment otherwise the overall conspiracy is assumed for the purpose of this motion and then we have to deal with Cities as a particular exception I began to point that out I'll come to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.597" offset="2117778">I think I had just reached the point where I said that none of the independent oil companies would even take this oil because they were afraid of losing the supply that they would obtain from the major oil companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.239" offset="2164276">One particular example of how the cartel, if you would please, touched the plaintiff was in the spring of 1952, plaintiff was required to obtain a letter of credit under his contract to purchase oil from the Iranian Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.431" offset="2237106">He went to the Chase National Bank now known as the Chase Manhattan Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.841" offset="2254764">He was on the verge of receiving a letter of credit when a telephone call came into the Branch Manager telling him we can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.421" offset="2289037">Chase is unable to do it because it has preferred customers in the oil business.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.142" offset="2311920">Branch Manager very excited and went downtown met the Chase Vice President and this Chase Vice President told him that one of the preferred depositors or customers of the Chase Bank was a major oil company, the Gulf Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.912" offset="2379003">Colonel Drake had issued instructions, Colonel Drake being the Chairman of the Board not to give plaintiff a letter of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.308" offset="2404603">This is the way, this is the background fact, I don't think it's too important but it gives you an example I think of how this thing works.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.284" offset="2432502">Now coming to Cities; Cities was not a major international oil company in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.024" offset="2459460">It was a deficit oil company.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.565" offset="2465625">It had to purchase oil from the majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.420" offset="2477014">It had purchase one half of its daily requirement from the majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.404" offset="2496972">One of plaintiff's associates had been a former employee of Cities Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.972" offset="2515257">He suggested that they go to Cities Service to see if they would be interested in plaintiff's contract to purchase Iranian oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.164" offset="2543992">They went into see plaintiff -- they went into Cities, and Cities was vitally interested in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.884" offset="2574921">There was meeting between plaintiff's associates and several of this Cities Executive Officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.376" offset="2596864">Plaintiff was asked, could he go to Iran where he had been to obtain this contract originally where he met the high officials of the Iranian Government including Premier Mossadegh, could you obtain an invitation to W. Alton Jones, the President of Cities Service inviting Mr. Jones to Iran?</text>
            <text syncTime="641.758" offset="2670425">He said he could, he'd try it, went back to Iran, obtained the invitation, brought it back and delivered it to the Cities Service's officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.754" offset="2702399">Jones was delighted at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.489" offset="2713370">Immediately, he moved the Cities Service executive personnel to see what could be developed with this opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.649" offset="2742000">A working party was formed consisting of three experts in the production, refining and distribution areas and they together with Jones and plaintiff and plaintiff's associates left for Iran where there was a three or four week inspection of the Iranian oil facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.546" offset="2805530">One of the things that was prepared by one of the Executives of Cities Service was a draft report, a secret report laying out how Cities could use this opportunity to ensure a long-term supply of oil and they made no bones about it this time, this was a tremendous opportunity for them at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.910" offset="2894973">They went to Iran.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.551" offset="2901556">Now this received a considerable amount of publicity back in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.985" offset="2919320">I don't know whether the Court remembers it or not, I vaguely do myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.885" offset="2938964">When they got to Iran there were rumors of this, that the plant, the Abadan Refinery had been sabotaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.661" offset="2966026">They went around and they looked at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.845" offset="2970728">This was the purpose of the inspection tour and they found that everything was all right, there was no particular problems at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.717" offset="2998209">The opportunity was there, there were no obstacles in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.464" offset="3013256">They met with Premier Mossadegh.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.942" offset="3023182">Jones had an oral conversation with him, outlined his findings, promised to give Mossadegh a written report upon on his return to the United States, and with this they came back to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.466" offset="3089220">Now there's one incident that I want to call to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.414" offset="3113044">Kuwait Oil is in this case and we will hear a little bit about it later.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.194" offset="3132165">Kuwait is a concession, Kuwait concession is operated, it's little bit below Iran on the Persian Gulf is operated by British Petroleum and Gulf jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.856" offset="3182843">In the middle of these negotiations in Iran, unknown to plaintiff, Jones secretly went down to Kuwait.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.274" offset="3220459">what happened there, we don't know, we don't have any idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.859" offset="3246791">In 1960, this is very important because it was expressly denied by Cities that Jones had gone to Kuwait, the very time this motion was made, I'll comeback and explain the significance of that in a moment because Jones' affidavit was never, never submitted on the summary judgment motion that is this that what we say, this is manner we say that Cities never negated the conspiracy in this case, the allegations of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.602" offset="3561827">Jones returned to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.980" offset="3561723">On the way to and from the United States, he met with the gentleman named Sandberg in Holland.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.800" offset="3561618">Now, we don't know Sabdberg's role in this case either except Watson, Cities Executive Vice President believed him to have a connection with Royal Dutch Shell one of the co-conspirators in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.194" offset="3561514">We don't know whether he has that connection or not, an affidavit has been submitted by Mr. Sandberg in which he denies any such connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.567" offset="3561409">What is known is that Sandberg is the head of one of the leading private banking houses in Holland, Pierson &amp; Heldering.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.231" offset="3561305">The affidavit that's submitted by Sandberg doesn't say what Jones discussed for five days on his way to Iran or in the trip back.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.846" offset="3561200">Again, we say this is most significant, we don't know what occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="872.705" offset="3594219">However, at this time there began to be an outcry against Cities activities in Iran.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.398" offset="3624939">The American Petroleum Institute convention in November 1957, excuse me, not 1957, 1952, Jones went to that convention bearing in mind that he's a deficit oil company.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.633" offset="3685857">We have in the record what occurred an admission by one of the Cities' personnel to plaintiff and the quote is in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1051.385" offset="4308929">This contract was finally executed in January 1953, I'll come to that again in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.534" offset="4345501">At the same time Jones began to take the position that the only honorable solution to the Iranian situation was to compromise with the British and he wrote such a letter to incoming Secretary of State, Dulles and incoming Secretary of State Brownell (ph), he had kept the United States government informed what his activities were during his period going down to Washington, meeting with President Truman before he went to Iran.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.272" offset="4548420">One significant recommendation was that the Iranians like the Mexicans in 1938 could begin to develop their own oil markets that would take them much, much longer but there was no obstacles to that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.394" offset="4604949">This report was never sent so far as we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.020" offset="4623444">Plaintiff's contract expired in June of 1963 as I indicated before without him selling any oil whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.452" offset="4657194">The action was brought in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.006" offset="4667434">The stay of discovery immediately imposed and plaintiff's depositions begin some 60 some, some 62 or 63 deposition sessions were held between 1956 and the end of 1958 at which time the plaintiff moved in the district court for an order terminating his deposition compelling the defendants to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.412" offset="4765027">They now knew enough about plaintiff to surely submit answers to the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.023" offset="4831483">Judge Herlands not denied the motion, but he then increased the term of the stay upon plaintiff by now giving defendants, although they hadn't ask for it at all, the opportunity to depose all of plaintiff's associates and send a schedule of a 174 days to complete the deposition, the cumulative depositions of plaintiff's associates and in addition asked everybody how many more days they needed to depose the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.036" offset="4955512">I think the total came to 60 some odd sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.634" offset="4965857">Now the entire schedule was filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.979" offset="4983306">Plaintiff was in fact only deposed for 30 some odd sessions more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.267" offset="5000443">The witnesses' depositions I believe consumed some 50 to 60 days, 60 deposition days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.994" offset="5031372">In any event, the plaintiff's deposition ended finally in I believe it was January or February of 1960.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.060" offset="5079646">Plaintiff is still under the stay that I referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.589" offset="5097723">The motion is an interesting one because Cities took the position at this time that since plaintiff had admitted in his testimony, that the two items, that he saw in the newspapers in 1954 and which caused him to think, he had particularly no idea about this before, an announcement of the purchase of oil by Cities from Gulf, which had begun in 1952, and the fact that the Cities had gone into the Iranian consortium, which was the ultimate solution to the case, the ultimate solution of the Iranian situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.268" offset="5272430">These two events are what caused the Cities, they were reason that caused plaintiff, they were the reasons why plaintiff brought this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.792" offset="5302523">Cities therefore focused just on these two issues in attempt to disprove them as if they were essential question in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.259" offset="5340453">A motion came on to be heard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.864" offset="6274800">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.995" offset="6295385">The case that I've just heard argued is somewhat different from the case to which I have spent about 11 years of my life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.134" offset="6339897">The plaintiff had been represented until this argument by the late Mr. Samuel Lane, who is a very able, very resourceful lawyer, in addition if I maybe allowed to say a very gallant gentleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.164" offset="6404054">He has been lost at sea and on one have seen him for sometime, I assume his death is now presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.411" offset="6429027">So I shall assume that those departures from what happened from the story of this case to which my learned friend has just treated this Court are the result of a lack of familiarity, he not having participated in the many, many hearings, the many, many debates, the many, many briefs that have been exchanged, that I shall narrate in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.569" offset="6541667">But unless the force of what I want to say be forgotten I should like to address myself before I make my organized argument to a few propositions which Mr. Kelly has adverted to before the effect of them is forgotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.669" offset="6602062">Number one, you were told that the plaintiff has been stayed to this moment from proceeding with his side of the case procuring an answer, or taking depositions, or doing anything of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.038" offset="6671548">It is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.119" offset="6683878">Four years after the case began in 1960, I stated orally to Judge Herlands, the trial judge who presided, that I wanted to go ahead with the case that apparently my learned adversary then preferred not to move it along, and that I thought the reason he didn't want to move it along, was that he was waiting for the United States government to try a oil case which it had started and hoped that (a) the government might give him the proof which he needed or (b) he might have the judgment which would dispense with the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.768" offset="6834448">But the government never went ahead with that case, incidentally Cities Service was not a party to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.021" offset="6863496">Now I did not expect in 1960 that in 1967 I would again have to tell a court that my learned friend does not want to proceed with his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.577" offset="6913651">He could have had his answers for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.615" offset="6925876">He could have had his depositions for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.571" offset="6937684">Volume IV of the transcript of this record, which is available to the Court is the monument to these self-inflicted delays, which my learned friend has suffered from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.646" offset="6989928">Incidentally, I should say to this Court that as far as Cities Service is concerned, we did not make the motion, which called for the deposition to which Mr. Justice Fortas has addressed himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.296" offset="7044577">It is true that a number of the other defendants who are still in the case did tell Judge Weinfeld who presided on that application that they had never heard of this plaintiff and that was a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.477" offset="7109256">He had never been in the oil business before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.937" offset="7119078">He was food broker in Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.709" offset="7134229">Cities Service had heard and had dealt with this plaintiff, consequently we were in no position to make any such declaration, but the other defendants made the motion and did persuade a very careful judge to allow them to examine first before they were required to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.627" offset="7213850">In the formulation of that decision I suspect that the -- then prevailing rule that he who first moved shall have priority played a part, but was by no means the only consideration, which moved the learned judge in making that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.329" offset="7288665">Now another thing that was referred to and I want to mention before I get into my argument is that the judges below that is both Judge Herlands who heard this case and the Court of Appeals that unanimously affirmed his judgment had imposed upon the plaintiff in this case the petitioner, the burden of demonstrating that he did have an issue, whereas he says the burden should have be been upon me to demonstrate that he had no issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.759" offset="7430457">My learned friend is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.427" offset="7441115">I remember as vividly as I now stand that before Judge Herlands I was obliged to demonstrate his lack of an issue to the point where I was asked to demonstrate the elimination of every possible hypothesis of complicity in this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.282" offset="7528469">That was the test which Judge Herlands imposed upon me, that was the test which he said, “I lived up to when I succeeded in procuring the summary judgment.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.661" offset="7818010">I have not discovered expect for this frivolous suggestion that the Second Circuit notorious for its restricted view of summary judgment has misplead that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.669" offset="7874017">Except for that frivolous suggestion there is no question of law here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.988" offset="7887287">We're all in agreement as to what the rules relating to summary judgment are and as far as I can understand the only argument that my learned friend may properly advanced to you is that in this case the district judge and the Court of Appeals has misvalued the information at their disposal in deciding that as a matter of fact the plaintiff had not demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.269" offset="8020407">My learned friend said in the course of his opening remarks that he wants us to assume for purposes of this motion that all of the other defendants are guilty of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.086" offset="8063666">Well, I must part company with him and I hope this Court will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.984" offset="8079339">I hope that we will not argue this motion on the assumption that all of the other defendants are guilty of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.253" offset="8108387">Suffice it, I should think to my adversary's case is that there is a pending case before the district court now un-disposed off, indeed unanswered in which he asserts the existence of a conspiracy on behalf of the -- on the part of the other defendants, and that matter is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.896" offset="8190934">That is per se or at least is in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.540" offset="8201488">It has not yet to put at issue because no answer has yet been demanded by my learned friend from the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.907" offset="8254986">Today I in my brief I suggested that there were three times at which plaintiff changed course and indeed the Court of Appeals in its opinion calls attention to the fact that at three different stages the plaintiff adopted three theories of conspiracy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.251" offset="8328338">Today for the first time I heard a fourth and today the fourth one was that Cities Service joined the conspiracy at some industry association meeting in November of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.362" offset="8392808">I'll simply say to Your Honor that this is the first time in all these many years that this motion has been pending and the motion was made in 1960, seven years ago and this is the first time de novo that I hear suggest that the conspiracy was joined in November of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.558" offset="8497612">The question was asked as to whether the rumor or the statement that was attributed to Mr Wetzel was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.161" offset="8528018">We had no opportunity Mr. Justice Fortas or an occasion at which we could have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.051" offset="8559574">We had hoped to be able to depose Mr. Wetzel but he died as have a number of other persons connected with case before his turn arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.603" offset="8597817">But it is not true that Jones began to take a different position after that meeting because the position that is attributed to Jones is one that he consistently maintains throughout as the district court and the Court of Appeals found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.135" offset="8675871">Now let me go on to the regular portion of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.237" offset="8712338">The action as you heard was instituted against seven companies, one of them Cities Service moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.404" offset="8744939">It was granted by Judge Herlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.564" offset="8757582">The others also moved for summary judgment, that you have not yet been told. Later in the proceeding, the six other defendants likewise made a motion for summary judgment and in the same decision which he looked with favor, but did not finally grant upon Cities Service motion Judge Herlands denied the motion of all of the other defendants, so that the action against them is still in effect and it was the granting of the motion in favor of Cities Service which was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.882" offset="8910869">Both courts agreeing specifically on this proposition, that there was no issue to be tried, no genuine issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.603" offset="8949739">But I think it is interesting if you will read the opinion of the Court of Appeals and of the district court, that they went beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.830" offset="8982653">They not only said that the plaintiff had not demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue, which they did so, but they also said that it appears plain that Cities had nothing to do with this conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2241.361" offset="9068857">But they, motion to dismiss was denied whereas our motion to dismiss was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.851" offset="9094771">I will develop it a little bit and you will see very conspicuously why that differentiation was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.943" offset="9143150">I assume that the legitimate errors of which my learned friend may complain here is two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.981" offset="9171257">First that the respondent has not in fact satisfied the requirements of the rule which must be met before summary judgment may be granted; and second that the trial court abused its discretion in limiting its deposition, its examinations of the plaintiff under Rule 56(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.580" offset="9265716">Now I should like to take a moment to emphasize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.872" offset="9278882">56(f) is a subdivision of the summary judgment rule which provides that if it appears that the person to whom the motion is addressed, is unable to furnish the necessary affidavits to resist the motion for some good and valid reason, the court may authorize him to take the deposition with respect to those matters that he says he wants to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.802" offset="9394552">That of course is an entirely different section of the rule from that which provides for general discovery, 26 Fd 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.096" offset="9431751">Now I would like to emphasize here that contrary to what my learned friend has said and contrary to what he says in his brief, the motion he made before the district court was for examination under 56(f) and not for the general right of examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.408" offset="9520985">Indeed I give you the record reference to that is transcript volume three, page 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.115" offset="9563826">He said he wanted an opportunity under Rule 56(f) to conduct discovery proceedings and when the Judge Herlands rendered his decision he said with respect to the motion under Rule 56(f) and when the Court of Appeals wrote its opinion it addressed itself to 56(f), but I go further and again I must assume that in this vast record of thousands of pages Mr. Kelly has not been able to familiarize himself with all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.302" offset="9688586">In the oral argument Judge Herlands addressed himself to counsel and said, “I call your attention to fact that 56(f) is more restrictive in scope than the general discovery proceedings under 26 and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.458" offset="9757236">Do you realize that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.600" offset="9765804">Mr. Lane said, “Yes, I realize it and I accept it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2544.650" offset="10281984">The judge said to him, “Start with Hill,” and I'll tell you why in a moment, but just let me answer Mr. Justice Fortas' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.827" offset="10314689">Then he came back with a new theory and that new theory, a new hypothesis of conspiracy justified a broader examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.213" offset="10356276">Whereupon Judge Herlands said to him, “I'll allow you to examine every living person who participated in the Iranian adventure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.416" offset="10405073">You can examine Mr. Watson, the Chairman of the Board of the company, Mr. Fried and Mr. Heskin and by that time Jones was dead and I'll tell you how that came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.652" offset="10490023">So that he had every examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.821" offset="10498696">When he finished with those he still produced nothing and he came back and he said well let me have a broad examination in Brooks and the judge said, “No, you had your chance,” and that was the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.189" offset="10548120">Now Jones, Mr. Justice Brennan, when this case was presented to the district court, it came up in the following manner and I think it is of the utmost gravity that we get – important that we understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.468" offset="10613217">The plaintiff in his complaint segregated Cities Service from all of the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.722" offset="10642265">He said that the other defendants engaged in a cartel, but that Cities was not a member of it, in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.259" offset="10668387">He said that the other defendants had conspired to monopolize the Iranian oil, but that Cities was not a member of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.182" offset="10700152">He said that the other defendants had conspired to boycott his oil, but that Cities was not a member of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.714" offset="10726275">He said that the others had conspired to prevent his access to the money market, but that Cities was not a member of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.141" offset="10755950">He said Cities joined the conspiracy and I quote his words from memory, “By these acts,” and what were these acts?</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.233" offset="10804328">These acts he said were that he had learned later, mind you these events occurred in 1952; he brought his complaints in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.279" offset="10836511">He said he discovered in 1954 that in 1952 Gulf and British Petroleum had conspired to bribe Cities Service with a contract to buy oil from Kuwait.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.442" offset="10909132">He said when you learn that, he said by these acts it joined the conspiracy, and then he went on to say it was thereafter rewarded for joining the conspiracy by being allowed to participate in a consortium which was established in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.619" offset="10973811">So when I proceeded to examine the plaintiff, and I would solicit your attention to that, I examined him precisely and I asked him this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.771" offset="11030444">Are you saying that except for these two events Kuwait and consortium, you have no fault to find Cities Service?</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.820" offset="11070673">He said that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.599" offset="11077778">I went further, I said would have made them defendants but for these two things?</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.234" offset="11096273">He said, I never would have made them defendants, and he had good reason for saying so, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.745" offset="11118320">Because Cities Service treated him with the utmost consideration although he was utterly unknown in the oil business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.802" offset="11146533">He testified that his only contact with the oil business was an occasional visit to the corner pump to buy 10 gallons of gas for his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.783" offset="11182477">Although he was a man who had never earned as much as $10,000 a year, he was trying to enter a multi-million dollar business, although he had never seen a tanker, he was looking for a fleet of several hundred tankers, you can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.646" offset="11246007">Nevertheless, Cities Service embraced him and with him went to Iran and they made a thorough investigation and when he got through and the whole thing blew up and nothing came of it, he came back and he said I spent some time and some money on this, won't you reimburse me and they reimbursed him, and he was very happy and their relations were of the most amicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.095" offset="11339734">But he later said that he discovered this Kuwait and consortium deal, he said that's why he named them as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.723" offset="11366275">Shall we examine him of that and having established, we then came into court with documentation of monumental magnitude to demonstrate that he was wrong about his basis of his belief, that the Kuwait contract had been started in 1948, had been negotiated, it was a very elaborate operation that involved the building of many tankers, it involved the building and assignment of a refinery and before Mr. Waldron had ever set foot in Cities Service office, the contract between Gulf and Cities Service for Gulf -- Kuwait oil had been fully approved, but only the signature remained open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.345" offset="11536802">That was our proof and we also demonstrated that as far as the consortium was concerned far from being invited into the consortium, Cities Service fought like a tiger to be given an opportunity to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.315" offset="11588629">It finally got a minuscule invitation of forty five hundredths of a percent, and they said we won't take it, it's too small to bother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.004" offset="11623424">So having demonstrated that we made our motion for summary judgment, almost there, but here was a man who says the only reason I made you a defendant is because I think you were bribed by Kuwait and rewarded by consortium, here is the proof that it isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.188" offset="11692074">Well our learned adversaries did their best to try to demolish what we did, but they failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.547" offset="11725511">So much so, that after that argument we never heard another word about Kuwait or consortium until we got here into this Court, as if this was a trial de novo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.794" offset="12718582">And if you read the opinion of the district court and the Court of Appeals you see that they too find that it was a misapprehension on our learned friend's part when he thought that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.173" offset="12760064">Indeed after September 25, Jones did a hundred different things to continue his interest in Iranian oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.922" offset="12791097">So much so that he went out and hired John W. Davis to write an opinion to establish the proposition that the British were wrong and that the Iranians were right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.638" offset="12845955">He kept that opinion and he sent it to the incoming Attorney General Mr. Brownell and to the incoming Secretary of State Mr. Dulles and he said this is what I believe the law to be, but he also said having been in the ramp they came to the conclusion that he can't overnight take a market which had existed in the eastern hemisphere and suddenly convert it and make it available for the western hemisphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.006" offset="12951385">He didn't know how to do that, and he says you can't take an industry of that size requiring 500 tankers to move and suddenly overnight build a fleet of that kind in order to shift that market into the western hemisphere and other reasons why it couldn't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.526" offset="13013452">He said why he couldn't operate the plant because it was built by the British and they are the only ones who control the replacement and repair parts for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.195" offset="13044172">Well there upon they said other things and just to briefly use up my few moments, we then submitted an affidavit and in which I listed every blessed fact that have been stated by the plaintiff and demonstrated to a QED but they didn't have an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.853" offset="13162768">Then it was under the pressure of that that Mr. Lane wrote in his brief what I quote on page, top of page of 54 and which appears at volume 2, page 460 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.929" offset="13239045">He said, “I don't claim -- plaintiff doesn't claim that Jones was acting on behalf of the conspiracy when he went to Iran, that was in August of 1952, or when he held his Tehran Conference, or when he wrote his conclusions to his draft report,” and that he says occurred on October 31, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.820" offset="13326608">So that we have Mr. Lane's admission in the most formal manner that you could present it in the court, that down to October 31, 1952, Jones had not yet joined the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.356" offset="13376763">Now my learned friend in his reply brief charges me, he says that I have read that language out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.900" offset="13399019">I suggest to you that if you read it, you will find that I did not read it out of context, but I'll go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.990" offset="13423365">I made that argument in the Court of Appeals and Mr. Lane was there and Mr. Lane never said that I spoke anything out of context with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.458" offset="13453249">He did not say I misunderstood him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.605" offset="13461817">This was an admission that down to that time there were no conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.800" offset="13482611">The next date of significance is 1955, that's the date when the consortium is put together, but we have it in this record that in 1954 the representative of Cities Service went down to Washington and pleaded and argued against the so called conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.602" offset="13569755">They told Herbert C. Hoover, then the Assistant or Under Secretary of State that the consortium idea was antithetical to non monopolistic practices in the oil industry and that it was a mistake to create it and that what they ought to do is open it wide open and they fought for that, certainly none anti-conspiratorial conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.580" offset="14157720">Indeed he said I should have perhaps stricken the complaint because once the basis for the allegation evaporated the plaintiff's lawyer really should have withdrawn his signature to the complaint under the Rule of 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.988" offset="14211323">But he said as a matter of policy not of logic he said so, I allow them to have some examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.188" offset="14244133">When he used the power under the 56(D) to interrogate counsel, counsel told him that he thought he was entitled to have an antitrust case based on suspicion alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.001" offset="14283421">He said he thought that's the way antitrust cases should be initiated on suspicion and he thought, that once he was able to utter the words, did Cities Service join the conspiracy, that was that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.830" offset="14390732">The facts are, the record shows that Sandberg a very large and substantial stockholder of Cities Service, a resident of Amsterdam was Jones' host on the way from New York to Iran, he stopped off in Amsterdam and did all on the way back and the following occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.209" offset="14464188">At the EBT, Examination Before Trial of Mr. Watson then the Chairman of the Board or the retired Chairman of the Board.</text>

Alton Jones, President and Director of Cities Service, the man for whom the invitation was obtained from Premier Mossadegh and who headed the team that went to Iran.</text>
