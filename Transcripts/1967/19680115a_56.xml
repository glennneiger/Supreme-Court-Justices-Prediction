            <text syncTime="558.134" offset="2335953">So your submission is that you don't challenge that proposition that that would be constitutional for a state or a city to say that no child, age 16 or less --under the age of 16 shall be permitted to attend any movies?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="576.861" offset="2410768">Right so.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.332" offset="2412648">As a matter of fact in New York Mr. Justice Fortas, there is such a statute and you must provide a matron before a child can go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.264" offset="2440443">And the theaters, this is purely a safety provision to provide such maintenance or they are not admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.833" offset="2462699">It is as if a book, if there's an ordinance or statute that a bookseller may not sell books on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.146" offset="2491956">If it were just all books on Sunday that would be legal, if he said it couldn't sell a certain book on Sunday, I think it would be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.596" offset="2525706">So that we must distinguish I think between all the ordinances and statutes which provide for the safety of children which is a desirable objective not infringing upon the free speech doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.322" offset="2576697">Now, the ordinance provided that all advertisements and a prominent poster must be put on the box office saying, “Not suitable for young person.”</text>
            <text syncTime="634.319" offset="2640645">And this Dallas board was created by an ordinance enacted by the Dallas City Council about two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.839" offset="2674709">And under this ordinance, it is a crime to show any motion picture in Dallas unless it has first been classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.975" offset="2707310">Now in the instant case Your Honors, United Artists which is the world distributor and also has financial interest in this picture, we might call it for practical purposes a producer to license the motion picture to the exhibitor, Interstate Circuit for exhibition at its esquire theater in Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.994" offset="2791320">As required by the ordinance, Interstate with the -- filed with the Board its proposed classification suitable for young persons as -- and provided also information on the description of the picture as it was required by the ordinance.</text>
