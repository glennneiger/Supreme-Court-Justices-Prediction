            <text syncTime="45.853" offset="286804">This action is before the Court by writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.204" offset="316165">The question before the Court is whether the principle of one man, one vote as established in Reynolds versus Sims applies to the governing body of Midland County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.406" offset="369037">We respectfully submit that the function of the County Government in Texas and the facts in this case suggest that the question be answered in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.861" offset="418774">Midland County, Texas is located in West Central Texas.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lyndon L. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="94.073" offset="479692">900 square miles, I'm sorry, Your Honor, 900 square miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.199" offset="500172">And it's governed by a governing body that's established by Article V, Section 18 of the Constitution of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.526" offset="533504">This provision of the Constitution provides that the governing body shall consist of a county commissioners court composed of a county judge and four county commissioners, each county commissioner to be elected from a commissioners precinct and to be elected for a term of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.615" offset="617827">The county commissioner's precincts are boundaries to the county commissioners precinct or established by the Commissioners Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.948" offset="651160">The original county commissioners precincts were established in 1885 and in the late 1800s and the early 1900s, there we're two or three minor changes made and no further changes were made in the boundaries of the county commissioners court until 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.048" offset="739558">Now in 1952, Mr. Hank Avery, the petitioner here and the plaintiff below, appeared before the county commissioners court of Midland County and pointed out to the Court at this time the disparity of population between the commissioner's precincts and the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.051" offset="819597">Mr. Avery pointed out that commissioner's precinct won of which he was a resident, contained over 95% of the population of Midland County and elected only one member to the Commissioners Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.095" offset="879783">That commissioners precincts numbers two, three, and four, contained less than 5% of the population of the county, and elected three members of the commissioners court.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.374" offset="932864">And therefore, he did not have -- the citizen did not have an equal voice in the Government, governing body of Midland County, and asked that county be redistributed in accordance with the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.848" offset="982810">His request was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.620" offset="993886">In 1963, Mr. Avery filed a lawsuit in Midland County, Texas against the Commissioners Court to require the entry to District Midland County in accordance with substantial numerical quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.199" offset="1068178">After this lawsuit was filed, the Commissioners Court held what they designate as public hearings in an attempt to resolve this issue and Mr. Avery appeared at these public hearings and presented a plan to the Commissioners Court whereby the county could be divided so that it would be equal in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.968" offset="1159293">Substantially equal insofar as miles of county roads, areas, taxable values, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.258" offset="1184371">The proposition of Mr. Avery was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.197" offset="1200149">The Commissioners Court made only very slight changes in the commissioners precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.209" offset="1224182">No substantial changes in an area or in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.224" offset="1244244">These changes were made in August 1963 effective January 1, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.276" offset="1280502">We filed an amended pleading after this action of the commissioners court and the case was tried in the spring of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.693" offset="1326164">Now, in the amended pleading, the amended pleading showed and proof substantiated in this case that Mr. Avery was a resident citizen of Precinct Number 1 of Midland County, a qualified voter and taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.371" offset="1388857">It further showed that the county, Midland County, were divided into four commissioners precincts numbered one, two, three, and four, and at each elected one member to the Commissioners Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.604" offset="1441834">The pleadings and the proof further showed that over 95% of the population of Midland County elected one member of the Commissioners Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.399" offset="1476942">And that precincts number two, three, and four, which contained less than 5% of the population of the county, elected three members to the Commissioners Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.712" offset="1518216">It further showed that county judge even though elected by the citizens throughout the county, and was a presiding officer voted only in the event of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.727" offset="1570252">The pleadings further set forth that this constituted invidious discrimination and denied to the petitioner here equal protection under the laws as guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment to United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.954" offset="1635140">The trial court in Midland found the above facts to be true and further found that the county knew this, the county governing body knew these facts to be true and if they could divide Midland County in accordance with population so that each commissioners precinct would have substantially the same number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.117" offset="1735868">Then the Court order -- the Court further found that its failure to do so constitute invidious discrimination, and ordered the County Commissioners Court of Midland County to redistrict Midland County in the commissioners precincts, so that each commissioners precinct would have substantially the same number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.619" offset="1821863">After this order was entered by the trial court, an appeal was taken to the Court of Civil -- by the respondents here in the appendix below to the Court of Civil Appeals at El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.910" offset="1867003">The Court of Civil Appeals at El Paso held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was not applicable to the governing body of Midland County and reversed and rendered the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.497" offset="1921337">We filed an application for a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Texas which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.123" offset="1947878">The Supreme Court of Texas reverse the Court of Civil Appeals and held that the action of the Commissioners Court of Midland County was arbitrary unreasonable and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.471" offset="1997302">It further held -- it further reversed the trial court in part and held that there was no invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.525" offset="2041501">It held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the United States Constitution was not applicable to the County Government of Midland County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.644" offset="2085909">The basis for this apparently was there was a variance between the condition of the people that live in rural areas and urban areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.341" offset="2244733">Supreme Court did not told if it was not applicable but said that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that the Midland County be divided equally insofar population is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.968" offset="2299277">The Supreme Court of Texas further held that this Court, the Supreme Court, did not have authority to redistrict Midland County that the trial court did not have authority to redistrict Midland County but that this authority was vested solely in the Commissioners Court and entered an order directing the trial court to enter an order based upon this judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.467" offset="2533230">Now, they held in that case that the Supreme Court of Texas be held that the rural residence of Midland County Texas had a different -- stood in a different place in the county government than the urban residence of Midland County Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2820.955" offset="11387173">Now, there are several significant facts that are firmly established in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.214" offset="11416221">One is that the governing body of Midland County is important in the lives of all of the citizens of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.482" offset="11449344">The governing body of Midland County performs legislative and administrative functions that daily affect the lives and welfare of all the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.220" offset="11492289">The governing body of Midland County is controlled by less than 5% of the people who elect three members to the governing body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.256" offset="11528443">There is no effective way for the voice of over 95% of the citizens of Midland County to be heard insofar as our county governing body is concerned since they can elect only one member to the Commissioners Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.590" offset="11589778">And we feel that this condition will remain unless it's changed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.973" offset="11615274">Now, it's the position of the petitioner here that each citizen of Midland County is entitled to an equal vote in the election of the county governing body.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.613" offset="11865840">In other words, isn't it conceivable, I suppose that the system deliberately designed so as to promote the development of the entire county even though the people within the city after subsidizing a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.532" offset="11953507">Just as the people of the United States, I suppose, people of New York State let's say do subsidize somewhat federal payments that go to the development of the -- of a less developed states and some of the sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.011" offset="12035427">Now, I suppose that this is -- could be said to be conscious policy and I guess the question which you are pointing out to us is whether constitutional principle requires that this system for the subsidization, if you wish, of the rural areas at the expense both voting and financial perhaps, the city wether that system, when the Constitution forbids that kind of system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.488" offset="12353285">In answer sir to that question, my statement would be that Article V, Section 18 the Texas Constitution provides that the commissioners precinct line shall be changed from time to time for the convenience of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.590" offset="12429772">It doesn't say rural people and it doesn't say urban people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.232" offset="12448266">I feel that the governing body of Midland County affects all of the people of county and it should be divided accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.523" offset="12493511">I would point out that apparently this same question was raised before the Court in Reynolds versus Sims that if the “one man, one vote” principle were applied and the voice of the rural area would be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.464" offset="12557249">The Court in that case provided that we are advised that states can rationally considers the facts other than population in apportioning legislation representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.968" offset="12603225">Our answer is this, a denial of the constitutionally protected rights demand judicial protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.464" offset="12633213">Our oath in our office require no less to the extent that the citizen's right to vote is the base, he is that much less a citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.480" offset="12889318">I suppose there's a little need to remind the Court that the issue involved here is the same one that was before the Court in four local government cases last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.996" offset="12935398">The Government participated amicus in those cases and we continue our participation here because we feel that the case involves the question that's of fundamental importance to our democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.705" offset="12998196">Essentially the question of ensuring fair and full participation at all levels of Government for all people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.910" offset="13039052">Initially and just in passing, I'd like to mention a jurisdictional issue that was raised at one point in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.358" offset="13072802">As we understand it, the respondents at the petition stage question whether there was a final judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.536" offset="13105507">We developed some pages in our brief to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.637" offset="13121912">We think that it's clear that the Texas Supreme Court's judgment was a final one both under Texas law and under this Court's precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.671" offset="13158066">And that therefore, the Court's certiorari jurisdiction was invoked, properly invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.557" offset="13177605">Now, it's clear that the Texas Supreme Court did remand case to the trial court but the remand was very limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.255" offset="13216371">It was for entry of a judgment in accordance with the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.519" offset="13233403">And we feel that it's also clear that the Texas Supreme Court did pass on the federal constitutional issue that was raised and then of course, is essential that this Court exercise of jurisdiction because the Texas Supreme Court stated and held that the Equal Protection Clause did not require population-based districting in Midland County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.967" offset="13339251">That was in the face of a trial court judgment which had ordered the commissioners to redistrict on a basis of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.808" offset="13374568">So, we think it's clear that this Court's jurisdiction is properly invoked and that there was a final judgment despite the limited remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="3633.300" offset="14636596">As I read this, the Texas Supreme Court has held, Number one, that -- that's in the first full paragraph on page 150, it is held that there is obvious arbitrariness of the current districting order because of the great malapportionment of the commissioners precincts in Midland County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.169" offset="14724054">And it's held that this is malapportioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3818.789" offset="15378578">We do point out that the body does have a general taxing authority overall the people in the county whether they live in the city or out in the rural areas, and that they have a power of equalizing tax assessment, determining what value is to be placed on property and that there is some indication in the record that this particular power has been used and certainly at least can be used in the future of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.783" offset="15494457">Should point out I think that the argument and the discussion this morning, I think, points out to our way of thinking the basic utility of pursuing some kind of distinction based upon whether the body is legislative or administrative or something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.674" offset="15582020">I just don't think that that's a meaningful way to pursue the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.496" offset="15605321">As a matter of constitutional law, we don't think that Reynolds versus Sims and the other cases were grounded on anything that was peculiar to State legislatures as distinguished from other kinds of representative bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.300" offset="15656521">Gray versus Sanders was mentioned this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.995" offset="15667388">That case didn't involve legislative officers and yet the Court applied the Equal Protection Clause there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.926" offset="15703124">For practical reasons, however, we think that the distinction is just an illusory one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.511" offset="15729455">What this kind of bodies and this is a typical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.594" offset="15745755">Some have more extensive powers, some have less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.969" offset="15759235">I suppose that -- and we mentioned that perhaps a de minimis rule could be evolved as to some of these bodies that they don't do important or significant things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.143" offset="15799986">And that they would be said not to be within the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.599" offset="15813778">But when a body has a general taxing authority over the people and it has a number of other important functions, the matter in which they're exercised and what kind of label or characterization might be placed on them whether legislative or administrative, or what, it seems to us to introduce into our courts and almost never ending inquiry as to how to do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.825" offset="15918686">What attributes do you focus upon?</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.829" offset="15934673">And finally, I'm not convinced that even if the judiciary spends the time in this inquiry, the results will be meaningful or coherent and of course, this Court will be in a position of trying to give some consistency and some coherence to these distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.206" offset="16012204">And therefore, we developed that greater length in our brief that we don't think a legislative administrative line distinction is a feasible one or a justifiable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.511" offset="16065390">One might say, “Well, let's just find out how the Board functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.374" offset="16084825">Does it enact to ordinances?</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.713" offset="16090258">And if it does then, that's a lawmaking kind of function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.331" offset="16104678">Why don't we say that's the test?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.348" offset="16116799">Well, we think that whether a body, the local level has a power to enact to ordinances or not, it depends so much on the vagaries of state law that you had -- if you focus on this, you would have attached to own that would not produce sensible or meaningful results.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.725" offset="16198301">And therefore, we feel that the power to enact ordinance is the form through which the body acts is not a -- should not be a determined one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.946" offset="16243127">We also should point out that in suggesting that a legislative, administrative line of distinction not be drawn as to the applicability of Reynolds at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.651" offset="16301955">We don't mean that all distinction should be cast aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.534" offset="16325465">It seems to us, first, that if some such line is going to be drawn, perhaps a better focus would be on whether the body is a policy making body or whether it is essentially is ministerial in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.607" offset="16381785">This is a line of distinction that has been worked out to some extent in some state as the municipal law matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.063" offset="16411669">We don't think that that would be -- that's much easier to apply but at least I think it might focus on the importance and the independence and whatever of the particular body.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.963" offset="16463182">We also suggest and develop at some length what we consider to be a significant and important consideration that stems from Reynolds versus Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.345" offset="16520756">And that is this, that Reynolds versus Sims assumes since it's grounded on the Equal Protection Clause and grounded on the protection of the individual's right to cast an equally weighted vote that all citizens are situated in a substantially similar way, insofar as their state legislature is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.631" offset="16613857">Now, this is a traditional except that Equal Protection Clause concept that classifications are valid if people are situated in a substantially different way but classifications are not valid if people are not and discrimination comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.349" offset="16688776">Now, we suggest that at least just to some so-called special districts and by this Act mean sewage and drainage and conservancy districts, bodies that in the main are set up to perform a single function and yet under the laws of some states are -- have a body that is elected by the people from districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.380" offset="16796923">That it may be that the Equal Protection Clause and Reynolds versus Sims do not require equal districting because the nature and the function of what this particular body does, does not relate generally to all of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.921" offset="16859094">It relates to this certain discrete identifiable classes of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.513" offset="16877380">Now, it may be difficult to apply this in some cases, we refer to in passing a couple of Arizona statutes that relates to drainage districts several.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.213" offset="16924191">They even point out there that the drainage district governing board is elected from districts but those districts are based on land area instead on people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.251" offset="16980407">But it seems to us that that may be a sensible line of distinction because the functions that those bodies apparently perform relate directly and specifically to only those people in their own land to be drained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.549" offset="17037563">It seems to us though that you can push this too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.661" offset="17053968">If the body nevertheless has a general taxing power and can affect importantly the lives of all the people in the area, then I don't think that we would carry this line of distinction and that before we but suggest then the people are basically situated in a similar way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.986" offset="17135365">This is a tough line of distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.592" offset="17141739">It seems to us that it's a pertinent consideration in deciding, how and when, and where, and why Reynolds versus Sims should be applied at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.954" offset="17195238">Now, this immediately raises the question and I think that it's fairly presented by the Texas Supreme Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.706" offset="17222196">Why shouldn't this apply to general function units, this line of distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.802" offset="17242572">You say that people are not similarly situated whether the rural and the urban people here are similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.418" offset="17277053">And our answer would be, yes, that they are in this situation would apply almost across the board to all general function units.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.785" offset="17314461">Here, we suggest they're similarly situated because this body does have powers and does exercise functions that affect all of them in an important way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.454" offset="17353226">It seems to us that the rather hoary motto “No Taxation without Representation” is not to be so likely cast aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.957" offset="17403173">If the body can tax these people and can use this money in ways that it sees fit, and it seems to me that those people wherever they live in the area, whether they live in the city or out in the rural areas, have an important and substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.408" offset="17472972">One might say, okay, they have an important and substantial interest but it is -- it is so important and so substantial that they have to be given equality in the weight of their vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.899" offset="17522918">Well, I don't think that that is unnecessary and indispensable constitutional requisite but as a practical matter, I don't think that it can be worked out in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.935" offset="17567117">Now, this sounds harsh but it seems to us at some states have adjusted to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.539" offset="17589478">Our own experience right across the river in Virginia indicates that independent cities can be created and established.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.724" offset="17622288">And in there, if the particular state feels that this problem that we refer to is overlapped in jurisdiction, it's a difficult one their ways available in the political and legislative process to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.909" offset="17695013">But, we think that it's quite clear that as to this kind of body whether you call it legislative or whatever, it does things that affect the people that live in Midland in an important way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.223" offset="17756244">Now, I'd like to discuss in passing at least some of the arguments that are made against defining Reynolds versus Sims at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.843" offset="17810787">Some people say states have a plenary power over local bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.532" offset="17825520">They can create them or do a way with them or do whatever they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.701" offset="17842134">Well, that's -- that's true but that doesn't carry today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.360" offset="17856763">All that we suggest here, is that whether the state creates local bodies whose members are to be elected from districts, those districts are required under the Equal Protection Clause to be substantially put in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.659" offset="17930010">Some people say they just so many of these bodies that the thing is unmanageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.463" offset="17957177">We pointed out that the Bureau of Census indicates there's somewhere in the neighborhood of 90,000 of these bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.262" offset="17988420">A recent publication, they put this out every five years, indicates that the number has been reduced to somewhere in the neighborhood of 80,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.849" offset="18018722">As you've pointed out, that almost all of the reduction indeed more than the difference in the reduction is in consolidated school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.054" offset="18051636">We suggested last term that is insofar as the principle, we suggest to be applied that it would affect somewhere in the neighborhood of 20,000 of these bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.323" offset="18100642">We think, however, that while there are a large number of these, the principle is manageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.139" offset="18119973">The Court is not writing on a blank sheet here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.304" offset="18128541">We pointed out and discussed at length that seven state courts of last resort have already applied the population principle to local bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.267" offset="18168456">And this includes states like New York and California, the two largest states in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.364" offset="18204818">These states of this State Court of last resort have found that these are full and practicable to handle this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.804" offset="18234598">Indeed in one of the cases, the Wisconsin case, there was a State statute that was involved and the Wisconsin Supreme Court pointed out that its decision would have of course affect in one stroke all of the counties in the state rather than to have litigation as to each and everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.504" offset="18309413">Now, we feel that for the reasons developed more fully and what we refer to this is our Sailors brief of last term that the matter is a manageable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.840" offset="18350686">We think that this is confirmed by this Court's decisions in Bianchi and Moody cases last term which the Court held that three-judge courts would not be required in the federal system in most of these situations since the involved statutes of limited applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.614" offset="18433860">We also note that the Court in the opinions written last term express to concern with innovation and experimentation at the local level and of the state for interfering with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.900" offset="18494986">We think that is well-advised if we don't think that the rule of applying Reynolds at the local level will do a way with innovation and experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.106" offset="18535842">Most of these malapportioned situations have not come about through experimentation or innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.929" offset="18563114">They've come about through a resistance to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.681" offset="18578056">The trial court here pointed out that and made a finding that the purpose behind this scheme was political expediency to maintain the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.078" offset="18615672">That was true in the state cases and that's true at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.643" offset="18629987">And we think that it would be a rather plural irony of experimentation and innovation were used to uphold the schemes on the hope that someday this would develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.133" offset="18687875">We think also that it's quite clear that the Court hasn't resolved the question presented here and yet, we keep running into Tedesco and cases like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.703" offset="18726222">We've explained in our brief the limited significance in our view of pre-Baker decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.279" offset="18760495">We also pointed out that the several per curiam decisions not on the merits involving local government are certainly not controlling either otherwise a lot of us would have been wasting a lot of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.002" offset="18815352">Last term's decisions it seems to me deserve comment but to it we handle on jurisdictional grounds, we think that has absolutely no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.826" offset="18862686">The other two cases Sailors and Dusch, the Virginia Beach case, you indicate that in the particular and peculiar circumstances involved there, the Court didn't feel that the Equal Protection Clause apply to require equally populated districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.210" offset="18948263">But in Sailors, the Court pointed out that there wasn't even elective scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.136" offset="18971878">The Court focused on the system for determining County School Board members and said that that was in an appointive system and also pointed out that at least to non-legislative offices such an appointive system was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.355" offset="19040841">But here we have an election system, so no question can be raised about that decision controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.720" offset="19066232">Also in the Virginia Beach case, we had a large election scheme, here we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.363" offset="19088802">We have an election from districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.184" offset="19096116">I think it's clear also that whatever else might be said about the Virginia Beach decision, we pointed out at some length our concern for that decision being applied sweepingly and across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.486" offset="19149302">But whatever might be said about it, it doesn't have any bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.036" offset="19179499">I'd like, in conclusion, to refer just in passing to what we consider apart from a legal argument some policy considerations that are quite important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.450" offset="19237177">We, of course, don't need to be told that this is a time of crisis in our governmental institution as the demands on government have never been as great and this includes the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.021" offset="19291408">And it seems to us if our society, our system, is to meet the demands or urbanization and population growth, we need responsive and viable local instruments of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.259" offset="19344384">Now, it's also clear that malapportionment impairs the effectiveness of the bodies to operate in a responsive way and to a deal with the problems and the needs of the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.778" offset="19390464">We think that this is particularly so as to local bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.735" offset="19402271">They touch and involve people in the most direct way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.644" offset="19413974">For many people they are the government because they deal with those problems that people are most concerned about, local taxation and zoning, and the condemnation, and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.343" offset="19460786">And we think it's also quite clear that if malapportionment at the local level continues, some of the bright promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 might well be deemed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.449" offset="19509164">Therefore, in our view, these policy considerations combine with what we feel to be logical and sound constitutional principles to argue in favor of applying the equal population principle of Reynolds at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.755" offset="19582412">We submit, therefore, that since Texas Supreme Court under our reading of its opinion rejected the application of the equal population principle that its decision was wrong, and therefore, ought to be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5068.151" offset="20376012">This case has in it certain drawn issues, narrow issues, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.745" offset="20410389">This involves Midland County Texas and the question as to what Midland County can be subdivided as directed by the Texas Supreme Court without considering solely equal population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.349" offset="20484786">This case is not what might be called a one man, one vote case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.181" offset="20508087">In fact, Your Honors, we do not find one man, one vote as a rule of Reynolds versus Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.629" offset="20537866">We tried to say that the rule of Reynolds versus Sims is what is said by this Court in the Dusch versus Davis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.003" offset="20571408">When this Court said on the assumption that Reynolds versus Sims controls the constitutional test under the Equal Protection Clause is whether there has been invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.743" offset="20630340">We believe that the question here is and first to be decided is whether the Court has jurisdiction, possibly that has been decided finally against respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.233" offset="20684257">In any event, it is a question because this case has been sent back to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.021" offset="20707453">In Texas, that's a District Court and the Commissioners Court for division of this county without discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.883" offset="20742875">The Texas Supreme Court has said that under the United States Constitution and the Texas Constitution, there cannot be division of the counties in a discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.189" offset="20788120">That is invidious discrimination or as we read the opinions the vision without reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.530" offset="20817481">The Texas Supreme Court has followed what we believe is the law and ordered a remand of the course for division of the county into four precincts; population and other factors, in other words, division with population in mind and without discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="5267.738" offset="21174314">We believe that's the first question for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.895" offset="21186957">I don't want to dissect the question because the question here is, “Does this Supreme Court of the United States wish to say “We will not permit this matter to be decided by the Texas courts on the basis outlined by the Texas Supreme Court?”</text>

            <text syncTime="6950.684" offset="27906069">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6957.307" offset="27932609">We would consider ourselves remiss and our duties as counsel here, if we failed to call the Court's attention to two things, the causal relationship or connection between them being for the Court to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6975.388" offset="28004916">One is that in the way the American System of Government is structured.</text>
            <text syncTime="6984.262" offset="28040443">There is a special relationship between the states and a county such as Midland County which is a political subdivision of and a creature of the state and its legislature or other municipal corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.353" offset="28116825">The other is that the United States Constitution is applied differently to local governmental subdivisions and municipal corporations than to individuals or private corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7026.342" offset="28208776">Now, I make those two statements as a matter of fact as to what the structure of the United States Government is and as to what this Court in past opinions has held.</text>
            <text syncTime="7043.016" offset="28275440">It has been recognized by this Court from its earliest history that governmental subdivisions and municipal corporations are creatures of and agents of the state, created by it for the purpose of carrying out and effectuating its law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7063.491" offset="28357360">There are administrative agencies or enforcement agencies they have been created by the states for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="7072.343" offset="28392782">The states which create these governmental subdivisions and within the other local governmental agencies have power over them which is virtually complete and except, and unless, and until of course, such power is exercised in a way as to run counter to some plainly written and established federal constitutional prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7106.430" offset="28529142">Specifically, a government -- a state would have the power and its will or wish or whim to abolish a municipal corporation or a county, or to divide it into two or to consolidate and merge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7123.409" offset="28597060">But certainly under the decisions of this Court, a state could not exercise that power in such a way as to leave its creditors high and dry because that would run counter to and bring the states actually in conflict with the Contract Clause, likewise as in the case of Gomillion versus Lightfoot, which is cited with some degree of relish by petitioner in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7150.961" offset="28707192">Admittedly, a state may not exercise this control which it has over its municipal corporations and its governmental subdivisions, in such a way as to run counter two the Fifteenth Amendment and bring in about a discrimination in voting based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="7173.146" offset="28796008">But subject to those specific constitutional restraints, the states have plenary power over their municipal corporation and likewise over the officials who served those corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7188.591" offset="28857762">There are decisions which we have cited in this brief to the effect that the states have the power in the federal system to provide such officers and officials as they may choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="7201.136" offset="28907917">To confer on these officers and officials, such power as the state chooses to give them or to take that power away to provide that they may be selected by appointment or by election, or by combination of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="7218.873" offset="28978866">Or the states have power to abolish these officers all together.</text>
