            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="18.358" offset="176776">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.489" offset="189315">Yesterday in the course of the Marchetti argument, someone asked Mr. Zeldes whether he regarded the Firearms Act as involving the same considerations as to wagering taxes and I was interested in that question because it's necessary for me to endeavor to persuade you that they're both unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.225" offset="280221">I do think they involve somewhat different arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.326" offset="304671">The statutory schemes are totally dissimilar and as a result, I think, the considerations for the Court here are rather different from those involved in Marchetti and Grosso.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.654" offset="362036">Indeed, as the party has developed the issues in their briefs, it would seem that really all that is involved here is a question of statutory construction because we are not fundamentally in disagreement on the constitutional issue except for its ubiquity use restriction argument, the Government concedes that if we have construed 5841, 5851 correctly that result is incriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.916" offset="479065">It takes issue with our reading of those two sections of these very complicated and poorly drafted statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.796" offset="518562">I would like to go first to the second of the questions discussed by the United States and assume for the moment as every court, every lower court that has passed on the question has held that the requirement of registration in 5841 is itself unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.621" offset="593899">I'd personally come back to argue that rather than simply to assume that at a later point.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.072" offset="619708">If that is so, can you, as again the lower courts have held, nevertheless prosecute a person for possession of a firearm that has not been registered?</text>
            <text syncTime="141.590" offset="669759">Here in petitioner's view that the answer is reasonably clear and the answer is one, apparently and importantly as statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.003" offset="707375">The United States reads 5851 as meaning that you can be prosecuted for possession of an unregistered firearm only if it is not been registered at anytime by any person so that if some prior possessor has registered it, they say that the present possessor is under no duty to register and therefore we're -- we aren't incriminating him or when we prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.907" offset="806954">This seems to me an extremely difficult reading of the statute to take in the light especially of the Treasury Regulation No. 179120, that requires registration unless it is registered to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.266" offset="892426">It doesn't say that it's enough that it has been registered to somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.197" offset="904129">It says he has to register unless it is registered to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.603" offset="917817">And here, I think, the registration faithfully carries out the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.259" offset="940387">The provisions about 5841 seem to look to the present possessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.976" offset="963271">They -- the first section -- sentence of 5841 says that every possessor has to register, but then the exception in the second sentence, you're not required to register with respect to a firearm which such a person acquired by transfer, importation or which such person made if the provisions of the chapter applied and if the provisions required thereto were complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.622" offset="1057834">The focus here is on the possessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.524" offset="1065462">He is the "such person" to whom the statute is referring and it is talking about his acquisition by transfer or his making.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.626" offset="1109870">The -- it seems to -- in view of the petitioner that the United States has no support in the cases except the very recent ones that have drawn these torts distinction for the proposition that prior registration by somebody else dispenses with the requirement that the present possessor register.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.520" offset="1193462">Professor Wright, I have a -- and I had a difficulty with your argument in this respect perhaps because I don't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.535" offset="1229511">Let me put a simple proposition to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.199" offset="1248214">Let's assume that the law says that it is a crime to drive an automobile in the District of Columbia with an expired license plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.765" offset="1294399">Let's assume that the -- after March 31, 1967 I drove my automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.249" offset="1336404">Now is it your position that thereafter, the -- I could not be compelled to buy a license or a new license for my automobile because that would incriminate me on account if I had possession of the automobile and drove it after a license had expired which is a crime.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="329.172" stopTime="337.725">
            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="329.172" offset="1420100">I don't understand, Mr. Justice Fortas how buying a new license would be an admission that you had driven the car at the time when your old license had expired.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="337.725" stopTime="350.299">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="337.725" offset="1454268">Well, under this -- under the Firearms Act, all you're saying as I understand it, when you register as I am now in possession of the firearm, is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="350.299" stopTime="351.596">
            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="350.299" offset="1504528">Yes, that's right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="351.596" stopTime="364.196">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="351.596" offset="1509752">Just as when I buy a new automobile license, what I'm saying is that I'm in possession of an automobile and I intend to drive it on the streets of the District of Columbia.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="364.196" stopTime="364.277">

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="364.277" offset="1560430">But that's where I have -- had a difficulty in understanding what I believe is the -- your basic argument, that is to say that if I register a firearm and say that I now possess the firearm, what respect does that imply that I have been in possession of it unlawfully here before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.686" offset="1678085">You have to have it in order to possess it, in order to apply for a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.769" offset="1698461">That's point one.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.727" offset="1706297">And point two, even if there might be some admission that for a moment of time or a month of time or a year of time I had it in my hot hands without having registered it, does that relieve me of the need to license it?</text>
            <text syncTime="423.378" offset="1796890">A man has to have it for sometime before he can apply for a license I assume.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="431.120" offset="1827819">I suggest, Mr. Justice Fortas, that a closer analogy would be if you had a local statute providing that everyone who has stolen a car shall be required to buy a licensed plate for it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="444.847" offset="1882781">Well, but mine, I -- with great respect, it seems to me to come closer to the statutory pattern of the National Firearms Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="452.221" stopTime="483.918">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="452.221" offset="1912247">That's exactly the point of difference, I -- you'd have to show me a little more clearly than I now see it that that is in fact the pattern in the Firearms Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.579" offset="1973687">Firearms Act does not as I see it say that you must register only those firearms which are in your possession unlawfully by a theft or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.919" offset="2031052">It doesn't say that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="483.918" stopTime="501.981">
            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="483.918" offset="2038993">I think, fairly read, it does with one minor exception because it says that if you acquire this lawful, if the transfer provisions of the law were complied with when it was transferred to you or if you made it and you complied with the making provisions of the law, then you do not have to register.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="501.981" stopTime="577.837">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="501.981" offset="2111300">And you're saying, because of the negative implication or the negative effect of that that the law has to be read as if it meant that you register only if it's in your possession unlawfully that is to say that previous owners have not register yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.286" offset="2204505">But I'm afraid that there are two, I sort of fall off the back in your bicycle which is rare because the difficulty is that it may be in my possession because of by reason of a gift, by reason of purchase, by some lawful reason and I'm totally ignorant as to whether it has or has not been registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.722" offset="2310248">That may not be an uncommon occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.943" offset="2323101">And certainly, I think you also have to look not only at what may possibly be the circumstances, and affected by the statute but the statutory scheme and intent, the -- in fact dramatic effect of the proposal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="577.837" stopTime="606.877">

            <text syncTime="577.837" offset="2414738">Oh, I'm glad if I could pull you back on my bicycle by endeavoring to analyze the statutory scheme as I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.197" offset="2456116">It seems to me, Mr. Justice Fortas, that if you acquire this firearm that we are talking about by gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.972" offset="2491225">You are then required to register under 5841 unless the transfer provisions were complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.939" offset="2519124">If they were complied with, you don't have to register.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="625.462" offset="2605223">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.312" offset="2616613">But if these provisions have not been complied with, when the gun was given to Justice Fortas, then he is guilty of two crimes: First, if he doesn't register it, he has failed to register under 5841 and possesses an unregistered firearm contoured to the ban of 5851; and second, he is also the possessor of a firearm that has been transferred without the transfer provisions being complied with so that he could be prosecuted quite apart from the registration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.241" offset="2744299">This, it seems to me, is the fundamental vice of the portion of the Firearms Act that we are attacking and our attack here is a very limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.114" offset="2779826">It goes only to the registration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.480" offset="2793305">The vice of it is that it is so unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.907" offset="2806993">Indeed, it's only purpose seems to be to provide a means for a multiple sentences for a single transaction because in any instance in which a person may be prosecuted for possession of unregistered firearm, he may also be prosecuted for possession of a firearm which has been made or transferred without complying with the making or transfer provisions so that here, we are asking people to come forward and accuse themselves of crime to no good purpose.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1610.994" offset="6547310">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.418" offset="6573014">I think the last formulation that Professor Wright used perhaps best summarizes his claim of what the statute means and did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.215" offset="6624214">He said, I think, that we were sending Mr. Haynes to jail for non-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.638" offset="6653889">I assume he means by that for Mr. Haynes non-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.145" offset="6679907">And I think Professor Wright agrees that to reach that conclusion, both statutory sections, 5841 and 5851 have to be construed his way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.859" offset="6738840">Now, I first like to turn if I may to 5851, which is the provision under which Mr. Haynes was prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.376" offset="6780844">That's a statute that defines as a crime, possessing a firearm under certain situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.961" offset="6819192">One of those situations, and I'd like to read the exact language, "Is to possess any firearm which has not been registered as required by Section 5841."</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.537" offset="6881468">Now, our position is that that in no way deals with the defendant's failure to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.566" offset="6913651">It is in the past tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.968" offset="6919293">It said -- says, Has not been registered?.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.327" offset="6936639">It's quite in contrast to another section, Section 5855.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.308" offset="6960567">It does deal with the possessor's failure to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.586" offset="6981674">In Section 5855, it makes a prohibition on shipping firearms and interstate commerce in certain situations and the first clause of that says, "It shall be unlawful for any person who is required to register as provided in Section 5841 and who shall not have so registered to ship in interstate commerce".</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.299" offset="7092537">Now, we believe that the language, a quite different language of Section 5855, help show that Congress had a rather different idea in mind in the past tense that it used in Section 5851.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.289" offset="7148544">I'd also like to point out, if I may that if Professor Wright's reading of Section 5851 were correct, then this language, which Congress put into the statute in 1958 would simply duplicate the requirements of Section 5841 which require possessors to register and the failure to make that registration is punished under the penalty section of the statute, Section 5861 by the same penalty as it would apply to a violation of the possession placed in past tense in Section 5851.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.103" offset="7327744">And the last point I'd like to make on the meaning of this part of Section 5851 is that as I understand Professor Wright's argument, he refers to -- he relies on two words, Such person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.049" offset="7403604">Now those words don't appear in 5851 as near as I can tell in any context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.431" offset="7437145">My understanding is that they are taken out of 5841 and what the meaning of those words in 5841 as I see the statute has -- provides no help in interpreting the possession provisions in the past tense in Section 5851.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.152" offset="7520005">Now, I think it's fair that there are two points to Professor Wright's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.946" offset="7547173">One that I just dealt with is that the charge against the defendant is that he himself failed to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.894" offset="7586983">Now, as I've indicated, we think that's wrong as a matter of statutory construction and for that reason alone, the conviction ought to be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.180" offset="7628048">But there's a second essential element to the petitioner's argument and that is that under Section 5841, the registration requirement, the only people who have to register are those who already violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.675" offset="7698056">As cast in the District Court and through the briefing in this case, the attack on the statute was a simple attack on its face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.132" offset="7751868">As we understand that to mean, it is that in the petitioner's view, there is no situation to which the statute can apply without resulting in the incrimination of the register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.329" offset="7816652">Now, in the argument, I think Professor Wright has said, he agrees there are some rare, I think rare was his word, cases in which registration would be required without incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.723" offset="7878301">I would think to start with that alone is enough to defeat his argument that the statute is unconstitutional on its face but more importantly, in terms of what the statute means, in our view, it is those rare cases that he describes that the statute was particularly intended to apply them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.491" offset="7985298">As I think Mr. Justice White's suggested earlier, the scheme of this statute is to require advance registrations or at least notifications to the Treasury of changes in possession of the firearms, these machine guns and sawed-off shotguns that are subject to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.207" offset="8072234">There are two situations generally in which the provisions of the statute will result in this type of advance notification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.124" offset="8115911">One is when there is a taxable transfer and in these situations, the transferor has an obligation to obtain information about the transferee, to fill on a form, to send it to the Treasury to put the tax stamp on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.885" offset="8190934">In a taxable making, now that is a taxable making is when it is made by somebody who was not a manufacturer, who was not paying the manufacturers occupational tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.361" offset="8244851">The person who is making it is required to file in advance a declaration of his intent to make; that is in Section 5821 (e).</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.789" offset="12950549">Now, these two, I would suggest is somewhat similar to the pawnbroker statute.</text>
