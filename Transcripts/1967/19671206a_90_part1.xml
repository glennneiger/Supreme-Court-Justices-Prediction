            <label>Mr. Bruce R. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="97.644" offset="493902">Historically, the Commission had determined rates on utility rate base, cost to service method.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.062" offset="523577">Inherent in this method is a clear foreseeable relationship as to any particular service to be rendered for each utility entity and the cost of rendering that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.099" offset="579793">A certain number of dollars will provide a service for which a certain rate must be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.363" offset="604871">This is the heart of utility regulation and this system has worked very well in the utility industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.621" offset="629844">When this Court held that the Natural Gas Act applied to the producers of natural gas, spokesman for this industry vehemently urged that this industry was no count whatever to a public utility and that a utility method of regulation could not successfully be applied in the producing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.760" offset="714376">The Commission staff urged rejection of this pleads.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.131" offset="727855">After all, it was expert in utility regulation that knew they were they method.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.119" offset="747813">This ideological battle weighs for seven years while the producers thought cost to service regulation and urged the method of regulation based upon the consideration of the economic characteristics of and the economic factors that work in the producing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.528" offset="825448">Producers argued first that the cost of gas cannot be determined like the cost of public utility service with little joint cause but for gas in a joint product with oil and with natural gas liquids the best that could be done was to estimate the cost of gas using some cost in formula in flowing wholly arbitrary allocation method that allocates the joint cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.720" offset="934222">In no real sense could the cost of gas actually be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.109" offset="951777">The producers argued second that the Commission owed a duty to induce an adequate continuing supply of gas for the interstate consumer and that even if the cost of gas could be determined, a cost determined rate could not perform the function of a listening supply due to the lack of relationship between expenditures and results.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.064" offset="1051669">The forcibility, the dollars of input, the output and the rate that would provide an adequate return so characteristic in the utilities was absent in the producer industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.166" offset="1107989">Nonetheless, during these seven years, the utility rate based cost of service method was employed by the Commission while each side shamelessly computed cost to service studies designed to yield a desired cost result.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.039" offset="1179564">It was readily apparent that the joint cost constituted such a large percentage of the total cost that any desired cost result could be obtained and was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.647" offset="1229928">Finally, the Commission recognized what foolishness this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.209" offset="1252185">Concurrently with the second Phillips opinion, the Commission issued a statement of general policy in which it announced it was abandoning individual regulation in favor of regulation of an area and a group basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.738" offset="1314356">For as reasons stated in the second Phillips that in the experience of the Commission and I've hoped has shown beyond any doubt that the traditional original cost, prudent investment rate base method of regulating utilities is not a sensible or even a workable method of fixing the rates of independent producers of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.385" offset="1408920">Producers of natural gas cannot by any stretch of the imagination be properly classified as traditional public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.503" offset="1445386">Their result finally reached may give the illusion of accuracy since mathematical processes are involved and a definite prize for Mcf is the final result.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.931" offset="1495124">But such a result must be tested against the realities of the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.735" offset="1514350">Thus, prices calculated solely on the cost rate base principle cannot be accepted if they are higher than a buyer pay or lower than the seller will accept when an unrealistic result is reached, they formulate for allocations must be changed in order to bring about a reasonable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.540" offset="1593553">The allocation method has then become a means of supporting a result already arrived at rather than a means on arriving at a result which was previously unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.422" offset="1637021">From the foregoing, it follows that effective regulation of the price of natural gas must be on some more manageable plan than the rate base method.”</text>

            <text syncTime="906.257" offset="3728384">Mr. Justice Jackson, with rare foresight, foretold the dilemma which must result in an effort to regulate the producing industry as a public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.289" offset="3772479">In FPC versus Hope, 320 U.S. 591, he -- it was perceived, the fundamental difference between the utility business of providing an inexhaustible service and the finding, developing and producing of irreplaceable gas at an unknown cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.916" offset="3851055">The consequence of the relationship between inputs and outputs, sole characteristic in the utilities and so absent in the producing industry was clear to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.923" offset="3903091">He said the service was to be measured by what was got out of the ground not by what was put in the ground and that there was no more relation between investment and result in a game of poker.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.190" offset="3948126">He thought it easier to directly determine the fair market value of gas than to indulge in a round about way of rate based price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.306" offset="3988564">A year later, in Colorado Interstate versus FPC, 324 U.S. 581, Mr. Justice Jackson was in even more prophetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.147" offset="4027956">There he indicated he had not buy the end result test as to catch all solution to all problems nor the necessary correlative velocity that they -- and justifies the means.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.263" offset="4080410">This was especially true where as in the rate of -- natural gas rate making the use of rate based figures was a little better than to draw figures from a hat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.332" offset="4124714">He bemoaned his lack of intuitive knowledge by which he may determine -- may decide that a rate so determined was just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.952" offset="4167137">In that case, he laid down the foundation of what became the regulatory method advocated by the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.331" offset="4196707">He said and I quote, “Foresight of gas rate regulation will concern itself for the present and future rather than with the past as the rate base formula does.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.506" offset="4241429">It will take account of conditions and trends at the source of the supply being regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.941" offset="4263163">It was used price as a tool to bring goods to market, to obtain for the public service that needed amount of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.765" offset="4294405">Once the price is reached, that will do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.623" offset="4305899">There is no legal or economic reason to go higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.929" offset="4319065">On the other hand, if the supply is not too (Inaudible) and the price is not a sufficient incentive to exploit it and fails to bring forth the quality needed, the price is unwisely low even if it does square perfectly with somebody's idea of return on a rate base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.545" offset="4389595">Before going into the supply consequences of the present regulatory method, I will quickly enumerate the reasons why rate based regulation they produced in the industry is arbitrary, discriminatory and unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.657" offset="4437974">One, the cost of gas as distinguished from the cost of the utility service cannot be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.481" offset="4465246">Two, a rate fixed at any estimated cost can perform the economic function of a listening supply only as the consequence of accident, such there's no relationship between cost incurred and supply added.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.721" offset="4518222">Three, if a cost determined interstate rate is less than or equal to a free market determined in cost state rate available gas supply will tend to move to the intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.759" offset="4566392">Four, cost based rates are not amenable to the judicial review to its participants in a producer area rate proceeding are entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.427" offset="4605053">The Tenth Circuit said and I quote, “In arriving at the Permian Basin rates, the Commission used many sources of cost information that producers attacked these sources on many invalid grounds to take up each of these objections would increase the rate of this opinion to encyclopedic dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.571" offset="4677674">From the information so obtained, the parties, the staff, and the Commission made many competitions and reached many results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.172" offset="4704110">The assumptions, allocations, formula, equations, averages, means, and massive calculations they intrigue a mathematician or a statistician but they have no attraction for us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.340" offset="4780701">We cannot in a few months unravel as null of statistics developed in the years of hearings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.719" offset="4810271">A regulatory method which is too massive and too complicated to permit appellate review can hardly be deemed a valid method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.267" offset="4852485">And the end result test fails because the only thing against which the end result may be tested is the untested cost result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.081" offset="4891669">Five, cost to service discourages exploration because it uses past calls to set future rates without any adjustment contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.347" offset="4928763">Sixth, in periods of declining explorations such as over the past 10 years, successive cost to service studies will use successively lower cost results which in turn will inspire further reduced exploratory expend -- investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.682" offset="4994069">While each of these studies well appeared to provide the industry with the return, it is in fact liquidating in the day of gas shortage and gas ration and is being advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.222" offset="5040253">Seven, cost to service estimated area by area will discriminate against those consumers who draw their supplies from high cost areas and discriminate in favor of those consumers withdraw their supplies from low cost areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.965" offset="5103261">Eight, the cost of gas has no relation to the commodity value of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.956" offset="5127189">To those members of the Court who may have a copy of my brief before them, I respectfully direct your attention to page 29 where all appears a most illuminating table.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.890" offset="5174941">This table plainly tells us that under the empathies of Commission regulation, we are slowly running out of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.184" offset="5204093">However high, the Commission is to be graded, for providing the consumer with low rates for gas, it is lacking in providing the consumer with an adequate continuing supply of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.852" offset="5262817">Column B shows the plunge in successful exploratory drilling for the years 1960 to 1966 from 868 in the former years steadily down to 578 in the latter year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.037" offset="5335542">While in absolute figures, the total reserves in Column C show us nine increase, increase is nowhere near as great as to increase in actual demand showing in Column E with the attendant continuous decline in the proportion of reserves to production so in Column G.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.839" offset="5422686">I wish I could tell this Court at 1967 would reverse this trends but I cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.496" offset="5445360">In 1967, successful exploratory well is drilled, will be down to only 445 if the percentage decline for the first nine months of 1967 compared to the first nine months of 1966 continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.639" offset="5505964">Actual demand will be up to 18.4 trillion cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.634" offset="5533863">The reserve to production ratio will be down to only 15.7 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.405" offset="5556955">This is practically down to the 15.5 to 1 which was the lowest figure that any party to these proceedings ever suggested it was safe to allow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.499" offset="8105357">We first contend that the State of Texas presented evidence in this case before the Commission of the hearing examiner, the Commission rejected it on account of the holding in the Hope case and the Circuit Court of Den -- in Denver, Colorado upheld that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.715" offset="8198248">There's only one little paragraph in the decision that we disagree with and that's what we're actually here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.344" offset="8224789">As you know the Hope case was decided in 1944, some 10 years before this Court held that the producer came under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.774" offset="8270451">We are -- appeal that we do not -- that that decision does not control as it now, the Act is now come into be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.290" offset="8308485">It was one pipeline, do you remember out of West Virginia and one producer -- or not producer, one distributor there or the consumers rather, and the Court in that case found that I would just -- it was a small of matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.900" offset="8370970">West Virginia was trying to argue that they wanted to keep the price of gas up in order to protect coal and all that have an effect on the economy of the State of West Virginia and the Court rejected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.264" offset="8424469">But we don't have that thing here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.065" offset="8439620">The Court said in that case, in the Hope case that the results to West Virginia were -- in our -- I believe I quoted right, it was indirect and it was insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.516" offset="8489462">Now we have in Texas and New Mexico, since we're arguing this jointly, a tremendous area out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.458" offset="8525197">We have 4,700,000 acres of land in this basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.173" offset="8548080">I believe New Mexico has around 3 million acres in the basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.621" offset="8565844">Now this 4,700,000, the greatest majority of the fact in all of it is state owned land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.425" offset="8593115">The state owns the minerals under this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.148" offset="8603982">They're producing -- the producers here made contract with landowner which -- acting as agent for the state are the state in most cases lately have been leasing the land themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.557" offset="8653615">We have grown up tremendous cities and an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.845" offset="8670751">If you've been there, is not in the world but (Inaudible) less than 3 to 4 inches of the land a year not suited (Inaudible) there's no irrigation water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.099" offset="8707741">The ranching is all it can do outside of producing oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.147" offset="8719966">It built up a tremendous economy in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.242" offset="8732296">And we undertook before the examiner and to show the Commission that the production of oil and the production of gas had a tremendous impact on the economy of our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.527" offset="8785481">Now we're not just talking about -- the one I'm talking about the Hope case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.341" offset="8796766">I'm not just talking about this particular case because as it was indicated yesterday they have hearings under way in which will cover -- blanket our entire estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.243" offset="8840338">I don't know of any -- (Inaudible) left out I'm sure that they have tried to get (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.968" offset="8855280">But those -- will have the last case, I believe the catchall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.713" offset="8866252">And I won't -- I want the Court to understand that we don't have a one plea here this morning that's all we're after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.170" offset="8888090">All we're interested in is that the State of Texas be allowed to present its evidence as to the effect that the Commission order might have on the state and its economy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Crawford C. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="2244.051" offset="9079620">Sir, we offered a proof of -- on the conservation of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.725" offset="9102294">Our Railroad Commissioner Mr. Murray at the time testified as to how this would work with that and the other was offered by Mr. Stockton who was with the University of Texas and he offered testimony concerning that if the production of gas, exploration of gas is discontinued that this economy with million and millions of dollar would completely collapse, so there's nothing else to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.155" offset="9191946">That was frankly offered but the Court decided the Hope case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.648" offset="9205948">What I want to try to tell you, (Inaudible) of the Hope case, in my opinion, there's no -- no longer apply to the facts or at least to -- as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.444" offset="9265194">Now New Mexico they'd say, they have 3 million acres and about 45% of their education comes out of that particular basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.517" offset="9313468">Now we feel that the Commission failed in the statutory responsibility to the public to protect the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.088" offset="9371773">What is the public interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.429" offset="9371669">That is -- that's the question that was -- that is the question that I could -- that we have here in front of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.198" offset="9384208">I think the public interest includes a tremendous wide field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.285" offset="9400508">Is not -- and I think the Commission has taken that in view and we're a little bit alarmed if they didn't allow the full range and look at that testimony because we feel that the public interest includes all the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.313" offset="9456619">And this is a constitutional question that we've mentioned in here about this place being only for footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.331" offset="9484727">I know it's very easy to say, "Well, you're producing state and therefore you shouldn't have anything to do with it".</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.659" offset="9506043">As long as it is only cost basis, as long as it is strictly on a cost basis, I would probably agree with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.208" offset="9532165">I don't disagree with the Hope case and original finding but I certainly disagree with it when you change it from and it seems that that's the direction the Commission is going at, when you're changing it from a cost basis over to other -- bringing other factors particular to explore for new gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.930" offset="9603114">Then you would certainly bring in and Mr. Witt will cover that point adequately, the conservation of oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.684" offset="9638118">As I have stated, they have done a tremendous job and the Railroad Commission has -- we feel likely conserving oil and gas and the compact was renewed I believe only this -- here today for two more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.296" offset="9688586">I wanted to state to the Court as my opinion, the Commission and the Court completely were in error and not lying this evidence in because of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.354" offset="9752743">There are two ways of looking at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.375" offset="9760893">You can say well, that you're going to have -- just look at the consumer in the matter and I believe it's indicated by the arguments here yesterday that the consumer in this case, but we told it about it is a small consumer, that's what the State of California preceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.559" offset="9825573">I say that there are two ways of looking at it and the way we like this Court to look at our end of it, there are high quantities and there are low quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.451" offset="9877191">As far as I'm concerned, I believed that the consumer in California and I have nothing against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.401" offset="9896939">And I want to say that if the state is allowed in here, it may be the time come and it probably will come soon that we might be just as interested in the lower price of gas than we were in the higher price of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.210" offset="9960260">But the low consumer in California, I mean the low quantity as I see it in California, is testified here at least stated in the Court yesterday was around $6 to $8 at the most, maybe $10 per person out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.904" offset="10018983">I slipped into the meddling of this area, El Paso, the person out there has a high quantity because he has a tremendous interest in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.148" offset="10067989">Millions of dollars invested that each person draws a salary out of that and I certainly don't stand here in front of the Court to say that you should support something in order just to keep few people off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.946" offset="10107173">What we feel like that the Court should look at this and should allow us by all means to come in and present our evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.633" offset="10133922">If the Court doesn't -- if the Commission doesn't want to give us any consideration, we -- I would say, but we think it should be allowed to present it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.653" offset="10169971">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.417" offset="10213021">My name is Boston Witt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.872" offset="10218872">I'm the Attorney General of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.476" offset="10225246">I appear here on behalf of New Mexico in opposition to the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.344" offset="10252727">Now, the Court please I could stand here during my allotted time and commiserate about how much tax money this decision will cost New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.774" offset="10286477">But it seems to me there is a far more important question at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.617" offset="10309883">Far more important than any tax lost to New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.803" offset="10326601">Even more important than any profit, to any company involved in this case and in my judgment more important than the price of gas to the consumers in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.905" offset="10371009">It seems to me that the more important question is, what will be the day when the consumers of California will it -- be able to buy gas, be unable to buy gas from the Permian Basin at any price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.131" offset="10419911">The question then of course is conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.894" offset="10434957">Now, we have to remember that in the discussion yesterday, it was pointed out that two-thirds of all gas produced in the Permian Basin is casinghead gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.290" offset="10476544">That is to say gas produced in conjunction with oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.849" offset="10494725">Casinghead gas is somewhat different form a gas-well gas, and that it must be produced at the same time that the oil is produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.433" offset="10537148">When you produce the oil, you must by necessity produce the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.993" offset="10555329">At that point, two things can be done with the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.242" offset="10568391">One, it can be marketed if the cost involved in gathering it and bringing it up to pipeline standards are -- the price is sufficient to justify the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.222" offset="10612276">Or two, it can be vented to the atmosphere and flared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.518" offset="10629413">Now New Mexico in the 1930s, along with Texas were the leaders in the conservation measures in the hydrocarbon field.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.467" offset="10689285">New Mexico and Texas led the nation in conservation of hydrocarbon energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.414" offset="10709034">In the early 1930s, we passed a statute empowering our Oil Conservation Commission to prohibit the flaring of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.481" offset="10741321">Now we permitted them to flare gas for some period of time for the simple fact that it was uneconomical to gather at that point because the price was insufficient to justify the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.417" offset="10789073">But almost two decades ago, New Mexico has prohibited producers from flaring casinghead gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.341" offset="10824704">We have -- we did so, because at that point, the price became economic enough that we could force them to market and gather it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.681" offset="10858141">Now this is in contradistinction of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.183" offset="10872142">California had great and vast reserves of hydrocarbon energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.680" offset="10890115">And today, they are barren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.951" offset="10899205">And I must say that California appeared before you yesterday as a consumer state as it must because its hydrocarbon energy now has been wasted, it has perhaps lead the nation in lack of conservation practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.687" offset="10962108">So what appears before this Court today, or yesterday, and ask this Court to put its stamp of approval on a decision of this -- of the Federal Power Commission which will be the seed which might well destroy New Mexico's conservation practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.067" offset="13087640">The Superior Oil Company is a large nonintegrated producer of oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.923" offset="13115016">We have no refining operations, no retail marketing of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.658" offset="13134033">We do not engage in the federal chemical business, on the plastics business, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.295" offset="13160573">Our operations are limited exclusively to exploring far and producing that oil and gas which is sold generally in the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.819" offset="13206653">Because of the limited nature of our operations, relatively more allow a capital is expanded annually for exploration, than that of most other companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.132" offset="13271855">More than that perhaps in the integrated company, because necessarily their budgets must include their exploration function and accommodate to the other aspects of their business which are vary in their needs from year to year, more than the so-called small producers, merely because of our size.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.797" offset="13358582">Our operations are identical with that of the so-called small producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.140" offset="13383973">Because of the fact that we need to drill more wells and deep wells, we are what is known as a high cost company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.173" offset="13420022">We do not gold plate our wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.622" offset="13433814">Dr. Warren (ph), a witness for the Commission, explained in -- explaining why there was a variation in annual cost of the various companies for drilling and exploration, that primarily it results from what he call the well mix, the well mix being the type of well and the depth of well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.140" offset="13519914">And he said these are the factors that lead to add cost, not extractions, not improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.762" offset="13546454">He did point out that there was a great range in cost from here to here between the various companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.650" offset="13565994">But he did not point out and it is not true, that a high cost operator who continues to do the same thing won't continue doing a high cost operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.492" offset="13609357">It's just inherent in the nature of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.551" offset="13621582">As I say, there are some changes in some of the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.798" offset="13638614">Now, the argument has been made that even though they don't get their money back this year, next year they're the low cost companies can get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.754" offset="13674350">That argument to me runs right into the phase of regulatory rules that future rates will not be made to compensate the past losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.540" offset="13721579">Now I would assume that present rates will not be fixed to compensate for potential savings which may or may not ever develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.336" offset="13764733">But this fact explains why superior takes the position that we do, that group rate fixing is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.924" offset="13811022">The fact is that high cost companies get the benefit of the reduced rate that results from average whereas the low cost companies get a part of their cost, a part of the high company cost which go into their averages and permit the computation of a rate of return for them on figures which are in fact actually higher than their cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.673" offset="14094085">I would say basically so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.948" offset="14103176">I think this, if I must put myself in a nutshell, I'd say my position is that the Hope decision is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.698" offset="14138180">Now, as I say I am going to address myself primarily to the issue of legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.764" offset="14162422">And the basis of (Inaudible) is that the natural gas itself at work, requires individual rate fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.254" offset="14200351">Furthermore the decisions of this Court, the intent of Congress in passing the Act as this Court has described it, the Natural Gas Pipeline Case, the Hope Case and the Colorado Interstate case, I think leads a no conclusion other than that individual rate fixing is absolutely required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.417" offset="14293034">Furthermore, I would like to show that if the Natural Gas Act does not provide for the establishment of individual just and reasonable rate, then the Act doesn't have any standard of regulation whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.279" offset="14356459">It is with that question then, I believe, an unlawful, unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.180" offset="14400136">Because then, they are legislating rates and they have no standard whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.832" offset="14418735">Now the Act was passed in 1938, and as the court below found, all of its wording goes to the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.516" offset="14457396">Now, the general counsel for the Commission told you a particular attention to Section 4 and I'd like to do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.438" offset="14489161">He urged going here, that any rate has to be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.174" offset="14512044">I will look at the same Section because it says all rates of any natural gas company must be just and reasonable and if they're not, they're unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.700" offset="14558124">This was the rate standard under which the Natural Gas Act was held constitutional in natural gas pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.164" offset="14591979">There, with reference to the just and reasonable rate and the lowest reasonable rate permitted under Section 5, the Court said, by long standing usage in the field of rate regulation, a just and reasonable rate or the lowest reasonable rate is one which is not confiscatory in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.072" offset="14675675">The constitutional sense itself is an individual consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.653" offset="14698036">It applies to a person or a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.984" offset="14715277">Now I admit it that the constitution doesn't find rate fixing or agencies to the use of a single formula, but the leeway to choose a formula for fixing has absolutely nothing with meeting the standard of rate fixing which again is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.388" offset="14792913">Now this was the precise holding as I understand the Hope Natural Gas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.735" offset="14814333">There, they said that at the end result is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.324" offset="14832619">It doesn't make much difference how they got that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.818" offset="14842650">They can use any formula they choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.016" offset="14855398">And they said to be just and reasonable the rate must be one that will produce revenue sufficient to cover the operating cost and the capital cost of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.091" offset="14903777">It must be rates which from the investor or a company point, will lead capital cost the ability to pay interest on debt, pay dividends, to have sufficient return to measure what the risk in several enterprises to maintain confidence in the financial integrity of the business, to permit that business, to maintain its credit and attract more capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.554" offset="15029582">The obtaining and maintaining of credit, the payment of dividends, the attraction of capital, even the payment of operating expenses are all individual company obligations and abilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.910" offset="15079006">The industry does not have these capabilities, it does not have these obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.450" offset="15105128">Since you cannot comply, the Hope case to the industry as such, then it seems to me you are in the position where there is no standard whatsoever under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.904" offset="15151000">Now, there cannot be any question as to the fact that Hope did in fact require individualized rate fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.783" offset="15194467">The very option was suggested in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson, there he pointed out that because and incidentally these are the same reasons now put forth for the group rate method, because of the erratic nature and the peculiar characteristic of this business, the erratic nature between investment and results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.185" offset="15296136">That it was improper to use any sort of cost of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.454" offset="15309197">Incidentally, I do not insist on the cost of service, that doesn't have to be the method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.587" offset="15333752">But -- then he said what he would like to do, is to fix the price of gas on some sort of a commodity, a basis that didn't assure a fair return to any producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.942" offset="15391117">In his own words, his views were rejected by the majority of the Court because Congress in passing the Natural Gas Act intended to and did provide for regulation along recognized in more or less standardized matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.408" offset="15461021">They then -- conceivable to me that the individual rate fixing requirement opposed in 1944 is not equally applicable today even though it may be inconvenient with the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.529" offset="15525491">Certainly, since 1938 when this Act was passed, neither the purpose nor the intent of Congress has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.557" offset="15561644">Furthermore, it's rather unbelievable to me that a rate fixing agency would propose a matter which by design is going to provide far in the words or the court below of bankruptcy rate for a high percentage of the industry and less than a fair rate for 50% of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4087.045" offset="16451584">No sir, it doesn't take into account the oil revenue and for the very simple reason that oil isn't regulated, but we have made allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.688" offset="16482095">Now of course in this particular case they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.028" offset="16491499">They used -- they determined cost for gas-well gas for the reason that they said there are fewer allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.288" offset="16524518">The -- someone has pointed out, you still have 55% of the total cost is an allocated cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.145" offset="16555969">But be that as it might they could -- they imputed that cost over to the associated gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.546" offset="16589511">Now as I say, this ratemaking method, by design is going to result in a high percentage of the companies going out of business or being required to go out of business every time there's a successive hearing because obviously if the high cost -- the highest cost producers here are eliminated, the next time you got a low rated average and so you are going to eliminate those and pretty soon you're going to get down to where there are no others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.322" offset="16704658">Then that effect of it -- it seems to me it's totally contrary to general national policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4180.823" offset="16826702">Prohibited to flare gas for the sole production of -- sole purpose of producing oil that maybe I think pointed out some exceptional circumstances where economics will not permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.960" offset="16871215">Now unless we have this economics imposed on us, we've been able to -- forward to gather it and sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.157" offset="16907995">Now I would point out too, the Natural Gas Act certainly does not require a uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.203" offset="16932133">A uniform price is alien to the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.831" offset="16950732">It hasn't even been a matter that the purchasers have embarked upon their prices in the same field at the same time are generally are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.314" offset="17000678">But between purchasers, there's always been a difference in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.117" offset="17019800">There is in a situation here that have been pointed to where they say, but you can't make money anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.683" offset="17042056">The fact to the matter is that we've been getting along very well at our contract rates and the contract rates, high, low or otherwise have been rates that the public not only could afford but found sufficiently interesting to increase their demand for the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.772" offset="17122408">I certainly can assure you that if you can eliminate any high percentage of the 50% of the companies who will not make a just and reasonable rate in their gas production, there is an absolute shortage tomorrow if that's when it becomes effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.077" offset="17191685">Now, I would also call to you -- to the Court's attention that in Justice Jackson's dissent in Hope, he recognized that in this situation if the party who's rate was -- did not yield a fair return, wanted to get out of the business and was compelled by some other reasons to stay in, then the Court -- he was suggesting would not meet constitutional requirements and that's exactly what's happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.904" offset="17295026">Now, what I wanted to say a moment ago was that there can be absolutely no question as to the effect of the holding in Hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.688" offset="17326164">And for that, I would call to the Court's attention, the decision in Bowles versus Willingham which involved a wartime federal rent control statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.212" offset="17372244">That opinion written less than 90 days after Hope, again, by Mr. Justice Douglas speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court, pointed out that there was a distinction between this rent control line and the Natural Gas Act because Congress in passing the Natural Gas Act provided the fixing a rates which are just and reasonable in their application to particular companies or particular parties and he cited Hope of course with that to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.971" offset="17511215">Now then, if we assume, which I don't, that Hope is not governing here and I do not see how group rate fixing can be established without overruling Hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.141" offset="17567953">And I certainly do not think that second Phillips did that because second Phillips relied in fact on Hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.744" offset="17598360">Second Phillips says, "First, we're not going to render advisory opinions, which of course is nothing new in history of this Court, and they didn't".</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.780" offset="17642454">But they did say this, they said, "We can't -- now determine that the method employed will necessarily result in a rate which is not just to the consumer and not just and reasonable to the producer, a rate to which they each have a right".</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.615" offset="17717791">That's that right I am here insisting upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.773" offset="17730435">Now, if the Act doesn't provide for group rate fixing and certainly I think everybody concedes it does not provide for it and the question is does it prohibit?</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.481" offset="17777246">Then if it doesn't, then by what standard must the composition of groups be determined by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.649" offset="17821968">The Act provides none.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.828" offset="17830640">Now obviously if the Federal Power Commission can pick any group it chooses, then by the very constitution of the group itself you foreclose and foreordain what the average rate will be and what appears to be a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.206" offset="17892185">Now if the answer of it that -- well it doesn't say one way or another so obviously the implication is that they may create reasonable groups, then if that'd be the case in this particular proceeding we have all been deprived the due process of law for the reason of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.986" offset="17959267">With the institution of the proceeding here, the Commission also provided in the very same law that they would not entertain objections or a contention to the effect that the group fixed was not sufficient for rate making purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.840" offset="18030738">And we have been deprived of that and therefore as I say we have been deprived of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.821" offset="18050696">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="4500.458" offset="18105240">My name is Robert W. Henderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.943" offset="18115166">I represent Hunt Oil Company and several other independent producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.461" offset="18137213">We are petitioners in Number 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.343" offset="18152782">It is not our position before this Court that group area ratemaking per se is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.592" offset="18185697">It is our position that the application of the method by the Commission in this case is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.900" offset="18218924">First, it violates the individual constitutional rights of the independent producer by lowering their revenues below the cost incurred by those producers without taking into consideration, the cost incurring factors of the gas itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.285" offset="18304502">The second reason that the method used by the Commission in this case is unlawful is because it does not provide for a just and reasonable rate for the group nor for the individual oil and gas producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.463" offset="18369181">Because it fails to provide for the lowest possible reasonable rate, it is inconsistent with the maintenance of adequate service in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.349" offset="18424769">First I would like to point out some pertinent facts which should be considered by this Commission in determining whether or not the method applied by the Commission violates the constitution or the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.563" offset="18525602">That is reference should be made to the exhibits in the record which appear at 519E, 520E which is basically the Exhibit 174 prepared by the staff witness Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.664" offset="18594043">It shows the individual cost of the producers whose cost reduced by the Commission in arriving at the average.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.830" offset="18634689">Of course that exhibit uses a 9.5% rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.852" offset="18654751">So therefore for the exhibit to actually be comparable with what the Commission determined in Opinion 468, the return component of that exhibit would have to be raised from 9.5% to 12%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.003" offset="18703339">Basically that is what we have done in the Appendix 1 to our brief where we have taken the individual cost of the 44 producers, raised the rate of return from 9.5% to 12% and have shown exactly what the individual cost of the companies would be and this is what it showed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4737.819" offset="19054634">Among the 44 producers there is a wide dispersion of cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="4748.030" offset="19095489">That appendix shows of the per unit cost was as low as 5 cents per Mcf and it all further shows the 16 producers of the 44 had cost below the 14.5 some average, and that 28 of the producers had cost above 14.5 set price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.304" offset="19176573">Of the 28 producers who had cost above the 14.5 cents, well, had cost between 14.5 to 20 cents.</text>

            <text syncTime="4782.718" offset="19234252">If you would take an average of the cost of the producers who have cost below the 14.5, their cost would average 12.6 cents.</text>

            <text syncTime="4806.255" offset="19328397">The Commission attempts to leave the impression that cost above the average is extravagant or wasteful cost and cites to Acker versus U.S., 298 U.S. 426 for the proposition that regulatory agencies should not allow such cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.686" offset="19398092">We do not contend that extravagant or wasteful cost should be allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4830.944" offset="19427140">Acker versus U.S. should be cited for the proposition that the method used by the Commission in this case is inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4865.187" offset="19564126">In this case, the Commission has not considered any fact other than the average cost of a select group of companies representing only 16% of the gas in the average.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.623" offset="19609893">No consideration has been given to the size, volume or other cost incurring factors which are inherent in the gas itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.219" offset="19648240">The Commission in this case has not made any findings to the effect that the cost incurred by the producers were extravagant or wasteful.</text>

            <text syncTime="4904.044" offset="19719502">This inclusion should by implication stand for the proposition that the cost so included was not extravagant or wasteful.</text>

            <text syncTime="5518.932" offset="22179088">The record shows in this proceeding that in the 1960 test year, in the Permian Basin area when you are considering only gas-well gas, two fields in that entire Permian Basin area accounted for 52.5% of the gas, 13 fields accounted for 17 -- excuse me, 76% of it, 24% of the gas-well gas in 1960 produced in the Permian Basin came from 358 (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.570" offset="22301654">However, there is no record -- evidence as to whether the cost used by the Commission relating to the group of 44 producers came entirely from the two field or whether it came from the 13 fields or whether there was a dispersion among the other 358 fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.418" offset="22373021">It cannot be disputed that you have two reservoirs and the cost of each reservoir is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="5783.696" offset="23238196">My clients have the somewhat dubious distinction of offering the largest single reduction of any firm certificated price in the Permian Basin area as a result of the area rates prescribed by the Commission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.391" offset="23304965">During the time allotted me for oral argument, I would like to focus your attention on the failure of the Commission to include any amount in its cost base area rate to compensate producers such as my client for a substantial out-of-pocket cost incurred in rendering, gathering and treading services which are of demonstrable value to the consumer in which if performed by a pipeline would admittedly be included in the pipeline's cost of service to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.728" offset="23450311">If my time permits, perhaps after lunch, I would also like to briefly comment on a procedural due process question concerning the quality standard set by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.767" offset="23502451">From the consumer standpoint, the natural gas business is divided into four basic functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5856.810" offset="23530663">First, the gas must be found and produced at the well bed, then it must be gathered for many different wells, might I say this gathering function is necessary whether it's oil-well gas, whether it's gas-well gas, whether it's new gas, whether it's old gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5876.308" offset="23608613">In some instances, the gas contains impurities and must be cleaned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.145" offset="23627943">In other instances, the pressure of the gas is too low and it must be compressed before it can be delivered to the interstate pipeline companies which transport at long distances to distribution companies which in turn sell it to the housewives and to the other consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.377" offset="23708923">Now each of these functions must be performed if gas is to be made available to the consumer at the burned tip.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.310" offset="23744658">It is undisputed that the area rates in this case were fixed on the basis of the Commission's computation of the cost of gas at the wellhead that is before gathering, before any treading.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.127" offset="23811845">We don't challenge any of those false computations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.414" offset="23828982">What we do challenge is that the Commission admittedly did not determine or make any allowance to compensate producers such as my clients for the cost they incurred performing services beyond the wellhead.</text>

            <text syncTime="5965.528" offset="23965445">But as I understand his position, he says that if they bring the gas up to the quality standard, they're compensated because they get the ceiling price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.822" offset="24006614">I think that the answer to that is threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.406" offset="24021034">First, I want to make it very clear to the Court that no processing or treading cost were included anywhere in the cost computations used by the Commission in determining its area rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5990.366" offset="24064815">I think secondly, the argument of the Commission ignores the fact that these processing and treading services actually exceed the minimum standards prescribed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.234" offset="24116328">In other words, my client for instance, they compressed the gas 20% more than the Commission would require and yet they get no compensation for that, no compensation for the extra cost that they incur to doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6015.764" offset="24166379">And of course, the Commission's quality standard by bringing it up to the quality standard has nothing to do with gathering whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.169" offset="24208071">If the gas is delivered at the wellhead the area price applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.631" offset="24225938">If it's gathered over many, many miles and many, many thousands of acres, the price is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.057" offset="24251643">Oh, I think that that's the answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.114" offset="24263868">What we really challenge here is that the Commission admittedly did not determine or make any allowance for such cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.293" offset="24292498">We submit that in fixing area rates the Commission simply cannot regard -- disregard actual legitimate cost of gathering and treading gas after it was produced but before it is delivered to pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6060.991" offset="24347355">This cost benefit the consumer and some allocated portion should have been allowed by the Commission in fixing just and reasonable rates in the Permian Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.164" offset="24392077">Such gathering and treading cost actually involves millions and millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.828" offset="24410676">For example, my clients alone own and operate the equivalent of 253 miles of 3-inch pipeline that connect and gather gas from hundreds of wells over many thousands of acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="6091.015" offset="24467414">We have installed over 24,000 horsepower compression to compress the gas to the pressure required by the pipeline, which I have just stated is actually 20% higher than the Commission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.334" offset="24516733">Our investment in this gathering in the compression plant is our equipment is -- in excess of $13.8 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.659" offset="24554036">Of course the total investment of the other producers in the Permian Basin rendering similar services is much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.731" offset="24590294">There is no question that if these services had been performed by pipelines, they would have been included in the pipelines cost of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6130.160" offset="24624044">This Court had so held on many different occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.277" offset="24640449">It follows that when producers such as my client provide identical services, they too should be compensated for their cost.</text>
