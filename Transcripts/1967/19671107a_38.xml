            <label>Mr. Irwin L. Langbein</label>
            <text syncTime="24.741" offset="202376">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.953" offset="223169">This is corporate reorganization case arising under Chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.175" offset="248038">It comes here from the Fifth Circuit and originated in the Southern District of Florida where the company under reorganization has its home port and principal office.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.349" offset="300805">It's in the business of supplying ocean shipping service of a specialized nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.277" offset="328495">It falls well or highway rather trailers overseas, the maritime equivalent of railroad fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.013" offset="379382">The petitioner Protective Committee consists of a small group of small stockholders who hold authorizations from like stockholders, but they have attempted throughout 10 years in three reorganization plans involved here to discharge their responsibility to the whole group of public stockholders and not insofar as the record shows to over 7000 stockholders who hold over one million eight hundred thousand shares of stock which was sold to them in an original flotation or a series of flotations of stock of this company at prices up to $4.5 and $5 a share in a rig market for the most part in violation of the 1933 Securities Act, so far as registration is concerned and also in violation of various fraud provisions that would be applicable under both of 1933 and 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.907" offset="658996">The protective committee seeks to set aside this plan of reorganization, the third as I said which excluded the stockholders from participation in the reorganized company.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.840" offset="714689">They say that this reorganization is a rehearsal of the classic pattern of the reorganization scandals of generation ago that resulted in Chapter 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.729" offset="774248">Scattered innocent security holders are excluded from the reorganization which has been dominated we say by the people who wreck the old company and notwithstanding charges of mismanagement and fraud against them, they come out either with priorities or with control of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.930" offset="883127">We served as Brown's proportion not a long Trail Court errors of law particularly in the area of Valuation Law and Securities Law but that there is a pervading failure on the part of both courts below to hold the trustee who in Chapter 10 is the key to a fair and honest reorganization to the performance of the statutory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.517" offset="1005484">We say that he performed belated and inadequate investigations particularly of charges of fraud against the people who ran the company and come out on top.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.087" offset="1067760">We say that he made some errors of securities law which Mr. Ferber for the SEC proposed to discuss a little bit later, but we say that basically what was wrong was that both courts refused to hold the trustee to his duties of investigation, particularly of frauds of disclosure, particularly of compromises with people charged with fraud and in one instance established so far as the trustee himself is concerned by an investigation which he had made, which came up for the demonstration of fraud to his satisfaction on the basis of which he recommended for example that under the Taylor Triborough Doctrine those people should go to the bottom of the reorganization, but they came out on top.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.760" offset="1266395">And we say that he failed to disclose the basis of his comprises with and after they had been charged with fraud which had never been recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.696" offset="1314147">He failed to bring into the record various facts which are of importance on valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.973" offset="1343300">He fudged we say, some of the valuation facts which were in the record and most important of all he failed in his basic duty for which the statute imposed upon him of independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.910" offset="1411009">He had a fiduciary duty under the statute to stay it on the length with all the people in the reorganization and instead he entered into alliances with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.697" offset="1466180">For example the largest single creditor whose case I shall discuss in a moment turned up on the Board of Directors with him and he himself on the Board of Directors, a fact which the SEC proposes to argue as having special significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.176" offset="1560116">And we say that he had a duty to accept no favors at the hands of the people with whom he was required to deal and with whom he made these compromises.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.645" offset="1625945">We say he violated these -- his duty by accepting his position as President of the new company at the hands of people charged with fraud and also at the hands of people who were discount claim buyers who were interested in patronage and they too sit on the Board with him now.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.362" offset="1724792">Sir, this is the third time that the case has been up to the Court of Appeals and one of our complaints here, the reason that we presented the case under the supervisory power rather than just under conflicts is that we felt that the Court of Appeals has a share of the responsibility for happened here that on the first two appeals, on the first one we raised some of these points that we are now raising, on the second appeal we raised all of them, passed them off, didn't issue advisory guidance on these points, dismissed them as moot and thereby encouraged the court below to encourage the trustee it his dereliction of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.258" offset="1912456">And on the third one its plain from the opinion and the court said this case has been here nine years, as a matter of discretion we might just well let it go that the Court of Appeals is pretty well bored with it and never looked into it and this is why we brought it here as a matter of the supervisory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.364" offset="1996779">In the first appeal it was our position and it was dismissed as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.479" offset="2025305">The second appeal and it was combined with another appeal in which the main question of setting aside the first plan for fraud was brought up on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.122" offset="2083819">The second appeal, we didn't bring certiorari although the government on a collateral point that is collateral presentation did.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.204" offset="2116211">The third time around we brought certiorari because only then was it then squarely presented.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irwin L. Langbein</label>
            <text syncTime="555.360" offset="2324773">Now, what I think illustrates what happened here and what we complain now first is the treatment of the claim of Merrill-Stevens Dry-dock and Repair Company, which is the shipyard that had the largest single creditor claim in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.885" offset="2414947">Merrill-Stevens claimed amount of about $1,600,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.639" offset="2441906">Most of it was for conversation work on the company's self propelled vessel called the Carib Queen.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.322" offset="2484642">What immediately provoked the reorganization was the fact that the Carib Queen on her maiden voyage to France had a boiler blowup and this crippled the Queen and the crippled the company and led to reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.363" offset="2560815">Of course the validity of that claim just as a matter of a commercial claim was a better subject of dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.498" offset="2597386">When a boiler blows up and a vessel is put out of commission, so that the company has to limp along after that has it did during the reorganization with barges only, there is a lot of serious problem involved and this was at first disposed off by the trustee notwithstanding there was evidence that it was not alone the Queen that it had been subject to shoddy workmanship, but another vessel had capsized after having been designed by Merrill-Stevens, still another vessel had been put out of the shipyard with some defect in discharge line, which of course at the swamp and sink and there were all of these shall we say commercial defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.822" offset="2798634">The trustee recommended payment in full, after an off the record of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.227" offset="2828309">The Security and Exchange Commission made its own investigation, purely on the question of what I might call a commercial claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.353" offset="2864776">He came to the conclusion that there were defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.947" offset="2883166">They weren't perfect, but they should either be litigated out for if an appropriate settlement whose dimension that commission wasn't prepared the state within the week it should be settled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.629" offset="2933844">We the committee were dissatisfied with that, just as we had been dissatisfied with some earlier refusals of the trustee to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.717" offset="2970206">We obtained leave from the court to investigate and we made a further investigation, as a result of which we turned out charges and we outlined the evidence of fraud by Merrill-Stevens, its largest creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.621" offset="3037811">The essence of the fraud, the details I have to skim over consisted of participation in a fraud by other people in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.923" offset="3083055">The other people in the case are a group headed by a man named Abrams, a notorious stock swindler who was in Federal prison at the time of this reorganization, although not convicted of any matters involved in this company, a representative of a respectable security house, a man named Shaffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.872" offset="3214817">The trustee in a belated investigation that wasted three years of this reorganization, the one that resulted in the first certiorari that Mr. Justice Harlan asked me about, had found that Abrams and Shaffer had wrecked this company, that there had been in the pre-reorganization stage a large number of sales of securities, most of them in violation of the Securities Act and fraudulent by virtue of the techniques that I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.206" offset="3380224">And furthermore he had found notwithstanding denials by M/s. Shaffer and Spitzer and some of the people associated with them, that Shaffer and Spitzer who came into reorganization posing as innocent mortgagee title holders, actually knew that the beneficial interest in the mortgage that they have and which wound up with the priority were to a large extent owned by Shaffer and by Abrams, Directors of the records of the company but this was hidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.597" offset="3529749">And this was the crime -- this was the matter that it had led to this first plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.660" offset="3553991">The trustee refused to accept leads that we had offered him showing the connection and it wasn't until three years later as a result of an independent investigation by the SEC followed by a thorough so far as it went investigation on 167, the statute section that provides for formal investigation, full investigation that these things were discovered and at that time the trustee recommended that Shaffer's Spitzer should go to the bottom of the heap, that there should be suits pressed against them against the individuals behind them that there should be.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irwin L. Langbein</label>
            <text syncTime="936.720" offset="3850219">Sure, he recommended the assertion of both sets of claims, the company claim against these people, the stockholder claim against these people and also he recommended that there should be an offset against this innocent appearing mortgage which was on the most crucial assets that the company had and which had been put by these people who wrecked the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.546" offset="3973517">On these assets, on the eve of bankruptcy for the option to turn them all, again the stock that everything went well and with the stranglehold in case everything worked out to nothing as look to be the case at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.532" offset="4065468">Now, essentially what I have said a the Shaffer Spitzer group and it's first reorganization plan was a digression because my interest in it is to point out to the Court that there were charges of fraud against this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.251" offset="4140387">And that they had been established by the trustee on the record in the result of an investigation although belatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.864" offset="4174869">And we have said also in this further investigation that we had made that the Merrill-Stevens group allied themselves with this, stop pushing in this fraud because they too had connive with management and with the people who are dominating management and it's financial matters to commit a fraud upon the maritime administration and upon the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.692" offset="4294092">Again without going into the detail of it because it has never been investigated in fact there happens not to be a formal denial of it on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.471" offset="4349262">A portion of the stock portion was achieved in this case by representation as to a maritime commission guarantee on the construction mortgage of the Carib Queen in her reconversion of the company's use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.130" offset="4423868">The mortgage had been guaranteed by the maritime commission, which made a statutory finding which was much advertised by the stock pushers that the enterprise was economically sound and that guarantee could not have issued nor that representation had been made use of in the sales or not for fraud practices upon the maritime administration by a mortgaging out procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.077" offset="4539643">The statue under which the maritime administration operates initially in these loan guarantees requires that a certain fraction of the cost to be paid in cash, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.147" offset="4587917">Although it was paid in cash, there was a hidden under-the-table deal whereby the cash would return right back to the company in exchange for company stock at an arbitrary price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.210" offset="4640162">The company was at the time putting stock down on the markets who, the hands of its friends and people who controlled it for all sorts of prices and for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.844" offset="4682794">So this was way in which we said that there had been a fraud on the part of this major creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.443" offset="4721142">Now with respect to both these creditors the mortgagee group and the trustee had found guilty of fraud and the shipyard when we had alleged in detail although there had been no formal investigation was guilty of fraud nothing happened so far as the trustee was concerned by way of action on that fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.451" offset="4833155">Indeed at one point in support of our charges of fraud against Merrill-Stevens we attempted to bring into the record by ordinary discovery procedures, motion to produce and so on some documents bearing on it which we described after we located them that the trustee said he didn't know anything about it, he hadn't found them and the trustee opposed our attempt to obtain them by ordinary discovery procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.275" offset="8604505">I should like to first discuss the question of the trustee succeeding himself as the President of the reorganized company. Chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act provides that the choice of the person to head up the reorganized corporation must be “Consistent with public policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.737" offset="8702307">This is Section 221 of the Act which we quote on page four of our brief, if I may just read the applicable provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.270" offset="8912436">Now, the choice of the reorganization trustee to be President of the reorganized company in our view flies directly in the face of policy of Chapter 10 which requires that the trustee be disinterested, Section 156 of the Act specifically provides that the trustee as well as counsel for the trustee must be disinterested and this is defined in Section 158 of the Act, disinterested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.237" offset="9056319">It excludes specific persons such as creditors and the debtor, stockholders and the debtor, the underwriter of existing securities of the debtor, Directors, officers and employees of the debtor and there is a catch-all at the end and this too is on page four of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3717.168" offset="14972008">There are four issues involved in this case, four general areas of issues and I want to divide my time between the four of them, approximately 15 minutes each roughly, leaving Mr. Spitzer to take his part of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.586" offset="15053720">Now I'm going to discuss them in this order there is the question of insolvency, is the debtor insolvent, though the stockholders are to be excluded from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.695" offset="15094157">The second issue is about the employment of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.061" offset="15111607">You heard – been discussing that more than anything else here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.725" offset="15126235">The third is whether the stockholders should be invited by the Court to file recession claims based on the alleged frauds that took place back before the reorganization began.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.492" offset="15181302">We haven't had much discussion on that issue yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.184" offset="15200110">And the fourth issue is about the compromises of the claims, and we're talking about two claims, the Merrill-Stevens Claim, which I'll discuss and the Caplan mortgage claim which Mr. Spitzer will discuss because he is their attorney and one of the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.085" offset="15275760">And I'm going to take them up one at a time and I would appreciate the Court ask me questions about each one of these four things at the same time, although I have no objection to get operandi in the other, if you want -- if you feel it pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.674" offset="15338036">Now about insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.408" offset="15349008">There should be no question about this debtor being insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.730" offset="15370324">It's the weakest part in the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.276" offset="15380459">Let me just give you the facts and before I get into the facts on this, I want the Court to bear in mind that in every one of these issues, if you're going to reverse the Lower Court, you're going to have to take that record that stacks up this high and study those facts and place yourself in a position of that Trial Judge and ask and try to decide whether you would have decided those facts differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="4440.215" offset="17864182">Interest must be paid to creditors on their claims before stockholders can get anything if the company is solvent and the courts have so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.929" offset="17911097">So we are not talking about in this case $5,400,000 in claims, but through the years the interest on these claims would make the insolvency even greater than it would appear from the figures that I have given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.853" offset="17970761">Now the only real issue in this point is did the district court fail to consider evidence of probable growth of the business after reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.938" offset="18019140">The SEC's contention is that the law requires recognition of contemplated changes in operations and acquisitions that are likely to take place after reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.732" offset="18086327">They are indicated in this case that those changes will have to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.987" offset="18107329">These changes will have to take place because these old LSTs have got to be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.185" offset="18132093">They were expendable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.541" offset="18141497">They were built 22 years ago, and they were designed to be destroyed quickly and they don't have thick skins and this company spends tremendous sums of money every year to the Coast Guard, makes them bring them in, replate them and they just spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every year and it's in the record, keeping these old LSTs running, they've got to be replaced by more modern barges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.281" offset="18240449">So naturally the trustee is looking and thinking about replacing them and what's going to be the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.379" offset="18272841">It is going to cost from $1 million to $2 million to build another type vessel that will be efficient and you got to have, you got to replace all five of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.925" offset="18315055">But that's as far as the trustee can go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.074" offset="18327698">He can't commit in his planning the reorganized company what it's going to do to replace these vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.550" offset="18357582">He can't determine the financing of this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.958" offset="18371166">In fact the SEC even says, he shouldn't even be thinking about it and yet in their argument they say that the trustee should have brought in to the court an estimate of going-concern value based on prospective earnings in the future, based on new vessels and new financing of those vessels in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.269" offset="18456430">Now the trial court after hearing all this evidence on this subject, and we did have two experts that looked into the future and gave their opinion, the trial court said all this speculation about future profits and earnings on the change conditions with new vessels and new kind of financing is not reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.171" offset="18528005">The most reliable information is that which we have of the trustees' own operations and everything is in this record concerning what has been done under all the years of the trustees operations up to the time the two evaluation hearings were held and bear in mind that this plan has been through the mail twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.306" offset="18616613">It went through the mail once in 1962, it went up to the Appellate Court and came back and the same plan has been through the mail again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.958" offset="18655169">So we've had two evaluation hearings, one in 1962 and another one in 1965 and the trustees – and the Court found that the company in 1965 had not been making as much money as it had before the previous evaluation hearings and so it said that if it had to make another finding of going concern value it would be less now than it was at that time.</text>
