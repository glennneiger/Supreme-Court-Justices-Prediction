            <text syncTime="17.688" offset="174164">This is a Social Security disability case involving the question of the maximum fee to be awarded in a United States District Court, under the Social Security Act, to attorneys under the amendments to the Social Security Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.573" offset="277713">The factual background of the case in its very simplest form is that in January of 1961, the petitioner Raymond Hopkins and his wife and his two minor children, he on their behalf, filed an application for disability benefits under the Social Security Act and was awarded disability benefits commencing in March of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.742" offset="422327">The award of the disability benefits was on one piece of paper, a form -- standard form of the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.797" offset="466526">The applications were on three different pieces of paper for the wife, for Raymond Hopkins, and for his minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.683" offset="506128">By action of the Social Security Administration in 1962, late in the year in December, the disability benefits to Mr. Hopkins and the benefits of his wife and to his two minor children were terminated upon the contention by the Social Security Administration that he was no longer disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.072" offset="603617">On his own and without the benefit of counsel, in July -- on July 30, 1963, Mr. Hopkins filed a request for a rehearing, which rehearing was held October 9, 1963 in Danville, Illinois, and, the examiner's decision was announced on November 27, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="705599">Mr. Hopkins and his wife attended this hearing without counsel and had, at this point, not conferred with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.006" offset="751365">The decision was adverse to Mr. Hopkins and, the -- at that point, the examiner affirmed the decision of the Secretary to discontinue benefits, and this was appealed by me as counsel for Mr. Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.591" offset="817716">Appeals counsel of the Department-- of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Department of Social Security Administration, affirmed the decision of the hearing examiner and this case was first filed in the United States District Court in Lafayette, Indiana on July 2, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.248" offset="900368">On September 30, 1964 -- 1965, I'm sorry, the United States district judge in this case reversed the decision of the Social Security Administration and awarded benefits retroactive to January 1, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.725" offset="994304">The principal issue involved is an interpretation of one sentence of the Social Security Act, an amendment of the Social Security Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.875" offset="1046862">I might say, parenthetically, that this amendment is a very small part.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.955" offset="1071208">It's one sentence of the massive amendments that were added to the Social Security Act by the Congress in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.114" offset="1107780">It's been suggested in an opinion -- in several opinions, including one by the Fourth Circuit that the legislative history is somewhat scant.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.221" offset="1144247">As a matter of fact, they illustrate that there are some-350 pages of legislative history about the amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.983" offset="1175280">There are only two or three paragraphs about this particular sentence, but the sentence is 206 (b) (1) and the crucial part of it is that whenever a Court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant, under this sub-chapter, who is represented before the Court by an attorney, the Court may determine and allow, as a part of its judgment, a reasonable fee for such representations, not in excess of 25% of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled by a reason of such judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.922" offset="1475062">The first one is in the Senate Report No. 404.</text>

            <text syncTime="872.767" offset="3594428">And, I would say that it is in the record that there are several layers that turned him down because they didn't want to fool with this kind of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.376" offset="3624835">After -- while he was there in an atmosphere that he didn't understand, in a hearing where the evidence was taken down, he had extracted from him, by the hearing examiner, various types of omissions and leading questions and the sup -- in the opinion of Judge Ashborne in the Circuit Court, on September 30, 1965, he severely criticizes the conduct of the hearing examiner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.505" offset="3741341">There are other cases in which the conduct of hearing examiners in these cases have been severely criticized.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.715" offset="3778226">The significance of it is that when we go to the United States District Court, one should get a lawyer, as happened in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.271" offset="3820440">All you review is the evidence that's in the record, and at the -- in this case, Raymond Hopkins didn't have an attorney and he didn't make a very good record and, notwithstanding that, the United States district judge chose to reverse it, and rightfully so, on the merits of the question of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.745" offset="3898389">This is really important because, in interpreting the Congressional intention of the statute, I'm sure that it was not the con -- the intention of the Congress to so restrictively interpret this statute so as to a practical matter to discourage lawyers from handling these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.382" offset="3976861">And, may I say most respectfully, I will not argue here that if the Court affirms the Seventh Circuit and the Sixth Circuit and send that lawyers will quit handling these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.431" offset="4025135">I don't think that's true, but I will say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.000" offset="4039346">That it's my deep conviction and it's the deep conviction of many other people, that it will be a step towards seriously discouraging able and confident lawyers from representing these very needy people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.017" offset="4103398">There are an awful lot of these cases filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.863" offset="4114787">If you will look in the US Code annotations, there are thousands of them, and many of them reach the Appellate Court level.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.255" offset="8184351">This case is, of course, a -- presents a problem of statutory construction and in particular, it presents the problem of interpreting one word, “claimant,” in the sentence from Section 206 (b)(1) of the Social Security Act which Mr. Sharp read at the beginning of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.705" offset="8294170">Now, I shall turn to that language in a moment because it is the government's view that the phraseology of that language makes it clear that Congress, by the word “claimant,” meant “the man or woman or child who appears before the Court as a plaintiff and asks that Court to enter a judgment in his favor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.270" offset="8400436">But perhaps, in view of some of the questions that have been asked and some of the arguments that have been made, it would be useful if I reviewed briefly the history of attorney's fees in these cases, both in an administrative and judicial level, and the way in which an attorney gets into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.466" offset="8489253">The statute contemplates, I think, a three-stage procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.302" offset="8508583">First, there is a hearing before a hearing examiner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.509" offset="10201422">But, there's a countervailing consideration which I think appears from the legislative history of this statute, Justice Fortas, which is the concern of the Congress that contingent fee arrangements being used in District Courts were allowing fees that were so large that they were internally eating into these people's benefits, but the statute before this January allowed fees at the discretion of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.341" offset="10316779">At one time, the Secretary had a regulation saying that the fees would be very limited unless special application was made, and these were amounts I think that vary from $10-$50 and I think it's in connection with those limitations that are not in effect now, that much of the language in District Court opinions critical of the Secretary's position was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.626" offset="10429837">The statute, as presently drafted for administrative proceedings, allows a withholding from the past-due benefits to be paid directly to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.579" offset="10485739">Under the prior proceeding -- under the prior statute, when the proceedings were simply administrative, the Secretary would establish a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.920" offset="10527013">It was a misdemeanor to collect a higher fee than that one, but the lawyer was left to his own devices to collect the fee from the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.117" offset="10559822">The major change in the new statute, as I see it, is to set for a withholding scheme up to 25% of the maximum benefit at the administrative level.</text>
