            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 158, Fleming Smith, Petitioner, versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.393" offset="336959">Mr. Getty, I think you may proceed now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald W. Getty</label>
            <text syncTime="61.476" offset="349288">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.849" offset="370813">This is the case of Fleming Smith that originated in Illinois and has taken on appeal from the Illinois Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.028" offset="435493">The question involved here is the constitutional provision namely the Sixth Amendment and that part which states in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.054" offset="523577">We are also concerned about the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.339" offset="564746">The question as we see it presented for review is, should the informer's privilege be permitted to encroach upon the accused Sixth Amendment right to be confronted by witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.512" offset="649383">The facts of this particular case are -- as the normal case in a narcotic case where an addict is induced or the addict tells a police where he can supposedly make a purchase and this particular addict was searched and then escorted by two policemen to a restaurant on the South Side of Chicago, and there, this person by the name of James Jordan, and we do find from the record that this is not his correct name, did enter the restaurant and it is alleged and he did testify that he made a purchase of narcotics from one Fleming Smith in that restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.318" offset="904652">The two policemen are outside of the restaurant and certainly could not observed whether he did or did not make a purchase and they never testified to such things in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.038" offset="975496">The person, James Jordan, testified on the stand that he made the purchase from Fleming Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.387" offset="1024920">But when he was cross-examined and asked whether his name was James Jordan, there was an objection and further it was elicited finally that his name was not James Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.777" offset="1098480">And when it was asked whether -- what his name was, there was an objection and his name was never disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.136" offset="1135888">At that point, though they had produced this witness on the issue of guilt, it was denied, denied the facts and the defendant to know the person that was accusing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.622" offset="1213837">They took -- attempted to elicit the address of James Jordan and there was an objection and that was never disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.771" offset="1258454">When Fleming Smith took the stand, he denied any of the pur -- of the sale of narcotics to James Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.623" offset="1301817">Fleming Smith admitted that he was an addict and when he was arrested, sometime after James Jordan left the restaurant on February 28th, 1964, he did have a packet of narcotics on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.337" offset="1388753">He also had four single dollar bill on him that had been marked money.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.431" offset="1425115">The police at the time that James Jordan or just prior thereto entered -- that James Jordan entered the restaurant, did give him six $1 bills that were marked and four quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.340" offset="1488750">The purchase according to James Jordan was for $4 and 75 cents, a $5-bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.134" offset="1535875">The four quarters were never found on Fleming Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.094" offset="1555728">Fleming Smith explains in the trial the reason and why he had the four $1 bill is that he had just prior thereto paid for a restaurant bill and received them in change.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.452" offset="1641200">So that Fleming Smith at all times denied the sale.He said that James Jordan did approach him, he said he had no narcotics for sale but referred him to one Herbert Simpson in the rear of this restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.485" offset="1733360">Now the state in their brief presents the question, does the constitution require that the true identity and present address of a governmental informant be disclosed on cross-examination?</text>
            <text syncTime="424.700" offset="1802219">And our answer to that is yes, when it is on the issue of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.639" offset="1829909">This is not the case of the type of informer that merely points the finger of suspicion that the police depend upon for information, that type of person gives information to the police and there is a flow of information and we realized that this is probably one of the great scientific detection apparatus that law enforcement does have, the informant.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.315" offset="2524662">However we have a different problem where on a question of guilt and the man is produced, don't we have the right to know who this witness is that is presented against the defendant?</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.277" offset="6396531">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.991" offset="6411368">The issue that's presented in this case is actually revolves or is a takeoff from Rovario.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.866" offset="6446791">The Rovario this Court held that where the testimony of an informant -- the merits of the case is necessary for the defense, that the informant must be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.736" offset="6518366">However, we don't think that this is a -- and I don't believe that the Court intended this to be a blanket, unfettered disclosure of all informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.221" offset="6564237">I believe that it's needless to go into the importance of informants in the law enforcement field where necessity, actual necessity that we have this Court has recognized at that time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.011" offset="6623378">But the fact remains that we fully admit that if the testimony, the identity of an informant is necessary to allow a defendant to properly defend themselves, we agree that his name and identity should be revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.394" offset="6712926">However, in this situation that we feel, and as the Court said in Rovario, each case should be considered on its own and the rights of the people balanced against the rights of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.222" offset="6764231">Now in this situation, the defendant took the stand was subjected to a full cross-examination, the majority of this transcript as a cross-examination of James Jordan, the only thing that his name and true address could have possibly brought out with facts relating to his credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.446" offset="6865168">And as Mr. Justice Stewart aptly put it, how could his credibility been more destroyed than that to say that I was convicted on larceny, spent a year Vandalia, I was in (Inaudible) for burglary, I am an addict, presently an addict, I had a shot last week, (Inaudible) even rolled up the man's sleeve and pointed out the pinhole marks in his arm in front of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.286" offset="6972479">The judge observed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.575" offset="6981674">He stated, “I am presently under indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.083" offset="6991705">I come up in one month for trial,” what more could you say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.825" offset="7010722">This man's credibility is already destroyed as far as it's possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.911" offset="7035068">But the thing that the petitioner doesn't mention is that with the exception of the actual passage of the narcotics from Fleming Smith to James Jordan, every bit of a testimony of Fleming Smith was corroborated by two police officers.</text>
