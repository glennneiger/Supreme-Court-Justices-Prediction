            <text syncTime="20.952" offset="187225">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.928" offset="203107">I would -- the issued that I will discuss first this morning is the issue concerning the employment of the trustee by the reorganized company.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.900" offset="250964">The success of the trustee in operating the business of a data is best illustrated by the fact that when he took over in November of 1959 -- 1957, almost exactly 10 years ago, business was at a stand still.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.704" offset="346154">The ships were not moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.055" offset="355558">They were in bad need of repair and there was little hope for the business so everyone thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.105" offset="387741">Under his able management, the business grew to the point where by 1964, the end of the -- or 1965, when we began by the end of 1965, when we began to consummate the present plan of reorganization, the business was able to pay off in cash over $1,500,000 in claims being all of the preferred claims and all of the secured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.280" offset="556492">Of this sum, about $1,100,000 went to the United States Government for its tax and nontax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.948" offset="599124">And of -- and $250,000 went to the -- to pay off the Caplan mortgage, the compromise of the Caplan mortgage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.433" offset="645099">This -- the payment of this large sum of money to pay off all of these claimants in these two categories, did not come out of the earnings of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.009" offset="687417">Most of it came from a loan of $1,250,000 that the reorganized company was permitted by the Court to make from a bank in Florida, a long-term loan which reorg --</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Simmons, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="185.475" offset="845302">The earnings had been a great deal more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.984" offset="855333">Most of the earnings had been plowed back in to the business to purchase new or purchase more LST's.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.427" offset="889083">When the trustees took over, they were operating only three of these old World War II LST's.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.454" offset="917191">During his tenure, they have purchased and converted two more of the LST's so they're operating five.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.828" offset="950732">And most of the earnings of the business during that period of time had to be plowed back into additional assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.080" offset="983646">So it was inevitable, almost inevitable that persons who were interested in inquiring this company upon reorganization would want to retain the services of -- the good services of this trustee, and so it was has it been emphasized in all of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.914" offset="1071000">All of the plans of reorganization have contemplated the retention of the services of this trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.302" offset="1108616">The present plan of reorganization, this internal plan which I have described to the Court, was prepared by the committee appointed by the District Judge to represent the unsecured creditors as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.477" offset="1189282">This committee -- the larger creditors of course were represented by their own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.349" offset="1212792">And so the Court appended a committee of two experienced local attorneys to represent the general mass of the unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.626" offset="1253857">And this committee presented and suggested this internal plan of reorganization which included the two compromises of the claims that are among the issues here and also included a provision which contemplated the retention of the trustee's management by the reorganized company.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.362" offset="1332851">It did not require the retention of that management.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.431" offset="1349047">It merely permitted it and put everyone on notice that though -- the proponents of the plan contemplated the possible retention of the trustee and his good management team.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.631" offset="1405889">Now, our first point of course is that Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act does not preclude the employment of the trustee and all of the recorded cases thus far, that have touched on this subject have permitted the employment of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.783" offset="1482480">Or rather more accurately stated, cases as cited in the brief of the Securities and Exchange Commission, they have cited to the Court instances where the trustee has been retained or employed by a reorganized company.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.422" offset="1545070">And there is no -- there are no decisions where that has been prohibited as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.334" offset="1568684">It appears to us that the matter is left entirely to the discretion of the District Court under Section 221 (5) of the Bankruptcy Act, which simply requires a complete disclosure of the identity, qualifications and affiliations of the persons who are to be the initial directors and officers of the reorganized company and the finding that their appointment by the Court would be compatible with the interest of the data and consistent with public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.566" offset="1693654">We think this is a finding of fact to be made in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.172" offset="1708074">It has been made in this case by the District Judge that this trustee's retention would be in the best interest of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.436" offset="1745168">The opposing contention is based upon an interpretation of Sections 156 and 158 of the Bankruptcy Act, which pertain to the appointment of a disinterested trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.956" offset="1815176">But nothing in those statutes asses or implies that an interest in employment by the reorganized company is a disqualification to act as trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.129" offset="1859897">Opposing counsel would write into the statute a meaning that is not stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.670" offset="1882049">Their position is not sound and presupposes that a trustee will necessarily breach his trust if he contemplates continuation of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.471" offset="1933249">This is contrary to human experience or a person with an incentive will do a better job than one who knows that his services will be terminated no matter how well he performs.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.957" offset="2003153">Opposing argument of opposing counsel of course overlooks the benefits to the data of being able to retain the services of a good and successful trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.415" offset="2041083">It also overlooks the fact that all of the trustee's actions are subject to court approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.826" offset="2078699">The criticism that you have heard here yesterday expressed of this trustee and the things that he did involve matters that were all approved by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.713" offset="2126242">For example, the towing contract, the award of a towing contract was criticized and the recommendation of the compromise of these two large claims was criticized.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.799" offset="2182562">But both of those matters have been the subject of many hearings in court and an opportunity to be heard by all parties and throughout this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.027" offset="2231463">That has been true with respect to all actions of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.661" offset="2245987">They have been subjected to a great deal of scrutiny, a great deal of criticism by the Stockholders Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.598" offset="2269811">Does the record show the background to this trustee and (Inaudible)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_p_simmons_jr" startTime="547.916" stopTime="1081.419">
            <label>Mr. William P. Simmons, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="547.916" offset="2294993">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.274" offset="2300426">The trustee is a retired successful merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.185" offset="2328116">For many years, he was a manager of a large retail department store and a successful reputable businessman in Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.830" offset="2370644">He'd lived in Miami for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.524" offset="2377435">He'd been associated with large department stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.784" offset="2386526">This is well-known in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.011" offset="2395408">He'd retired and the Court appointed him as trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.311" offset="2412648">He'd had no interest or knowledge of TMT at all before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.876" offset="2430830">He'd been in the -- he's just a good businessman and he brought to the trusteeship with him the man that had been his general manager and right-hand man in the retail merchandizing business, Mr. (Inaudible), who brought a great deal of know-how and sound business methods to this trusteeship.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.423" offset="2521109">It would appear that opposing counsel would write into the Bankruptcy Act something that Congress has not written into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.625" offset="2569906">And I think it was admitted yesterday that in 1948 or 1958, the SEC sponsored enacting Congress that would have expressly prohibited the employment of a trustee for a period of two years after the conclusion of reorganization proceedings and it would appear that the SEC knows that Congress has not yet prohibited the employment of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.408" offset="2689024">So we say that the Fifth Circuit placed a proper construction on the statutes involved here when it held that the proponents of the plan that that -- what the -- the dis -- the appellate court held that the trustee is not disinterested unless the proponents of the plan assured him of emoluments and security rather than merely nominating him for approval by the Court and subject to the usual control of the board of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.322" offset="2820681">Now, one of the most imp -- significant factors in this whole issue is that, no attempt has been made to disqualify this trustee because of his interest in employment by the reorganized company or for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.487" offset="2905318">If the position of opposing counsel is correct, this trustee has been disqualified since early 1959 for that was the first time when a plan of reorganization was proposed that contemplated his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.213" offset="2988178">Every plan has contemplated his employment since early 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.984" offset="3019316">So we say to the Court that it is too late now to urge that his past disqualification prohibits him from being employed in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.126" offset="3079920">The plan has been substantially consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.564" offset="3097579">New directors have taken over the operations of the business and are running the company with this trustee in his team in charge of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.759" offset="3138435">It would be highly inequitable to re -- now require the reorganized company to fire him and force him -- enforce it to employ a less qualified person to run the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.513" offset="3201442">We say that the petitioner and the Securities and Exchange Commission are now estopped to raise this question after having permitted the trustee for eight years to operate the business of this data, knowing all that time that he was being considered for employment by the reorganized company without coming in and specifically asking the Court to remove him for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.597" offset="3329755">Another point that I want to emphasize is, that this issue was decided by the Fifth Circuit in its 1964 decision when this plan of reorganization was first reviewed by that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.512" offset="3401435">You recall it has been reviewed twice and we're here after the second review.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.058" offset="3435604">The very provisions of the plan that are here now were before the Fifth Circuit in 1964 and the Fifth Circuit upheld those provisions in the plan with respect to the employment of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.183" offset="3496103">Therefore, that decision became the law of the case for no appeal was taken from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.622" offset="3533824">And we say that this Court should now recognize under the circumstances of this case, the law of the case on the question of the trustee's employment as it was decided by the Fifth Circuit in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.179" offset="3600071">When the Fifth Circuit sent the plan back in 1964, it sent it back only to determine its feasibility in the light of the companion decision which it made in another case requiring payment in full of the Government nontax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.867" offset="3690872">These claims amounted to $900,000 so there was a question as to whether the data would be able to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.188" offset="3716159">But by means of this bank loan that I referred to a while ago, the $1,250,000 borrowed in that amount of money, the data was able to pay the Government nontax claims in full as well, as I have said, all other preferred and secured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.028" offset="3783450">So the plan of reorganization that we now have before us, the amended plan is amended only in one particular, one material particular: that is to provide for the payment of the nontax claims of the Government in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.153" offset="3843950">It was not amended in any particular with respect to the employment of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.212" offset="3868191">And the amended plan that we have here now approves the appointment of the same officers and directors of the reorganized company as the first plan did back in 1964 when it first went to the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.609" offset="3949798">Now the Court well knows that the law of the case is a salutary one designed to end litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.339" offset="3980727">And under the decisions of this and other courts, it should be recognized and followed, unless there are impelling reasons for reversing the former decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.703" offset="4030151">On the contrary in this case, there are impelling reasons for allowing it to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.373" offset="4056900">Number one, there's been no effort to remove the trustee, as I have pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.449" offset="4081142">Number two, the creditors, who are the real parties in interest here, want to retain the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.346" offset="4108727">Not a single creditor, not one, has come forward to object to the employment of the trustee by the reorganized company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.891" offset="4146970">These creditors of course are now the new stockholders, the new owners of the reorganized company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.381" offset="4172884">On the contrary, they have urged to the District Court the approval of his appointment or his being a director and the president of the reorganized company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.849" offset="4222725">Third, substantial consummation of this plan has taken place as I have previously described to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1172.725" offset="4794284">It was asserted from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.714" offset="4802226">It was asserted that the trustee for example, for some reason favored the towing company that he recommended that the towing contract was awarded to that that the fact that he awarded the -- recommended the award of the contract without competitive bidding or something like that, indicated that he favored that company as against maybe somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.296" offset="4904521">And these things were asserted but -- well that particular issue was heard in connection with the towing contract and overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.176" offset="4932106">The Court approved the award of the towing contract to the company recommended by the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.260" offset="4956453">That's the way these things came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.691" offset="4966170">On individual issues and actions of the trustee, they would object to him and the Court would enter an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.071" offset="4991666">And in no time was a clear cut issue presented to the Court that the trustee was disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.242" offset="5036387">The next issue is the -- that I will discuss is the matter of the compromise of the lien claims against the vessels of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.445" offset="5089155">Now, when this plan came back from the appellate court in 1964 and the appellate court had held that that this $900,000, a nontax claim to the Government had to be paid in full in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.624" offset="5157909">It posed a real practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.935" offset="5175150">In addition -- because in addition to this $1 million -- actually $1 million one -- $1,200,000 in tax and preferred claims that had to be paid in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.439" offset="5241083">There were these lien claims against the vessels of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.903" offset="5263026">I'm adding to approximately a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.884" offset="5278908">Well something had to give or it would not be able to work out a plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.586" offset="5305762">So, it was inevitable that settlement discussion would take place with respect to these lien claims against the vessels of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.309" offset="5340557">The two largest lien claims were the ones in controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.533" offset="5373471">The Caplan mortgage was in the principal sum of $330,000 and it was a preferred ship mortgage on all the vessels of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.052" offset="5431568">The other lien claim was the $574,000 lien -- series of lien claims again -- by Merrill-Stevens against all of the vessels of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.772" offset="5482454">So with the approval of the Court and the knowledge of everyone concerned, settlement discussions took place between the trustee, the trustee's counsel and counsel for these creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.104" offset="5535744">And the result was that when this creditors committee proposed the present internal plan of reorganization, that plan included in it as an integral part the proposed compromises of these two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.298" offset="5608573">The Caplan mortgage claim of base amount of $330,000, which had added to it interest, cost and attorney's fees which would have make it at least $500,000, was reduced to $250,000 payable in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.439" offset="5685164">And that -- and in connection with the consummation of the plan that has taken place, that $250,000 has been paid to the Caplan mortgage trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.340" offset="5744724">The only other fact in that compromise was that the interest due -- accrued interest due on that mortgage was paid against common stock of the reorganized company or satisfied by giving them common stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.773" offset="5806477">Now, the Merrill-Stevens claim, lien claims against the vessel amounted to $574,000 and the compromised with Merrill-Stevens provided that those claims would be taken off of the vessels entirely and that amount would become an unsecured claim payable in common stock of the reorganized company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.434" offset="5893099">And that was the settlement there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.821" offset="5902608">The result of these two compromises meant that the plan was feasible; that instead of having to pay up perhaps puts to a million dollars or satisfied puts to a million dollars in lien claims of preferred ship mortgage claims against the vessels of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.365" offset="5976795">The data would only have to pay $250,000 and the balance in the common stock of the reorganized company which it didn't cost him anything in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.759" offset="6014412">And as a result of these compromises, the plan was made feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.246" offset="6044400">Now, the objections to the compromises are, the SEC states in its brief that the record contains insufficient facts for the Court to form, to make an informed judgment of -- on the merits of the compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.781" offset="6126529">The petitioner, the Stockholders Committee, in addition says there was inadequate investigation of the objections to these two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.643" offset="6173968">Now neither of these contentions is sustained by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.322" offset="6192671">I'm not going to discuss the Caplan mortgage claim and the terrific investigation that was made of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.755" offset="6218376">It's stated in our brief and Mr. Spitzer represents the Caplan mortgage people and will go into the details of that during his time before the Court when I finish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.257" offset="6260381">But, with respect to the Merrill-Stevens claim, we've outlined in our brief the numerous pleadings and places in the record where the facts concerning this claim and particularly the objections to it are set forth in great detail particularly by opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.239" offset="6340315">And insofar as investigation is concerned, the record shows as we point out in our brief that no less than four investigations were made of the Merrill-Stevens claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.778" offset="6390471">There is a reference in the record to a trustee's investigation in 1959 which he reported in his opinion, the amount of the claim and so far the value of Merrill-Stevens services was concerned was substantially awarded or justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.430" offset="6465076">Admittedly, that wasn't much of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.246" offset="6476361">We don't have much in the record on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.083" offset="6491721">The next investigation was the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation in 1961, and they reported that rather thoroughly to the Court and to -- in his own record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.064" offset="6611675">Bear in mind that the total amount of the claim was $1,600,000 and there is little objection to the fact that Merrill-Stevens did perform extensive work on the vessel and for which it was not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.475" offset="6669249">And there's little dispute as to the amount of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.271" offset="6684505">But the SEC objections stated that Merrill-Stevens did not -- the main objections are -- with respect to the million dollar claim against the Carib Queen for rebuilding the Carib Queen, Merrill-Stevens did not properly convert the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.384" offset="6756916">They did not comply with the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.818" offset="6770604">They did not properly repair the vessel and they fail to establish the value of its work and materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.666" offset="6814072">And in addition, the petitioner in its charges against -- objections to the Merrill-Stevens claim, repeated what the SEC had said and went on to say to charge that Merrill-Stevens is liable in thought for negligence in performing the work on the vessel causing in part the downfall of TMT.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.608" offset="6921801">They also charged that Merrill-Stevens bought stock in TMT for which it has not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.781" offset="6954506">And that is a substance of the charges that they made against Merrill-Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.444" offset="6985122">Merrill-Stevens filed pleadings denying all of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.290" offset="7004557">And in addition to the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and the Stockholders Committee investigation, the trustee or rather -- our firm, as counsel for the trustee, took all of these information that was made available to us by the SEC and the Stockholders Committee and by Merrill-Stevens and made an off-the-record investigation of all of these things just as attorneys always do in connect -- when the question of settlement of a claim is being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.141" offset="7163904">We studied all of these and reported to the Court that -- as follows, two attorneys in the office of counsel for the trustee have examined the factual data, gathered in the trustee's investigation of the objections to the Merrill-Stevens claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.118" offset="7239868">And it is the considered opinion of both attorneys that the possibility is remote of obtaining any reduction or material reduction in the amount of the Merrill-Stevens claim by litigating the objections against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.426" offset="7293053">Trial of the issues raised by the objections would be time consuming and would result in unnecessary delay in formulating a plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.824" offset="7338715">That is our considered judgment of this compromise as attorneys for the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.207" offset="7368182">And I say to the Court and all candidates, one thing to sit up in your office and prepare pleadings and make objections and file fraud charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.353" offset="7404753">But it's quite another thing when you're on the firing line and have to make the decision as to whether you're going to file a lawsuit by the claim or compromise it on a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.923" offset="7451042">And we advise the trustee and we advise the Court that this compromise should be accepted and the Court accepted our opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2818.206" offset="11376201">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.556" offset="11389576">It's perhaps a searing emotional experience to sit at the counsel table of this Court and because one is an (Inaudible) trustee to find oneself receiving the phrasal and invective employed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.064" offset="11467630">I suppose if one could be objective about it, would be alleviated by knowing that everybody else connected with this proceeding whether it be the trustee, its counsel, the creditors, even to some extent, the District Court and even some members of the panel of the -- the panels that sat in the Fifth Court of Appeals are included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.767" offset="11558431">Perhaps it mitigates, it doesn't eliminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.860" offset="11570761">And if there's any emotion in my argument, I hope the Court will indulge me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.265" offset="11592391">I appear solely on behalf of the Caplan mortgage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.904" offset="11619035">Your Honors will find in the briefs which is so highly critical, there isn't a word as to the nature of those claims, of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.935" offset="11651114">Some $330,000 and fresh new money, it was paid for a note in that amount secured by two mortgages for plainly disclosed investors and for shares of stock having a described value of $49,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.380" offset="11712867">A little over two-thirds of that money was immediately on the direction of the data transmitted to the (Inaudible) National Bank to pay for an installment of interest in principal on a maritime mortgage guaranteed by the United States Maritime Administration and thereby redounded for the benefit of the Government by reducing its liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.368" offset="11792802">The greater part of the balance was used to clear liens and libels on other vessels to which it would now be subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.137" offset="11823940">The claim presently would be something substantially, substantially in excess of a half million dollars with interest at a 6% rate provided for in the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.264" offset="11868453">This has been settled for the sum of $250,000 with the interest subordinated to that of a general claim with no voice whatsoever in the reorganized corporation, except as a minority stockholder having roughly 3% of the outstanding stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.220" offset="11940237">Let me it very plain irrespective of what the brief say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.098" offset="11951731">The plan is clear, the record is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.906" offset="11963016">We never sought, we never obtained and there has been no disposition of any claims against any participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.507" offset="11993422">I appear here solely on behalf of the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.167" offset="12008051">If the data or state desires to sue any individual participant, we have never blocked it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.652" offset="12029994">I want to be also clear on one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.485" offset="12041279">The position of the Caplan mortgage trustees from the inception has been plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.789" offset="12058520">We immediately filed a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.358" offset="12068760">We made opposition claim, we said we were first mortgagees, subject and subordinate to no claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.668" offset="12098017">For two and a half years, neither petitioner nor the SEC filed any objections whatsoever to our client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.575" offset="12133648">A plan of reorganization was promulgated which incorporated a compromise, not at our request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.179" offset="12160084">We have never once requested any compromise on our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.716" offset="12178265">We have manfully stood up and taken our position and read -- and been ready to defend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.922" offset="12199058">It was only after we petitioned for a leave to foreclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.626" offset="12217866">When it was denied we went to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.240" offset="12228315">The Court of Appeals reversed, remanded and directed that we be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.672" offset="12246079">When the Court referred it to a special master, we took a second appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.384" offset="12260916">And during the pendency of that appeal, the trustee and the creditors requested that we compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.474" offset="12281292">We were prepared to accept the compromise or litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.739" offset="12294353">The matter was incorporated in a plan of reorganization which was approved and confirmed and let me make it plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.001" offset="12319326">There was no objection of any kind to our claim at this point by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.151" offset="12347956">When the plan was ready to be consummated, the SEC requested an investigation of our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.204" offset="12372198">We immediately consented in any form, manner or shape that was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.686" offset="12394141">There was an investigation that took place from January 29 to May 4, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.095" offset="12419741">It was conducted by the reorganization and trustee and his counsel and by four members of the staff of the SEC, two of their attorneys and two of their investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.484" offset="12465298">There was some 33 persons interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.927" offset="12479091">There was some 2200 pages of testimony transcribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.601" offset="12497795">There was some 60 exhibits that were introduced in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.864" offset="12514826">And while we flatly disagreed with the conclusion of the reorganization trustee, at least he was fair enough to say that the Caplan mortgage trustees and the participants gave every possible cooperation, we testified everything that was asked for, we produced every record that was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.213" offset="12592253">May I say to Your Honors that when the Court originally passed upon the plan of reorganization incorporating our compromise of our claim it had before it everything that the combined and cumulative efforts of counsel for the trustee, counsel for the SEC, counsel for the creditors and counsel for the petitioner could bring before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.743" offset="12698311">Now in one respect, I see I have only five minutes and I'd hope I'd have more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.404" offset="12717014">In one respect I must disagree with Mr. Simmons with respect to our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.578" offset="12745644">The charges of fraud whenever refuted as what stated yesterday, we filed a claim, there was no objection filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.882" offset="12770931">Now, let me tell you exactly what transpired and there -- what hearings with respect to our claim before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.297" offset="12796531">On April 24th, 1962, after the plan was -- the present plan was prepared, eight days before it was submitted for approval, counsel for the petitioner interrogated the trustee with respect to outstanding litigation and claims that would be litigated and it went into causes of action, patent claims, the Wilmington transaction and Merrill-Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.737" offset="12890363">And I say to Your Honors that not one question was propounded with respect to any defense to our claim or to any claims against our participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.141" offset="12935920">Eight days later, the plan came up for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.234" offset="12948355">Again, petitioner's counsel interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.319" offset="12960684">There wasn't again one question asked with respect to our claim and this was when it was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.027" offset="12987434">Now with respect to the SEC on the approval, the SEC's counsel questioned the trustee as to what were his reasons for approving this compromised provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.528" offset="13041455">The Court stated that it had a jury waiting to come in, it had another case ready for the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.044" offset="13063502">And if there was time desired to review this matter, it would set the matter down for another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.691" offset="13086177">At this point, SEC counsel stated and I quote from record 2, page 283, “speaking for my self Your Honor, I have concluded”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.300" offset="13132570">Now it is asserted in the reply brief that we imply that they were satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.611" offset="13149811">I make no implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.190" offset="13156080">Satisfied or not, they had the opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.575" offset="13169664">They were requested by the Court, “If you want this matter set down for a day certain, we will do it” but they didn't want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.933" offset="13191084">What they wanted really was and they then requested the trustee of state, how did they arrive at the compromise which he stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.527" offset="13229432">The Court then submitted a memorandum at a later date that there was insufficient on the record of proof.This was not the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.331" offset="13260675">This was in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.370" offset="13268825">The matter went up to the Court of Appeals and at that time, the counsel for the trustee set forth the various reasons for the compromise of our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.826" offset="13302680">There was a reversal, as Your Honors know, because of the priority status of the Government's nontax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.739" offset="13330369">When the matter was remanded and came before the Court again, on November 4th, 1964 SEC counsel inquired as to the general manager whether any attempt had been made to negotiate a more favorable settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.887" offset="13390869">It was answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.194" offset="13396198">No effort whatsoever was made to impugn the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.521" offset="13417409">They disagree with the reasons for the settlement to request us to appear and testify and we've been ready on any and every occasion or to produce any testimony whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.272" offset="13460459">There was a further hearing on January 19th, 1965 where SEC counsel inquired the reorganization trustee's counsel as to the status of litigation even with respect to the Caplan mortgage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.913" offset="13515003">Again, there was no request for any interrogation, any criticism whatsoever with respect to this compromised provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.842" offset="13546768">And during all these period, petitioner's counsel which portrays itself fulfilling such a heroic role in uncovering all these matters stood there silent (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.205" offset="13592221">No interrogation, no inquiry whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.899" offset="13606954">I say to Your Honors that the contention that this record is inadequate or that the District Court acted improvidently with respect to our claim and I am here only on behalf of our claim is absolutely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.619" offset="13657840">And may I make it perfectly plain that the United States Government, which is the -- one of the largest creditors, has not objected to this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.728" offset="13702248">And may I also add one further thing with respect to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.375" offset="13716877">In 1959, the United States Department of Justice, at a hearing before the Court, set forth on the record that it had made an investigation of our claim that it had interrogated our representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.995" offset="13771316">With our consent had gone through all books, records and documents and were thoroughly satisfied with respect to this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.795" offset="13802559">I know that I can't go further that I had wanted to present certain -- the aspect of the two, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.063" offset="13823666">I merely want to point out to you that we are in this position at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.541" offset="13841533">We have compromised twice, thinking that we had eliminated the problem, apparently we haven't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.615" offset="13869850">We have surrendered our mortgages at the direction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.065" offset="13891584">We no longer even have those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.347" offset="13900779">Our property is now subject and subordinate to a mortgage that was issued to fulfill and consummate this plan of reorganization to that mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.417" offset="13941008">Neither the SEC nor the petitioner objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.206" offset="13952188">We are afforded in an absolutely untenable position as a result of no efforts on our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.049" offset="13975594">We have done nothing to deserve this situation today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.285" offset="13988551">We have been prepared to substantiate our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.702" offset="14002134">We have filed our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.076" offset="14007672">We have been ready to fight and we have never been afforded the opportunity to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3764.624" offset="15161866">I say, sir that Mr. Spitzer cannot come here and talk about equities when all compromises, when our position on it, Mr. Justice Black, is not on the merits of the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.115" offset="15231875">He may have a good mortgage; he may have a bad mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.713" offset="15246190">Our position on it from the first was that he was not or his clients were not in any position of being able to assert their commercial rights under the mortgage because they were in fact acting as cloaks for people who wrecked this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.276" offset="15332498">And that no matter what the commercial situation with respect to the mortgage, the trustee at first brought that very bitterly that they cannot estop anybody because they are covers for frauds.This was a position that we wondered about to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.973" offset="15411284">Very early in the proceedings, Mr. Spitzer was asked in open court, “Is there is Mr. Joe Abrams interested in or who is a part of that group?”,referring to his settings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.490" offset="15477321">Mr. Spitzer: “There is no Joe -- Mr. Joe Abrams in our group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.825" offset="15494666">He has an interest in I believe in -- no there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.697" offset="15514206">No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.185" offset="15528103">So, at that point, there was a disclaimer of any interest by -- in the group by the man who was primarily along with his other client, Mr. Shaffer, so the trustee found in his ultimate investigation the prime record of this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.473" offset="15621308">It was only when we turned up evidence which we tended to the trustee in which he rejected that there really was a Joe Abrams behind this and when the SEC turned up more evidence that ultimately the trustee was forced to set aside his first plan which it turned the whole company over to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.467" offset="15721200">Now, this is the reason that we say that they cannot be in a position of saying, “We're innocent equity people here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.740" offset="15762369">We have equities with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.542" offset="15773550">We were sucked into a compromise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.534" offset="15789537">We say that they were sucked into a compromise, the terms of that compromise whenever fully disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.633" offset="15817853">The basis for that compromise was never fully disclosed as I argued yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.574" offset="15837706">What right therefore do they have to sit here innocently and say, “Everybody is estopped?</text>

            <text syncTime="4182.380" offset="16832867">It is our responsibility to the people whom we represent, some 7000 stockholders, who have paid many millions of dollars under this fraudulent scheme to float stock, how much of it reached the company ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.361" offset="16896815">It doesn't appear in the record but we know from the extent of the record that has been made, a good deal of it, many hundreds of thousand dollars of it were (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.188" offset="16936103">Our position here is to point out what needs to be done, to suggest what needs to be done, to try and do it if it isn't done.</text>

            <text syncTime="4240.451" offset="17065148">We think we've done all that we needed to do as the Court's responsibility and the trustee's fiduciary responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.554" offset="17093569">Let me turn more directly now, if I may, to Mr. Simmons' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.569" offset="17125648">I'd like to address myself to something he said at the very start of his discussion which he said it's going to be necessary for this Court to read all seven volumes of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.801" offset="17174549">I'm afraid as I said yesterday that it was going to be necessary for the Court to read a little more of this record than I would like to have read just because of these matters of detail of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.557" offset="17221569">But none of it is the kind of thing that this Court ordinarily refuses to read by way of looking over to see whether or not a District Judge has made appropriate findings of fact on an issue presented to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.103" offset="17299832">Of course there are disputes of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.921" offset="17315088">Mr. Simmons insists that there never wasn't a -- any real charges of fraud by us against Merrill-Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.612" offset="17349778">And all we can do is ask the Court to read our specifications in which we say that they joined themselves in with the basic Shaffer-Spitzer we call it, it could just as well be called Abrams and Shaffer because they are the ultimate defrauders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.128" offset="17427832">Mr. Shaffer and Mr. Spitzer in our view are merely gnawing close for Shaffer himself and Abrams as himself on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.713" offset="17486242">We objected to the claim on fraud grounds because there were misrepresentation as to this Carib Queen as to her speed, her performance, whether or not she'd been mortgaged out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.486" offset="17537337">All these matters that were essential to the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.112" offset="17547786">This, the Court will have to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.005" offset="17559385">Likewise, I think the Court is going to have to just see whether I'm right or whether Mr. Spitzer is right when he says both in his brief and here that the group behind the Shaffer-Spitzer mortgage was “plainly disclosed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.322" offset="17632632">The briefs themselves operators and indexed to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.433" offset="17645066">But the most important thing that I'd do want to state with respect to this question of how much you have to read is really an answer to the question that I started to answer yesterday when Justice Fortas asked me about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.115" offset="17687803">But what do we want here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.559" offset="17697625">It's our position that nothing that we want is going to require this Court to review and reverse determinations of fact made by the District Court even where we asked for review of something that is a mix batch in effect in law, the matter of insolvency evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.992" offset="17807339">What we're objecting to there is the adoption and the enforcement of a rule of law by the District Court which we say is in -- just counter distinction to the rules of law that this Court had always enforced and said in the area of evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.302" offset="17904619">That it is necessarily a matter of future, I think that it is necessarily a matter or probability and that all evidence which now exists bearing on the future earnings of the company must be presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.181" offset="17980061">And for that reason we say that it is not necessary to discuss even on this one question which might be of question of fact, any of the detailed underlying facts because the facts are really admitted in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.824" offset="18038680">The disputes of facts are fringed disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.835" offset="18054666">The facts of the case are undisputed on that, that you cannot value we think a company, which during the reorganization has grown from 300 to 600 trailers from three to five ships as this Court -- the District Court insisted it be valued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.302" offset="18132616">As it is now, a three-ship company, when their turning away business all the time and find new ships and planning improved ships and spending estate money on those plans and spending a estate time on those plans, this is a matter of law, this is not a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.906" offset="18210983">Similarly, on the question whether there should be a full investigation, it is a matter of law we say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.451" offset="18257168">Four courts we've cited in the brief, four of the Circuits have said that you've got to have a full investigation on the record instead of the kind of investigation that was had here off the record with the trustee even turning down and objecting to us and blocking us when we wanted to get discovery of some of the most important facts here that we had found in third-party hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.897" offset="18354970">Similarly, when we say that there must be a full disclosure of the basis of compromise, it is a fact that the compromise basis was not stated on the record and three more of the Circuit Courts which we've cited in the briefs have said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.166" offset="18443995">It's our view that it's this Court's function and responsibility in response really to Justice Fortas' question as what we want here, to make it clear that the law is the same in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.969" offset="18507212">And the law should be the same throughout the country so that we don't have the danger of what happens, what is traditionally happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.937" offset="18543156">What caused Chapter X, people without any supervision, running bankruptcies to suit themselves, friendly trustees, private deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.504" offset="18613373">Another thing that we think the Court must enunciate as a rule of law here is that the trustee must put under an affirmative duty to bring in to the record all the evidence that there's on valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.190" offset="18672097">Mr. Simmons, I'm sure inadvertently made a mistake -- meant there when he said, that our own expert, the committee's expert valued this property at only $4,500,000 as a going concern value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.922" offset="18743045">There is a passage in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.223" offset="18756315">I could quote it but I will cite it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.799" offset="18762585">We've also cited it on the brief at pages 246 to 248 of the record that we call Roman II here in which the thrust -- in which our officer says -- our -- I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.688" offset="18834160">In which our expert says that the officers of the company, the trustee, have not furnished him with only information he needs to determine how much higher, how much higher than $4,500,000 it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.608" offset="18909811">Our expert did not make a valuation in terms of -- this is the figure, he said that this is the minimum figure and the reason I haven't been able to get a higher figure is because the trustee can't -- wouldn't furnish me the information that's necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.790" offset="18978565">That's in the record and I have discussed --</text>

            <text syncTime="4766.192" offset="19168110">That question was never ventilated below in the Court of Appeals because of the fact that the District Judge erroneously held and we think this is again holding as a matter of law that we were barred from raising the question because of laches.</text>

            <text syncTime="4792.311" offset="19272600">We say on that point that laches under the doctrines of this Court, and we've cited the (Inaudible) case in our brief that laches is a question of fact and that the District Judge has no authority as a matter of law, not as a matter of fact, to make a finding that we were in laches until there'd been a hearing on that question determining what would the excuses for our delay, what were the consequences, who was hurt by our delay as well as did we in fact delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.209" offset="19436231">This is not a matter of bickering over facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.682" offset="19446053">This is a matter of acting on agreed facts, facts which are indisputable in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.678" offset="19478131">There must also be, we say, by way of remedy here, a real review under Section 221 (5) which requires the judge to look over the whole cause of the proceedings and determine before he approves the plan, before he confirms it rather, that there has been an independent trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.759" offset="19574366">This is not a fact question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.596" offset="19585755">We think we have developed the facts which demonstrate that this trustee had been acting under conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.994" offset="19611355">The question is not whether he was corrupt but as this Court had said whether he had the opportunity for corruption and whether he had placed himself in a position where it can't be told, it can't be determined what he has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.231" offset="19672273">It -- none of this is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.440" offset="19685125">The trustee, we say, must go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.249" offset="19712397">It is not important really whether the trustee has the job as president of this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.078" offset="19739669">What is important is that whether by a director's instruction in the mandate, unmistakable language in the opinion, it must be made plain that the plan must be vacated and that any other plan by a man who has acted in conflict of interest will also be vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.067" offset="19827649">This is a conclusion that we reached in our brief when we asked for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.230" offset="19844263">The SEC which has supported us throughout in this proceeding long before the particular questions that Mr. Ferber argued yesterday were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.085" offset="19883760">The SEC had reached the same conclusion and the conclusion of its -- stated in somewhat differentlanguage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.800" offset="19922526">It is our view that all of these things are things that the Court can do, the Court can order done in a mandate or indicate must be done in an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.413" offset="19977070">That's what's necessary to claim this reorganization now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.578" offset="20013641">I would like to refer very briefly to some of Mr. Simmons' particular contentions that there was little dispute as to the amount of the Merrill-Stevens claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.087" offset="20067767">There was a dispute as the amount of the Merrill-Stevens claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.685" offset="20082082">The SEC objected to its allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.292" offset="20096502">At Roman II 1094 of the record that the SEC asked for a hearing on our particular objections to the Merrill-Stevens claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.323" offset="20148642">It said that after those new specifications at large charging fraud were in the record that there must be a hearing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.657" offset="20186049">Finally, on this detailed points, it is important just to notice with respect to the suits, the objections to the various claims, the suits that were dropped, but what we're objecting to is that although each plan said that suits are reserved, all suits are reserved, all causes of action reserved that the trustee did not just make on the advise of his counsel that judgment of these were not worthy of prosecution, but that he made a deal not to prosecute them; that it was part of the deal and it was only disclosed in part three years later and another part four years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="5085.015" offset="20443408">I think that passage of it, Your Honor, is already in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.619" offset="20461798">I know it's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.721" offset="20466291">We've cited it in the record particularly in our reply brief when there was a contention that everything was disclosed at the Shaffer-Spitzer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.613" offset="20501817">We've cited the passages in the record in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.081" offset="20519685">One final point on the law of the case, Mr. Simmons has made again I think in inadvertent statement which he said that the plan was returned at the time of the second appeal only, and I'm quoting him, for determination of its feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.758" offset="20634415">He is I think quoting but the District Court said that it was returned only for determination of its feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.235" offset="20684361">On the third appeal whether its contention was made that the law of the case covered everything and I quote from the third appeal 364 F.2d at 936, where the District Court said the decisions of the appellate court sent the plan of reorganization back only for determined feasibility of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.993" offset="20795329">The Fifth Circuit said on the third appeal, “We do not agree but hold that this Court's reversal of the order of confirmation left open those issues not in terms discussed and decided”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.122" offset="20855829">The only issue that was discussed and decided with respect to us was the matter or decided against us was the prophylactic barring of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.416" offset="20909014">This is why we say that the Fifth Circuit did not exercise its supervisory function and why this Court has to step in and exercise its supervisory function because on each of the first two appeals where we had raised all almost of these questions, although the plans were set aside and this is important, perhaps I didn't make this clear in response to your question yesterday, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.907" offset="21030954">On our first appeal of claim was set aside and our second appeal, the claim was set aside but they were set aside on collateral grounds which the Fifth Circuit did not find necessary to consider the particular questions that we had raised except by indirection where it said that the Court could act, the court below on the first appeal could act on the findings ofthe trustee had belatedly made with respect to the Shaffer-Spitzer and could set aside the first plan for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.751" offset="21170343">This is the reason why we've brought the case here under the supervisory power primarily and this is the reason why we say that there can be a mandate and there can be instructions and there can be an opinion that without going into details bickerings about petty facts here, acting only on what is claimed in the record will clean up reorganization again.</text>
