            <text syncTime="19.527" offset="181478">Mr. Justice Black yesterday inquired about some insurance salesman cases in this Court and I mentioned that we had had one Metropolitan Life Insurance case not too long ago and that that case involves question of unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.853" offset="246784">Through some somewhat curious lapse of memory, Mr. Justice Black, I forgot to mention one other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.740" offset="270294">I say curious lapse of memory because I argued it and since I've lost it, that's probably why I don't want to remember it.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.678" offset="298088">But that was the insurance agent, the Prudential Insurance agent's case which is also cited -- both these cases certainly are cited in our brief and that one was on 361 477 and I'm sure Mr. Justice Brennan will recall that he wrote the opinion for the Court.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="94.673" stopTime="237.878">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="95.622" offset="485857">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.379" offset="488887">Now, in the Metropolitan Life Insurance case, that too involved debit agents and there as I said yesterday, the question was whether or not the unit which the Board had fund was inappropriate collective bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.889" offset="530892">In that case, it was conceded that they were employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.694" offset="550118">Now, in the remaining few minutes that I have, I would like to turn to my final part of my discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.593" offset="581778">Yesterday, I sought to explain that the Board's judgment that these debit agents are employees under the meaning of the Act is reasonable and wholly within the framework of the applicable governing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.900" offset="638934">We believe that the court below in displacing the Board's judgment as the status of these agents has, as I said yesterday not only misconceived the controlling test but we also think that it has overstepped the bounds of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.816" offset="698598">This Court has often said that problems of definition of status have been wisely committed by Congress to the expert agency as created and not to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.803" offset="754604">The company argues that since the controlling test here is a common law test, that the Board has no special expertise in this area and that therefore the Court of Appeals owes the Board no particular deference in applying such a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.562" offset="829628">But I suggest Your Honors that the question involved, the problem involved is not simply one of law but rather the application of a statutory term to a variety, an infinite variety of factual situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.032" offset="887515">And in that area -- in that area, it seems to us that the primary responsibility of the Board for administering the statute is singularly appropriate and this Court only recently said, “Universal Camera is not an invitation to disregard that primacy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="213.733" offset="958255">Indeed, Universal Camera says that even in areas where the Board does not possessed any special competence or expertise that the Board's choice of two fairly conflicting views is to be respected by a reviewing court even though the reviewing court, upon the de novo consideration of the matter might have fairly and reasonably come out with the adequate way, the other conclusion.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="237.878" offset="1054908">Well, Mr. Manoli, Congress certainly indicated that it wasn't satisfied with what the Board was doing with employees, he wanted to amend the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.451" offset="1105168">And yet, do you think the amendment has made any difference at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.779" offset="1122513">You apparently believed that the News Voice case is -- a result from the News Voice case isn't going to be changed under the new test and yet that's what disturbed Congress --</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="272.757" offset="1194402">Let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.708" offset="1210180">The principal criticism that both the House and the Senate had with respect to the Hearst cases as I see it, the thrust of their criticism was that they thought that this Court here had pretty much left the Board at large in determining whether or not individual for employees and for the contractors without any definite standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.491" offset="1297324">And in the House Conference Report, the Court -- it was said there, Conference Report, speaking of Hearst --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="305.884" stopTime="313.976">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="305.884" offset="1326895">So there not -- so Congress didn't want the courts to review these kinds of determinations of agencies with some care?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="313.976" stopTime="440.273">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="313.976" offset="1359287">No, I think that what they wanted to do was to make sure that the Board would be applying agency rules -- agency rules in determining the status.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.872" offset="1394813">But the fact that they adopted a common law rule doesn't mean that in the application of that rule that the Board was not to have the usual area of discretion of judgment that it ordinarily has in the application of statutory terms to particular specific situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.114" offset="1467852">Now, the -- as I say, I don't think that Universal Camera, Universal Camera as this Court said, is an invitation of the Court of Appeals to disregard that premise in the application of a specific statutory term to specific situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.000" offset="1539323">It's very much the same in the case of a supervisor to be sure that the supervisor is not a common law term but Congress in the Act has defined the various incidents that established supervisory status.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.634" offset="1585925">And repeatedly, the Courts have said that that's primarily the responsibility of the Board to apply that definition, to apply that definition to a specific situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.873" offset="1622915">And incidentally, I might mention that unlike this case here, the Seventh Circuit itself has paid that kind of difference to the Board and the application of the terms “supervisor” to a specific situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.155" offset="1672025">Now, to say the Board has no special competence in this area, I think merely overlooks what the Board does.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.187" offset="1708074">The Board has these situations almost daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.482" offset="1717269">There are a number of cases in the Boards, volumes dealing with the employees' status within the independent contractors' status, with supervisors' status, all kinds of shadings, all these various and almost infinite different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.447" offset="1773171">And it seems to me that surely, that experience makes for the kind of knowledge that in the words of this Court is entirely the usual difference by a reviewing court to the Board expertise in applying specific statutory provisions to specific situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.801" offset="1850598">Thank you.</text>

          <turn speaker="isaac_n_groner" startTime="448.840" stopTime="634.805">
            <label>Mr. Isaac N. Groner</label>
            <text syncTime="448.840" offset="1898768">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.847" offset="1914755">I think that the parties in this case have agreed as to the legal test to be applied when an issue arises under the Labor Relations Act as to whether particular workers or employees or independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.921" offset="1987062">There are two aspects to the test, two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.228" offset="2012244">One is what may be termed the general agency principle or the common law principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.615" offset="2045785">And I think that the parties have looked primarily to the restatement of the law of agency for the factors which are involved in terms of their test.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.792" offset="2090506">But the parties are agreed that that test is not the entire test.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.570" offset="2113703">There is a second test which the company, the respondent, joins the petitioners in making relevant, at least so the brief says, and that is, that there must be consideration to effectuation of the purposes of the Act to a realistic application of the common law test, so that there are two facets.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.627" offset="2209834">One is the common law or the general principles of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.470" offset="2225298">The other is the effectuation of the principles of the Act or a realistic application of the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.631" offset="2253928">Now, the first facets was added by -- was made express as a result of the congressional action or reaction to the Hearst case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.390" offset="2308890">That congressional action, we would submit, Mr. Justice White, can be summed up fairly and accurately as a feeling that both the Board and this Court in the Hearst case had given no attention whatsoever to common law principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.403" offset="2396975">Congress felt that the Board had not paid any attention to those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.759" offset="2426441">Congress read the opinion of this Court as expressly saying that common law or general principles of agency law are not to be considered but only the effectuation of the purposes of the Act, only the expertise of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.304" offset="2500629">Now, whether that reading was right or wrong is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.788" offset="2522572">What we submit and submit most emphatically is that the congressional record, the reports of the committees make very clear that this was the congressional reading so that the difference that the congressional reaction made was that the common law test had to be considered and we further submit that this is the only difference that the congressional reaction to the Hearst test makes.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.275" offset="2776482">The way that Congress reached that result was that it believed the News Voice to be independent merchants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.529" offset="4369533">And the original common law test was a test of independent calling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.918" offset="4975052">And so, whatever test is applied and there are obviously many different verbal formulations, whatever test is applied, whatever standard of judicial review is applied, the decision below cannot be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.491" offset="5049344">The decision below sweeps to one side many of the evidences of factual control, which are contained on this record with the statement that they are inherent in the insurance business or in the debit life and accident and fire insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.392" offset="5132936">Now, whether or not they are inherent in the business, we would submit it's beside the legal point of the right of control tests realistically or unrealistically applied because the right of control looks to whether or not in fact the controls may be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.152" offset="5228022">The right of control is a right of controlled tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.387" offset="5244949">If the right to control has been reserved even though it has not been exercised, that, according to the traditional formulation is enough so that those involved must be classified as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.808" offset="5298552">And to say that it is necessary in the nature of the industry because a debit insurance agent is given a collection book with a group of life and health and fire policy holders from whom he collects, so that he must perforce make many reports and must report to the office on a weekly basis because these are necessary in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.589" offset="5405759">That is obviously no reason to disregard the fact quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.037" offset="5427493">It is a compelling reason for saying that on this record in this industry, demonstration has been made, that control has been reserved and that in fact control has been exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.791" offset="5478588">The Court made much -- the court below made much of the concept that these agents were on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.524" offset="5501471">I must confess I do not know what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.318" offset="5512652">I suspect that again it is only another way of saying that the court below concluded that they were independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.393" offset="5544939">If the Court meant that they were on their own in the sense that they were on their own business enterprises, that is clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.333" offset="5584750">There is nothing on the record to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.275" offset="5596453">If the court below meant that they were “on their own” in a physical sense because it is true that most of their working time they spend out and the debit, their concentrated territory where most of their policyholder's reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.547" offset="5661550">If that is what the Court meant, again, that is not relevant legally and not supported on the record factually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.339" offset="5696763">It is not relevant legally because the right of control may be reserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.261" offset="5720377">The right of physical control may be reserved even though it is not exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.408" offset="5740962">And indeed, it is wrong factually because the record demonstrates that the right of physical control has indeed been reserved and it is being exercised on at least two different ways, One is that there is a regular meeting which all these agents must attend on a Thursday or Friday morning; they must be there, they are there and this is an occasion when supervision is physical felt, when management may physically confer with the agents and for example, tell him that he is not doing a satisfactory job and therefore must resign or should look for other employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.254" offset="5888397">Furthermore, there is physical presence felt by the accompaniment on the debit of the agent as he makes his collections and sales rounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.728" offset="6914278">It is perhaps clearer on this record that that it was on the last that the company retains and indeed has exercised the right to hire and fire these agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.208" offset="6984182">We believe that the prior record was that the case for the general counsel had more witnesses in this particular hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.744" offset="7058369">In short, the documentary evidence is more ample with respect to the rights of control retained in the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.146" offset="7091911">For example, the transfers of cases may not be made without the approval of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.143" offset="7119914">There is, for example, in this record enumeration of two or three cases where the approval was not given; thereby giving a clearer proof that the right had -- the right of control in this respect had been retained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.868" offset="7206849">The bargaining unit involved in this case is a different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.633" offset="7221896">This case involves Anne Arundel County in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.961" offset="7235166">The other case involves the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.222" offset="7248227">And there are other certain differences on the facts; some of the agents in this case came from the Quaker City Life Insurance Company and that made some difference in the record so that there are some differences with respect to the two records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.837" offset="7318758">That if -- if there are no other questions, I should like to save the balance of time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.116" offset="7375809">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.411" offset="7393050">Right here and now, I should like to sever the connection which my friends this morning have built between them and me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.955" offset="7435160">They have said, Mr. Manoli, yesterday that there is no significant dispute as to facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.443" offset="7461177">Mr. Manoli said there was no significant dispute as to the scope of review or as to the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.154" offset="7488031">And this morning, I hear from my friend, Mr. Groner that there is no significant dispute between us, as to the meaning of Congress, as to what happened to the Hearst Act, as to whether News Voice are or are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.297" offset="7556577">I suggest, Your Honor that in the words of the famous author, “Methinks my lady doth protest too loudly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.581" offset="7605687">The fact is, that of course there are very, very substantial differences between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.025" offset="7631496">The fact is, as we apprehend the law, Congress intended very specific and very positive and very definite results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.395" offset="7696906">Mr. Manoli said yesterday that in his view, the only time that the economic realities came into effect, mind with you the Hearst case, was when there was a Taft case that in the easy case you apply the law of agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.177" offset="7800038">And in the Taft case, and I quoted exactly, the policies and purposes of the statute, “tilt the scales”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.843" offset="7838699">I suggest, Your Honors, if that is true, Congress achieve nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.917" offset="7863045">Mr. Groner, this morning, said categorically, Mr. Manoli said this morning categorically that this determination is not one of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.242" offset="7904319">If that is true, Your Honors, then Senator Taft was completely in error when he defined for the Congress what the Conference Report achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.574" offset="7957713">My friends say that they have not departed from the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.752" offset="7978402">Let me read, in addition to the portion of the brief that Mr. Justice Fortas so aptly referred to, namely the footnote and other part of the brief on page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.090" offset="8023751">The determination whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor thus allows considerable room for the exercise of judgment and discretion tests which the Board, with its wide experience in handling cases, involving different hiring relationships is a specially competent to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.658" offset="8114030">Then we skip down to the middle of the page, middle of the sentence, the factors to be considered and the way to be assigned them “are so infinite and subtle that of necessity a large major of informed discretion”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.975" offset="8183306">“So infinite and subtle” instead of so simple as we were told this morning that of necessity at large and measurable of informed discretion is involved in the exercise by the Board of its primary function to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.742" offset="8250389">And then comes something, which I don't want to take time with the moment for, but the Board then says that the test -- that the Court must apply is warrant in the record and a reasonable basis in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.764" offset="8306395">That again was Hearst and that was overruled by Universal Camera but I'll come to that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.456" offset="8325204">And then I come to the footnote to which Mr. Justice Fortas referred and I see where the Board feels that where respondeat superior, which is what Congress said was to be the test, the same test that has been applied there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.670" offset="8394062">That where that is not involved, the subsequent infusion of flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.159" offset="8416005">This is something new in the law of independent contractor, the subsequent infusion of flexibility into the relevant standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.208" offset="8440247">Something else that Congress didn't intend for determining employment status is a especially appropriate where the purpose of the inquiry is not to decide the applicability of respondeat superior liability but to determine the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.860" offset="8498761">Well, that's all the Congress was dealt with if it – dealing with if it please the Court, that's the coverage of the National Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.383" offset="8524884">Now, let me just read to Your Honors, if I may, and I have not intended to take your time with this, two excerpts, One from the House Committee Report which originated the language and the other from Senator Taft in explaining to the Senate why he recommended that they adopt the Conference Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.414" offset="8605027">The House Report says, “An employee, according to all standard dictionaries, according to the law as the Court have stated, and according to the understanding of almost everyone, with the exception of the National Labor Relations Board means “someone who works for another for hire.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.822" offset="8674617">But in the case of NLRB against Hearst, the Board expanded the term “employee” beyond anything it ever had included before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.356" offset="8708786">And the Supreme Court, relying on the theoretic expertness of the Board, upheld the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.420" offset="8741073">It is inconceivable that Congress, when it passed the Act, authorized the Board to give to every word in the Act whatever meaning it wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.458" offset="8773256">On the contrary, Congress intended then and it intends now that the Board gives to words not farfetched meanings but ordinary measures, ordinary meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.897" offset="8814947">To correct what the Board has done and what the Supreme Court putting misplaced reliance upon the Board's expertness has approved the bill excludes independent contract and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.206" offset="8868237">And what does Mr. Senator Taft do to my friend's argument that this is not a question of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.942" offset="8899166">“The legal effect of the amendment therefore” he says, that the Congress, in presenting the Conference Report, necessary an official position, “is merely to make it clear that the question whether or not a person is an employee is always a question of law, always a question of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.580" offset="8965726">Since the term is not meant to embrace persons outside that category under the general principles of the law of agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2362.499" offset="9553377">We say that while the framework is the Act, the controlling principle must be agency law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.136" offset="9575946">Certainly, that's what we intended to say, that's what we thought we said that we didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.804" offset="9590575">It isn't what we intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.683" offset="9598098">Now, I address myself to a question, several questions that Mr. Justice White asked and that is what the Senate thought as to the specific issue of this case, namely the Newspaper Drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.242" offset="9668315">I may say that in the back of our brief as appendix A, we have drawn three columns, four columns really.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.133" offset="9699871">The first are the items that were considered by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.819" offset="9718680">The second contains the items which the courts have felt important as to United's agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.906" offset="9746996">But, of course, we say that there is no generic debit agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.292" offset="9768521">There are certain things they have in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.743" offset="9778343">There are great many things they have different from each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.797" offset="9790568">The third contains interestingly enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.634" offset="9801958">The items in the Phoenix Mutual case where the court below held that debit agents were not independent contractors but were employees because they operated differently from United's employees and the Court showed the difference between those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.627" offset="9869876">And the last column shows what's in the Hearst case the Court defined as the controls and lack of controls over the News Voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.117" offset="9911881">Now, Mr. Justice White, what the Court -- what the Congress said about the Hearst and then specifically about these rather petty types of employees as the Board regarded them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.863" offset="9998817">In the first place, the House Conference Report said it is believed that the provisions of the Conference Agreement relating to the Court's reviewing power will be adequate to preclude such decisions as those in Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.537" offset="10073527">Now, I don't know what precluding a decision like the one in Hearst can mean except precluding the holding of those News Voice to be employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.385" offset="10116890">And then I go to a portion of Senator Taft's statement and he said specifically, “While the Board has never claimed that independent contractors were employees, the Supreme Court has the Hearst Publication's case held that the ordinary test of the law of agency could be disregarded by the Board in determining if petty occupational groups were employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.254" offset="10232351">That's very much like Mr. Manoli, in reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.547" offset="10245517">Mr. Manoli says that where it's a clear case and that he very clearly says as these petty occupational groups in effect, the Board's view has become today as I shall show that you've got to be an independent businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.276" offset="10304449">That if it's the type of thing that some people had employees and some have independent contractors that has fled from the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.239" offset="10332348">That's not what the Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.195" offset="10340185">The Congress said that, if petty groups were employees within the meaning of the Labors Relations Act, the Court consequently refused to consider the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.728" offset="10386265">The legal effect of the amendment, therefore, is to make clear and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.709" offset="10402252">So that I would say categorically, Mr. Justice White, that rightly or wrongly, the Congress in an issue which is not constitutional in character but merely involves what it wants words to mean, obviously, it could use any word and define as it pleases and this Court, I respectfully submit, is bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.160" offset="10492008">The Congress in an issue not involving constitutional questions has said, the Court has played mistaken, has paid mistaken difference to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.955" offset="10527222">This is a question where the Court's expertise, where the long list of cases to which Mr. Justice Black referred, whatever may have been the issues in those cases have established the law of independent agency, you cannot say that economic realities make it so that if there's a right of termination, if the status is not a lofty status, if it's not an independent business, will no longer regard it as an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.777" offset="10638503">And I can see the reason why the Board says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.965" offset="10647280">The Board says that because its function is to extend coverage, to extend coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.497" offset="10669328">Congress has said, it extended it too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.723" offset="10678314">Now, we are going to put a stop in this one respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.916" offset="10975065">Yes, and, Your Honor, if you will look at this tabulation we've shown, you will find fewer controls in the debit agent case than were present in the News Voice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.868" offset="11026892">Now, I address myself factually to a statement by Mr. Manoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.315" offset="11052596">He says there is, and I quote him exactly, he said yesterday, “There is really no significant dispute as to the basic facts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.386" offset="11092929">And that is what the brief says for the Government, for the Board that is what the union brief says and interestingly enough, that is what the trial examiners introduced the statement said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.758" offset="11130441">If so, Your Honors, my task would be an easy one because under the test I have just shown, this Court would be the expert agency to apply the various factors of traditional independent agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.049" offset="11199613">But I fear that if we argued the case on the basis of their being no significant dispute, Your Honors, when you reread the briefs, would find that it would be like Hans Christian Andersen's famous “The Emperor's New Clothes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.547" offset="11257605">You would find that it was all a mirage because the simple fact is that they're very substantial disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.237" offset="11296371">I was rather surprised to hear my friend, Mr. Groner, and I'm sure it was an inadvertence, say in reply to Mr. Justice Fortas that one of the differences between this case and the other cases was that this case the Board offered more witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.534" offset="11353527">The Board had one significant witness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.772" offset="11366484">You couldn't have less than that and it had one witness to corroborate on transfers, very brief witness who told very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.863" offset="11402846">And that was the total Board's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.868" offset="11410892">There wasn't one other solitary thing type of testimony in the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.361" offset="11432835">So, Mr. Groner's recollection obviously is at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.130" offset="11451852">Now, Your Honors, I'd like to talk just a minute about what debit agents do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.846" offset="11474735">If they are such simple focus, Mr. Manoli described to Your Honors, if their total time is simply devoted to knocking at the door in saying “your premium is due, please pay it”, why does the brief of the Government spend more than 50% on the facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.781" offset="11550490">And why does the union brief takes 44 pages to do nothing but state the facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.556" offset="11577553">It's because it is not an uncomplicated job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.003" offset="11591346">Mr. Manoli's deprecatory references to the debit agents activities calls for a very brief statement of what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.071" offset="11631679">I take it that every one would agree that United had the right to parcel out this phase of its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.825" offset="11658637">Business can parcel out anything that it wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.390" offset="11672952">It could have parceled out its advertising; it could parcel out its accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.406" offset="11689044">It shows to parcel out three phases of its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.935" offset="11707120">One is the collecting, it is true, another is the selling, and the third is the servicing of its policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.438" offset="11741080">I'd like to tell Your Honors, that a third of the income of these people comes from not from collections, but from the new business they write.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.689" offset="11770128">And I might say as this record shows one-third to 40% of their time spent on activities other than collecting, selling, servicing of policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.709" offset="11826239">But don't let me deprecate selling, Your Honors, it's not a routine job to collect premiums on insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.386" offset="11864900">Each collection in the first place is the reselling job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.615" offset="11877857">These are simple folk that buy industrial insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.881" offset="11898859">They have to be resold each time you collect the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.260" offset="11912443">I may say competition is very keen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.785" offset="11922474">It's a good deal of endeavor to try to change these people especially early in the policy where there's no loss to other policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.682" offset="11966151">The scheduling in a wide territory is difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.029" offset="11983496">He must learn the habits of each client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.957" offset="11991228">He must learn the best time to collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.755" offset="11998438">He must learn about the man who when he gets his pay on Friday, no longer has it on Sunday night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.605" offset="12025814">He's going to get there Friday before it goes to the corner cup brew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.760" offset="12038457">He's got to know about the housewife who will spend her allowance Monday.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.053" offset="12075551">He's got to know that the man who works, for example, on a contracting job in Montana may have months without work and he's got to try to persuade that man to pay in advance three or four months premiums so the policy won't lapse during the time that the snows are on the ground and no construction is going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3913.098" offset="15755786">That's one of the differences that in the Phoenix case they were employees and they had a work at certain number of hours and they had to respect their hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.192" offset="15784103">Whereas here, admittedly, they are on their own and the -- it is made very clearer indeed that these agents have no restrictions at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3944.322" offset="15880652">Obviously, they got to report back was then policies are assured on them within the next couple of weeks and every other phase, it's in the record and it's a one-page report, and it's their own computation of their own commissions because this money though trust funds in the hands of an insurance agent, a general insurance agent, are not trust funds in their hands.</text>

            <text syncTime="4695.291" offset="18884524">He then said that it was too in extent and he then said they have to work day and night anyway, that it's all around the clock job which of course, it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.461" offset="18917230">The testimony here is at 20 hours to 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.602" offset="18929768">But there is -- and the testimony of the witnesses for the company here was virtually identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.299" offset="18960593">It happens the same lawyer tried the cases, it happened to be my brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.569" offset="18981700">It happens that the same attorney from the company was assigned to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.440" offset="19009181">They operate uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.899" offset="19019003">There is a big difference and this difference is Franklin Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.500" offset="19033422">This company had taken over Quaker and incidentally, it's interesting that my friends do not even refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.715" offset="19058186">The company took over the Quaker City Life Insurance Company, which was a company whose debit agents were clearly employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.188" offset="19096116">They exercise all controls, they required the reports that were present in Phoenix Life and that we‘ve outlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.293" offset="19124537">A man named Scott, by the examiner's definition, became the ring leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.107" offset="19155780">The examiner said that Mr. Scott was obviously partisan, was obviously endeavoring to further the General Counsel's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.085" offset="19199666">But he believed Scott explicitly and every single word he said and most of his words were different from both Board witnesses and employee and employer witnesses or company witnesses in the last case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.802" offset="19258598">Now, he was at Franklin Street and all of the former agents of the Quaker City Life were at Franklin Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.584" offset="19289736">And curiously, this one witness that the Board produced and the witness who substantiated him as to these transfers both came from Franklin Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.158" offset="19327979">Admittedly, they knew nothing about St.Paul Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.070" offset="19343653">We put on the assistant manager we had at Franklin Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.986" offset="19363297">Obviously, these fellows were formed as a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.232" offset="19376253">They were filing written demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.188" offset="19384090">They were endeavoring to frustrate the endeavor to make them independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.335" offset="19404675">Now, here were our witnesses, all of them were from St. Paul Street, which had been our traditional office there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.258" offset="19432364">Both are covered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.174" offset="19436022">There were 80 agents there in 79.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.871" offset="19446888">And this examined, without a word of testimony by a Board witness what went on to St. Paul Street simply said everything Scott said applied to St. Paul Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.146" offset="19495999">Now, I submit to Your Honors that no court could sustain that and this Court didn't sustain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.607" offset="19525778">Now, the examiner tried to get around that by saying, “No, but that only went on for two weeks in March and it was all over by then.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.130" offset="19559842">But this record has letters in June and in September and it has the testimony of Mr. Forwaldt, the assistant manager who said things were chaotic in December at that time of the hearing.This was an aberration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.080" offset="19615744">This was sui generis at this one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.918" offset="19627029">And I suggest to Your Honors, that the examiner, in trying to gloss it over as a part of a kind of absolute policy that he was going to write the one -- he was going to write the one report decision that couldn't be reversed by a Court, differed from all of his predecessors in the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.985" offset="19707277">There's been one sense and we cite the case in the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.357" offset="19728802">I'm going to send the clerk the citation because it will show, Your Honors, how the same agents have been treated as if they were different breeds of animals in the four other trial examiners versus this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.720" offset="19786271">Now, this examiner did a remarkable thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.175" offset="19804035">The Court said that it seriously influenced the Court and yet, Your Honors, Mr. Manoli didn't refer to it this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.359" offset="19852831">Mr. Groner didn't refer to it this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.473" offset="19865266">The Board brief relegates it to the very last footnote on the very last page and the union does the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.610" offset="19905808">And this was something which the court below simply could not accept.</text>

            <text syncTime="4962.681" offset="19954082">The court below said that there was not, from its examination of the records, substantial evidence for critical facts and there were at best what it called tenuous support for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.943" offset="20007163">It said that critical findings had infirmities from the standpoint of lack of substantial evidence we support and it gave the test of Universal Camera and said it could not conscientiously rely on this examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.707" offset="20058154">Now, then it gave this story, it said, “Why is it that this examiner believed one witness, who admittedly know only about Franklin Street and disbelieved all the others who testified about a wholly different location?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.713" offset="20142268">And he said “that he was undoubtedly influenced by the fact that he said as he observed these not witnesses but debit agents, both those who testified and those who didn't in the courtroom, he called it on and off the stand demeanor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.741" offset="20226382">As he observed their demeanor, they showed -- I'd like to read that to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.885" offset="20274866">“They showed a servile attitude.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.254" offset="20292420">They showed something -- let just if I may read that to Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="5065.056" offset="20363577">“They showed a marked deference beyond the sometimes illusive requirements of courtesy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.237" offset="20396283">He said that “They failed to show in their off the stand and on the stand attitude, a demeanor of independence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.675" offset="20438079">And he said, “Typical of what happened, his attitude was when there was stipulated that six witnesses, six debit agents wouldn't testify, they just identified themselves and the testimony would be the same as the other”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.549" offset="20493563">He said, “While being deprived of their ‘moments of the glory'”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.831" offset="20510699">And this was his all attitude towards these debit agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="5165.230" offset="20764296">Now, Your Honor, in the first place, by saying they don't agree with the observation in the footnote, I don't know whether they mean they don't agree with the “finding”, so label the finding by the examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.279" offset="20816436">But it isn't just the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.364" offset="20824795">The text says that, “As he observed the debit agents in eight days of hearings,” well, our people run stand only five days, so his textual reference has to be off the stand as well and he says that, his observation, he is using that support for “my findings”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.231" offset="20924270">And I submit, that the Court then said, “We can't do that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.806" offset="20942555">The whole thing is tainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.952" offset="20951228">This whole attitude, the reason he had said these people are unworthy of belief is because they are saying things which label them as independent contractors and his view is, that they're servile, that they don't show ordinary independence as they walk around the courtroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="5396.653" offset="21689971">Well, this Court said on that point unanimously in Universal Camera and in Pittsburg Steamship that that is no longer the test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Isaac N. Groner</label>
            <text syncTime="5479.231" offset="22020263">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.456" offset="22033220">The first answer I will give Your Honor, is that the Board expressly disavowed any reliance on the off the stand demeanor testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.619" offset="22089853">So that what was before the Court was the Board order?</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.912" offset="22111065">So that even though the Board had adopted the short form order, which in effect adopted the findings and decision of the trial examiner, they dropped the footnote, indeed, from the record to form to call special attention to it and to say we disavow any reliance upon the comment by the trial examiner with respect to off stand demeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.147" offset="22199986">That is my first answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.294" offset="22204583">My second answer is that any fair reading of the trial examiner's decision will demonstrate that this is pure dictum, that he said it was pure dictum and that the entire elevation of this issue by the court below and by the respondent is merely, and I regret to say it but it is our view that it is merely one way of attempting to mask the overwhelming facts of this record demonstrating that these agents are employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.062" offset="22335613">The trial examiner's decision is a long and a careful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.933" offset="22355153">If you open it to any page, it relies as much upon witnesses called by the respondent, Vice President Ross, Division Manager Forwaldt, the agents from St. Paul Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.838" offset="22410742">It is simply not true that the examiner found that all the testimony called by the respondent was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.901" offset="22447000">If you read the examiner's decision, you will find that he weighed all the evidence and that he doesn't give -- he does indeed give credence to many of the statements by the respondent's witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.577" offset="22493706">Many of the facts which Mr. Segal has said it have admittedly so and did are not admittedly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.896" offset="22522964">For example, on Page 222 of the record, the question is, “Do you think it is against the rules for you to get someone to collect for you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.521" offset="22557445">Answer, “If I may you asked me, if I thought it was against the rules to have an outsider and that's the term you used, do my work for me and I said yes and I still say yes that I consider it a violation of the rules.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.137" offset="22619930">Now, Mr. Segal said admittedly there were no individual meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.311" offset="22636648">On page 632 of the record, the question is, “Was Mr. Gore asked to come in on a day other than his regular reporting day?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.331" offset="22676668">The witness, respondent's witness, William H. Forwaldt answer, “Yes, he was”, page 632 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.318" offset="22708642">Mr. Segal states that the headquarters of these agents are in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="5655.354" offset="22724838">If you look them up in the phonebook, you would find the address and the telephone number of that district office of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.986" offset="22755349">These employees are part and parcel of the hierarchy and organization of the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="5677.268" offset="22812400">The products which they sell are the respondent's products.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.768" offset="22826402">The headquarters which they use is the respondent's headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.954" offset="22843225">The very purpose of the district office testified to by witnesses called by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.657" offset="22866004">The very purpose of the district office is because the respondent has decided that that is the best manner on means it has selected for carrying on its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.759" offset="22910412">So that the business we are dealing with as the organization that we are dealing with is the business and organization of the respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="5727.144" offset="23011976">They have no genuine bargaining power vis-à-vis the respondent.</text>
