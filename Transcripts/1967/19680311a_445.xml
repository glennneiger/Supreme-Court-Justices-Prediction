            <text syncTime="30.919" offset="227035">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.210" offset="240201">This case presents the two questions that were reserved by this Court in footnote 8 of the Dowd Box decision, is a suit filed in state court to enjoin a strike in breach of contract now removable, and due to restraints of Norris-LaGuardia, now applied to state courts as well as to federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.493" offset="341347">This petitioner operates a defense plant at Nashville, Tennessee and they make in that plant components for airplanes used by the defense forces of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.381" offset="392861">There are about 2000 employees in the bargaining unit, and these employees are represented by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.859" offset="426820">The petitioner has a contract with the respondents, a three-year contract which contains a categorical unconditioned no strike clause effective for the duration to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.599" offset="477811">Also it has the quid pro quo, it has a grievance procedure terminating in binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.214" offset="516263">In the summer of 1965, shortly after this contract was executed, members of the bargaining unit covered by the contract including local union officials commenced a series of work stoppages and interruptions of work in this defense plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.001" offset="595362">The first stoppage occurred on July 29, 1965 in one department and lasted for a short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.589" offset="633710">Thereafter, from time to time work stoppages occurred in other departments of the plant, one department after another, interruptions that bottlenecked production in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.372" offset="692851">Finally, on October 14, 1965 a picket line was placed in front of the whole plant, and the on the following morning the morning of October 15, after this sort of interference had been going on for two and a half months the whole plant was finally shut down by a massive picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.215" offset="780204">Not until then did this petitioner seek injunctive relief and on October 15 they went into the Chancery Court, Davidson County, Tennessee and it filed its Bill of complaint seeking a temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.870" offset="846869">The court granted the injunction, people went back to work and the respondents did nothing for another 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.554" offset="877589">At that time they filed their petition to remove this case to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.390" offset="900890">Subsequently, about a week later they moved to dissolve the state court injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.312" offset="920639">Of course we filed our petition to remand pointing out to the district judge that we had filed our case under Tennessee law.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.358" offset="964838">We had not alleged federal law, we had not intended to invoke federal law, but Tennessee law.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.973" offset="983228">Nevertheless, the district judge after considering the matter for several months denied our application to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.880" offset="1018859">He dissolved the state court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.625" offset="1297847">No, no Your Honor, this was a peaceful stoppage and we allege no violation of law in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.415" offset="1333060">We simply allege breach of contract and we allege in the body of the petition that the -- that we were entitled to injunctive relief under the equity practice of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.593" offset="1377782">Now in order to -- well this -- I might add that the district judge told you his action and then the case went to the Sixth Circuit and they affirmed the action of the district judge in their opinion they stated that attempting to follow the mandate of this Court in Lincoln Mills and the reasoning of this Court in Lincoln Mills, they said that in enacting Section 301, Congress had preempted, totally preempted the field of breach contract, the contract violation and that therefore our suit necessarily arose under the laws of the United States, and that the District Court had jurisdiction of the cause even though because of the restraints of Norris-LaGuardia, it couldn't grant us the relief that we sought, and the only relief that we sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.751" offset="1582373">Now in order to understand this case and arrive at a correct decision, I respectfully submit, we must first throw our minds to the Spring of 1947 immediately before Congress enacted the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.286" offset="1644544">And at that time it is undisputed first of all that state courts of equity could enjoin strikes in breach of contract that they were doing it in many states.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.807" offset="1694595">That Congress knew this and that such proceedings were not removable under 1441 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="406.504" offset="1729390">Also it is undisputed that at that time the restraints of Norris-LaGuardia did not apply to state courts or their injunctive orders that's where we start.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.183" offset="1776097">And so the only remaining question is whether Congress in enacting 301 intended to change any of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.606" offset="1813817">And we respectfully submit that the evidence is overwhelming, the legislative history is overwhelming, that Congress had no intention to change any of those three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.362" offset="1856867">They had no intention to stop state courts from enjoining strikes in breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.962" offset="1879228">They had no intention to make such proceedings removable under 1441 (b) or anything else and they had no intention to extend the restraints of Norris-LaGuardia to these state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.361" offset="1928861">In fact the intention of Congress was precisely the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.114" offset="1947878">Congress intended that these state court remedies would continue to operate and they simply supplemented the existing state court remedies with one more remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.722" offset="1998242">Now why did they do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="475.326" offset="2004720">They did it because the legislative history shows that Congress was concerned in 1947, with seeing these agreements enforced and they were concerned by evidence in legislative hearings that there were gaps in the law of many states because of the diversity problem and -- the problem are not diversity, but the problem of being unable to sue unions as an additive.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.835" offset="2106702">The fact that you had to sue everybody in an unincorporated association and for other reasons there were gaps in the enforcement of these contracts among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.034" offset="2147558">And Congress wanted to assure that there'd be at least one remedy in every state available to employers and the unions for the enforcement of these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.782" offset="2186533">So they overlaid an additional remedy, but they did not disturb the existing or intend to disturb the existing the state court procedures and remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.383" offset="2232926">Now this is clear I think from the previous decisions of this Court based on this legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.919" offset="2259048">This Court for example held in Dowd and stated in Dowd that Congress manifested its complete awareness of both the existence and the limitations of state court remedies for violation of collective agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.087" offset="2311711">They knew all about what was going on in the states, they knew they were enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.079" offset="2327698">Senator Taft himself said on the floor of the Senate in the argument that “I want to point out that there is no law against courts issuing injunctions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="565.847" offset="2366777">Of course a court may always issue an injunction in connection with the lawsuit except as limited by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and of course that limitation at that time applied only to federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.833" offset="2414738">So they knew about the injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.306" offset="2424560">Now what was their intention?</text>
            <text syncTime="582.112" offset="2431770">This Court has stated in Dowd reviewing the legislative history that the purpose of Congress was not to limit, but to expand to the availability of forums for the enforcement of contracts made by labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.265" offset="2488404">The court stated in Hughes v. Cardinal that the purpose of conferring jurisdiction under federal courts was not to displace but to supplement the thoroughly considered jurisdiction of the courts of the various states over contracts made by labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.157" offset="2559979">And subsequently in again in Dowd, the court said in enacting Section 301 Congress did not intend to deprive a party to a collective bargaining contract of the right to seek redress of its violation in an appropriate state tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.559" offset="2625599">They said that they did not intend to take away any jurisdiction of the state courts, did not intend to encroach in any way on the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.043" offset="2659558">This is the finding of this Court and it's based on undisputed legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.217" offset="2680247">So we must conclude that the intention of Congress was to leave the existing state remedies in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.307" offset="2776586">Congress did enact Section 301 and it said that suits for violation of labor context may, maybe filed in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.464" offset="2821204">And this Court has held in a series of decisions that by this language, Congress did intend to create a substantive body of law to be enforced as a federal right and not simply a creation of a forum to enforce state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.515" offset="2889435">There's no question about that Your Honor, but -- and this Court has further held that in fashioning the law to be applied in federal court or under 301 procedures, this Court will fashion a law and you will adopt law that is not incompatible, state court rules that are not incompatible with national policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.639" offset="4465977">Now we contend that if the Lucas and Dowd and Hughes v. Cardinal mean what they say, and incidentally in Hughes v. Cardinal by substantive this Court made a definition and the definition was that something is substantive within this preemptive concept only if it affects the formation of a contract with a private settlement of disputes under that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.412" offset="4556988">Anything outside that area is not preempted that's why I read these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.086" offset="4575692">Now, here a contract had been formed so Tennessee law didn't affect in any way the formation of the contract, and the private settlement of disputes as set up in that contract had broken down just as they had in Hughes v. Cardinal, because we're in court, they are obviously broken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.073" offset="4639640">Now the minute we get into that area of remedy, this is an area that is not been preempted and therefore the state remedy would remain in effect just as the state statute of limitations was recognized as effective in Dowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.984" offset="4695333">Now it's true that in Dowd, the suit was initiated in the -- I mean in Hughes v. Cardinal, the suit was initiated in the federal court so you had no removal problem there and naturally if the suit is brought in federal court it can only be brought under 301 only under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.015" offset="4779447">You have indicated your election by filing this suit in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.662" offset="4798046">Now there's one more point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.062" offset="4803584">As Your Honors have suggested, even if you do -- you think that no state law now exists, surely we were entitled to allege the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.634" offset="4857919">We didn't attempt or purport to allege a federal suit, and so it wouldn't be removable if we were wrong and alleged only a state cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.434" offset="4901073">That wouldn't make it removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.496" offset="4909328">We can't be compelled to seek a federal remedy if we don't want one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.983" offset="4927300">Now, however even if federal law, as we pointed out in our brief, even if federal law is considered as preempting the whole substantive field, it still would not be removable because even if the Tennessee court was being asked by us, as it wasn't to apply federal law, this was not a law arising under laws of the United States because it was fashioned law, fashioned by the federal courts and adapted from the states and so it was created by the states and not the courts and not Congress and it would not arise under federal in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.396" offset="5104933">That is our contention as set forth in great detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.099" offset="5119770">Now, there's a second facet to this and I just want to allude to this briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.184" offset="5140146">In Sinclair this Court has held that Congress in enacting 301 simply intended to leave Norris-LaGuardia the way it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.818" offset="5186644">And it didn't intend to make any exemptions to it, just continue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.005" offset="5207437">Well, the way it was, it didn't apply to state court injunction proceedings, and we contend therefore that a federal court does not have jurisdiction, original jurisdiction over a suit to enjoin a strike in breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.734" offset="5290297">Norris-LaGuardia of course was enacted back in 1932 before the merger of law in equity in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.788" offset="5326555">At that time we had an equity side and a law side, and these injunction suits had to be brought under the equity side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.108" offset="5355813">So Congress was concerned obviously only with withdrawing jurisdiction from the equity side of the court and any reference to equity in the legislative history arose from this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.226" offset="5408266">But Congress did use the big word jurisdiction because as this Court said in Sinclair they wanted to use the biggest possible language in order to block any possibility of misconstruction or a narrowing construction by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.200" offset="5476185">They wanted to take jurisdiction away from federal courts to issue injunctions in labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.332" offset="5500740">We say they did, and take the jurisdiction away and if that is true, then such a suit would not be removable under 1441 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.548" offset="6541563">An employer claims that during the term of a collective bargaining agreement, a strike takes place in violation of the no strike commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.890" offset="6582941">Based on that claim of contract violation, he brings a suit in a state court and requests a strike injunction as relief for the contract violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.464" offset="6629230">The union removes that action from the state court to the federal court and our only question is whether that action is properly removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.046" offset="6675519">Now that action is properly removed if two requirements of removal are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.992" offset="6699342">One, the action must be within the original jurisdiction of a federal court, and two, the action must be founded on a claim or right arising under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.830" offset="6754722">Now with respect to the requirement, the arising under requirement, a -- when you have a collective bargaining agreement in an industry affecting interstate commerce that an action for violation of that agreement must rest on Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.234" offset="6840299">There is no other law on which that action can be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.194" offset="6860152">There is no law, but federal law which can be invoked with respect to a claimed breach of a collective bargaining agreement in an industry affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.454" offset="6905187">And that is true even if we were to assume that a state court, if the action stayed in the state court would have the authority to issue a strike injunction, because the state court on that hypothesis would have authority to issue a strike injunction only because the federal law said it had that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.916" offset="6999019">Whether or not the state court can issue a strike injunction is a question of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.171" offset="7024097">So which ever way this action is sliced, it can only arise under our law -- under a -- it can only arise under a law of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1791.449" offset="7269125">We would certainly would have claimed that federal law precludes a state from issuing a strike injunction in a suit under a collective bargaining agreement, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.929" offset="7307055">Now the other question necessary to removal requirement we must satisfy is that the action be within the original jurisdiction of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.881" offset="7354911">Now with respect to the original jurisdiction of a federal court, we have I think a very plain setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.510" offset="7389393">A federal court has the power decide contract claims, violations, alleged violations of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.509" offset="7433383">A federal court, if it defines that there has been a contract violation is empowered as the, whatever if that is the appropriate remedy to compel arbitration, to confirm or vacate an arbitration award, to render a money judgment, to render a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.223" offset="7516244">The one thing it may not do by reason of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is to issue a strike injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.417" offset="7549053">And our sole question therefore with respect to the requirement of original jurisdiction is whether the lack of authority of a federal court to issue a strike injunction is a divestiture of subject matter jurisdiction or is a limitation of equity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.423" offset="7625017">If it is solely a limitation of equity jurisdiction that is not the kind of lack original jurisdiction of which the removal statute speaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.826" offset="7662634">If it's a limitation of subject matter jurisdiction then we cannot remove this type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.515" offset="7693458">Now the Norris-LaGuardia Act aside, it is crystal clear that a limitation upon the power of a federal court or the authority of a federal court to issue an injunction is -- does not go to the subject matter jurisdiction of a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.200" offset="7772139">It goes to equity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.029" offset="7779453">It goes to the merits of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.949" offset="7791156">If that is correct, then what we need to ask ourselves is, does the Norris-LaGuardia Act itself make an alteration in that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.563" offset="7829608">And the sole basis upon which it can be said that the Norris-LaGuardia Act itself relates to subject matter jurisdiction rather than equity jurisdiction, it is because the Norris-LaGuardia Act talks in the language of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.542" offset="7897527">But the talk in the Norris-LaGuardia Act in the language jurisdiction is just as fully explicable as a reference to equity jurisdiction and much more clearly a reference to equity jurisdiction than to subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.123" offset="7959907">Every place in the Norris-LaGuardia Act that the word jurisdiction is used, one can insert equity jurisdiction and make no slightest alteration in the sense of the Congress in enacting the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.413" offset="8012988">Let's take a look the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.109" offset="8023855">The Norris-LaGuardia Act does not say that a federal court is not empowered to adjudicate controversies arising out of or involving labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.303" offset="8072547">What it says is that you have such a controversy, therefore a federal court you can not get injunctive relief unless you satisfy certain prerequisites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.715" offset="8122284">This statute, the Norris-LaGuardia Act begins with a public policy which expresses national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.549" offset="8153527">It was enacted in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.235" offset="8164289">In 1935 in the National Labor Relations Act, the same virtually in so many words, the same national labor policy expressed in the Norris-LaGuardia Act was expressed in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.606" offset="8221759">We therefore deal with a statute which is (Inaudible) on Congress' recognition in its view of what was important to national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.354" offset="8260838">This statute has substantive import.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.846" offset="8274735">On its face, it outlaws the “yellow dog contract”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.451" offset="8289155">On its face it prescribes rules with respect to vicarious responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.509" offset="8313396">It has requirements which are -- which pertain to traditional equity practice, the requirement of substantial irreparable injury, the requirement of no adequate remedy at law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.746" offset="8498343">So it seems to us that the entirety of the Norris-LaGuardia Act necessarily speaks not of a divestiture of the power of the court to deal with the controversy but a circumscription of the manner in which it will exercise that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.022" offset="8559470">Now we didn't invent this distinction between equity jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction, and we didn't invent its application to the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.411" offset="8601057">Throughout the passage, the deliberations in Congress which preceded the enactment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the legislative refrain was, we are dealing with the equity jurisdiction of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.252" offset="8656332">For example on page 33 of our brief, Congressman Bank (ph) speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.239" offset="8680364">He says of the Bill which became the Norris-LaGuardia Act “It does not undertake to withdraw from the federal judiciary, any of its functions in equity, but it nearly imposes conditions upon them and restraints upon them with reference to the issuance of injunctions and labor disputes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.072" offset="8759672">And in the House Bill, there was attached a memorandum by then Professor Felix Frankfurter which described in detail the constitutional power that Congress would be exercising in the enactment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and in that memorandum then Professor Frankfurter said “The Congress would be exercising its power over equity jurisdiction of the federal courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.208" offset="8856221">And this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Bakery Drivers Workers Union v. Wagshal said “The question is whether the complaint subjects the Court to the limitations imposed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act upon its equity jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.368" offset="8924871">We think therefore that clearly this action meets the two requirements for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.774" offset="8950471">One that the action arise under a law of the United States, there is no other under which it can arise in this case and two that it be within the original jurisdiction of the federal court because the only limitation in this case pertains to the equity jurisdiction and that is not a requirement which goes to original jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.946" offset="13487208">I would suppose, realistically, that these actions are going to be removed by any lawyer who's informed on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.323" offset="13524616">Now what we do suggest however with respect to the competing considerations as to whether their strike injunction is desirable or is undesirable, when you get all through with marshaling them, I think you come out with the question for the people across the street and a question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.558" offset="13593579">That was true when Sinclair was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.269" offset="13604446">I think it is even more true five and a half years from Sinclair there has been no action by Congress on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.217" offset="13632240">There have been a couple of Bills introduced and nothing has been done, and we think therefore it might be just as well to embrace what seems to be the congressional judgment to leave well enough alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.165" offset="13684067">Central Airlines relied on with the respondents turned solely on the intention of Congress, and this Court held that Congress intended there to establish an exclusive remedy, but here Congress didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.906" offset="13734954">And let me draw your attention very briefly to the legislative history once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.581" offset="13753657">In 1947, the House passed a Bill that provided for enforcement in Federal District Courts of suits for violation of labor contracts, and also contained a specific exception to Norris-LaGuardia to cover those suits in federal suits and that was the Bill as it passed the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.363" offset="13832861">In the Senate, they also provided for injunctive relief on the original Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.354" offset="13852818">They provided a suit in federal courts and they also provided a -- that there would be a -- to become an unfair labor practice which would bring it under Section 10 (j) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.255" offset="13904436">So both Bills originally had facility to enjoin a strike against breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.782" offset="13930454">They'd said it to the committee and the committee came up with a compromise and they decided to drop the exception to Norris-LaGuardia out of the House Bill, and to drop the unfair labor practice out of the said Bill on the representation that they were going to leave the enforcement of these contracts to the usual processes of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.900" offset="14011016">Now those usual processes were state court injunctions as well as state court damage suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.141" offset="14035884">And so they created an additional, they supplemented it and that was the intention that Congress, and the congressmen would have put an exception to Norris-LaGuardia in this Bill, but for that representation and that compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.761" offset="14090428">So what the respondents are asking us to do here today is to frustrate the clearly expressed and agreed intention of Congress, and I'm confident that the Court will not do that.</text>
