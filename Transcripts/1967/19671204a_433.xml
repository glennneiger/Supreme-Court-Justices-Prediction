            <label>Mr. Howard J. Trienens</label>
            <text syncTime="45.792" offset="286490">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.849" offset="298820">I've been assigned 50 minutes and I hope to save a few moments for reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.126" offset="319927">Last term, the Court held the Penn-Central merger should not be consummated until the ultimate thing, the three railroads had -- have been determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.041" offset="359528">The Court stated that this meant a decision on the inclusion of these three railroads in a major system prior to the consummation of Penn-Central merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.240" offset="400384">But the underlying reason for that holding was the economic fact that Penn-Central merger will destroy three other railroads, the Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware &amp; Hudson, Boston &amp; Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.143" offset="447927">The Commission expressly found that this would happen and since the case was before this Court, that finding has not been modified and has not been challenged by any party.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.866" offset="494843">Now, the Commission has held that Penn-Central can be consummated and why, because the Commission has issued an order in the N &amp; W Inclusion Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.919" offset="535071">The Commission's order directs Norfolk &amp; Western to pay out some $130 million in stock and cash to acquire the equity ownership, not the properties but the equity ownership of these three railroads and to include them as separate subsidiary corporations in the N &amp; W system.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.978" offset="619290">Now the reason for the form of this order, I'm giving Erie as an example, is that N &amp; W is required to buy the stock of Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.520" offset="661504">It's not merged and it's not integrated completely because merger was out of the question.As the Commission found, merger was nowhere in sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.881" offset="698911">The reason it's nowhere in sight is that Erie had $350 million of debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.552" offset="717615">Everybody recognized that that made merger out of question, and the reason of course was that Erie bondholders who are appellants in this Court refused to do anything to modify that bond for that debt and they said they'd rather have Erie go bankrupt than modify the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.439" offset="785115">And so, we have these corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.498" offset="797341">N &amp; W acquires their stock by going into N &amp; W Subsidiary Corporation, separate corporations and if they fail to meet their fixed charges individually, they can go into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.248" offset="848332">It's essential to us -- compare what this order does for Erie stockholders but what it does for the Erie Corporation upon whom the Commission relies to provide necessary transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.095" offset="899741">Now why is it that N &amp; W is required to buy the stock of Erie for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.009" offset="923460">Here is the public interest finding and I think it's critical to read this because the District Court completely ignored its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.142" offset="951986">I can read the District Court opinion through and never know this finding occurred but this is why in the public interest, N &amp; W was required to buy this stock, because it included -- if Erie is included in N &amp; W by way of control, control meaning we buy the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.300" offset="1024606">These roads would be able to continue to provide adequate transportation service and why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="236.232" offset="1048325">Because and only because of this express finding, the normal earnings of each petitioner, the normal earnings of each petitioner after inclusion will be sufficient to meet their fixed charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.913" offset="1111019">These normal earnings concept and these normal earnings findings are critical not only to the price we had to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.968" offset="1139231">Price was geared to these normal earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.502" offset="1149367">But it was also critical and underlies the Commission's sole public interest finding as to why N &amp; W had to acquire the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.787" offset="1182490">And so I begin by describing how the Commission found and arrived at the so-called normal earnings of Erie railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.540" offset="1217494">Erie had a deficit of $8 million in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.764" offset="1234422">It had deficits every year for years prior there to.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.424" offset="1253021">1965 and 1966, Erie reported net income averaging $5 million, deficits and net income 1965-1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.934" offset="1295130">The Commission took that $5 million of net income in those two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.004" offset="1311431">It added $4.5 million which represented a subsidy that the New Jersey State was expected to and did commit itself to pay Erie to continue to run Erie's -- Erie commuter service and a subsidy in the amount of $4.5 million a year additional subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.441" offset="1377155">$5 million that they made in these two years plus the $4.5 million, that's $9.5 million of normal earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.254" offset="1404426">Now bear in mind, this isn't a guess into the farthest in future.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.065" offset="1419682">This is a finding that Erie had achieved normal earnings of $9.5 million by the end of 1966.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="337.855" stopTime="340.061">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="337.855" offset="1454791">But didn't you say part of that was subsidy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_j_trienens" startTime="340.061" stopTime="424.196">
            <label>Mr. Howard J. Trienens</label>
            <text syncTime="340.061" offset="1463568">Yes sir, and I don't regard that if I have to buy a corporation that's supposed to be earning $9.5 million, I think the fact that $4.5 million is a subsidy dependent on year-to-year appropriations of a legislature makes that a far different character of earnings, but that's what part it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.274" offset="1520515">That's $4.5 million of the $9.5 million is the subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.655" offset="1542040">Now, these past deficits were disregarded by the Commission and passed aside on the ground that Erie's new management had achieved a sensational turnaround.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.036" offset="1583522">A sensational turnaround from all of these deficits now we're earning $5 million and we're going to get this subsidy, so it's a corporation that's going to earn $9.5 million a year, and that's what N &amp; W was sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.481" offset="1637334">Well, it's been some turnaround.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.890" offset="1646947">It's been a complete circle starting with this deficit of $8 million in 1964, Erie came up and earned an average of $5 million for 1965-1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.655" offset="1689997">But this year, Erie is losing money, it's backed the deficits to the tune of $10 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.264" offset="1720404">For the first nine months of 1967, Erie lost $7.7 million, so it's now in this year losing money, tuned about $10 million a year, that's what its normal situation is now and this has been perfectly apparent since early 1967 long before the Commission decided this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="424.196" offset="1800129">Is that after a subsidy from the State of New Jersey?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_j_trienens" startTime="426.684" stopTime="434.910">
            <label>Mr. Howard J. Trienens</label>
            <text syncTime="426.684" offset="1810160">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.143" offset="1811937">They -- this reflects the realization of the subsidy they found would occur so 10 million is lost despite receiving that additional subsidy.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="434.910" stopTime="436.609">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="434.910" offset="1842970">The same -- that same amount, 4.5 million?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_j_trienens" startTime="436.609" stopTime="559.725">
            <label>Mr. Howard J. Trienens</label>
            <text syncTime="436.609" offset="1849762">Yes, I believe so, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.986" offset="1855300">That's my -- that's what we've been told.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.416" offset="1868988">Now I realize that this function of predicting the future is a matter for experts and I know that when the weatherman says that it's going to be a sunny day tomorrow, there's no way I can dispute that, I have to leave that to experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.552" offset="1921546">But when the Commission's finding of $9.5 million of Erie's earnings is involved, we have to remember that this was not what's going to happen tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.046" offset="1951535">This was a finding that they had realized 9.5 million of earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.123" offset="1971911">And this is the like the weatherman saying it's going to be a sunny day all day today and failing or refusing to look out the window to see it's already raining.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.047" offset="2011512">Now, an erroneous prediction under such circumstances isn't a prediction at all and it's not a mere error by some presumed foreseer.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.424" offset="2045053">This is an arbitrary action, arbitrary within the meaning of the administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.080" offset="2067728">To act on the premise that Erie has already achieved normal earnings of 9.5 million, when after receiving the subsidy, Erie is operating at a normal deficit, back to the deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.615" offset="2117883">Now this becomes especially arbitrary when the same weatherman looked out the window in the Penn-Central case being decided at the same time and he found that it was raining on Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.826" offset="2162709">The Commission in the Penn-Central case decided the same time, refused to regard 1965 and 1966 earnings as represented in approving Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.345" offset="2208789">And the Commission placed great reliance on the 1967 reports which were before showing that there had been a decline in Penn-Central earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.019" offset="2243480">Not a decline so that their aggregate was down to a deficit but a decline and they rely on that to support their approval of Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.222" offset="2276289">So I say it's doubly arbitrary when this weatherman will look at the window to see it's raining on Penn-Central but still finds the theory, its normal earnings in $9.5 million was perfectly apparent to anybody to look outside that it is just isn't so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.622" offset="4561899">They are economically interdependent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.989" offset="4667329">And this was a four-way control they call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.718" offset="4682271">Now, there's no suggestion of this Court that B &amp; M's coming into the N &amp; W under this inclusion order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.528" offset="4721455">Now the thing that is remarkable is that this whole District Court opinion is constructed on the premise, the guess of the District Court that D &amp; H was coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.031" offset="4767535">Now why is that critical?</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.251" offset="4776417">The reason it's critical is that what happens here really is that N &amp; W was faced with an order that is a practical matter requires us to pick up Erie alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.728" offset="4814242">That's really what this order does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.310" offset="4836603">It requires us to take Erie who's had this precipitous decline in its earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.139" offset="4859904">There is no finding and I want to emphasize this as much as I can, there is no finding to support the inclusion of Erie alone in N &amp; W.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.126" offset="5071914">Now this is something that the District Court says six separate times in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.960" offset="5095215">We won't reverse on this ground because Erie -- D &amp; H stockholders are so unlikely to reject, not even a serious possibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.997" offset="5151326">We cannot take the prospect of non-inclusion of D &amp; H at all seriously.</text>

            <text syncTime="1434.223" offset="5840227">First paragraph as set forth by the undersigned counsel to the District Court, the D &amp; H Board of Directors voted on September 26 to recommend approval of the terms provided the Commission's orders are held by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.090" offset="5903757">On November 29th, 1967, Mr. F.C. Dumaine Jr., a member of the D &amp; H Board advised that Board that he is in the process of formulating an alternative proposal for D &amp; H's future and that he would not vote to recommend the N &amp; W inclusion terms if when they are submitted to D &amp; H stockholders, he is in a position to recommend an alternative which in his judgment is in the better interest of the stockholders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.877" offset="6030921">He is more than a member of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.511" offset="6041370">He is by far D &amp; H's largest stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.147" offset="6051924">He owns over 11-12% of their total stock and he's eight times larger than anybody else in the Board or owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.907" offset="6103019">The closing paragraph of counsel's letter says that in view of Mr. Dumaine's position naturally, the D &amp; H Board reserves its right to reconsider its position in light of whatever alternative Mr. Dumaine may come up with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.768" offset="9614399">Now the District Court ridiculed our worry, that all -- well, these roads may drift into Penn-Central and Penn-Central would not only have the East but with all these roads besides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.160" offset="9652015">I'd like to remind the Court that this concern has reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.148" offset="9675943">Last year, the Central New Jersey argument and you might inquire where is the Central New Jersey today, well, it went bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.814" offset="9706663">And don't they have counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.735" offset="9710320">Yes, they have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.822" offset="9714709">Why aren't they here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.653" offset="9722023">The reason they're here is that they made an agreement with Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.321" offset="9740622">The eve of this District Court hearing that if Central New Jersey would stay out of this case, Penn-Central would agree to take them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.021" offset="9783463">Penn-Central made the same offer to Reading and it's that availability of Penn-Central as a home that keeps these folks going outside of N &amp; W knowing that they've got this Appendix G subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.662" offset="9834036">Now back of all these, you've got to remember, there's this Appendix G pool that enables these stockholders to lose all their traffic and not be concerned about it because they are protected by the indemnity pool and that's what permits this whole thing to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.202" offset="9900178">Now, I'd to like to close by simply stating that last term, the Penn-Central case has held that that merger was the largest railroad merger in our history and if not handled properly, it could seriously disrupt and irreparably injure the entire railroad ystem in the northeast section of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.436" offset="9977083">The reason that I've tried to outline and -- which are covered in our brief, we don't think that this has been properly handled in the sense that the Commission's action is arbitrary and unsupported within the meaning of this administrative procedure and I realize that the Commission has the responsibility for administering the railroad merger provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.629" offset="10065899">I realize that full well but I also say that the courts have their responsibility to assure that the administrative action complies with the standards of the statute and to protect against arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.658" offset="10118040">The Congress has directed that there would be effective judicial review and we believe that the standards of the administrative procedure have to require that the Commission's orders in this case be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.315" offset="10160671">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.225" offset="10188257">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.529" offset="10213439">I speak for the appellants in Numbers 830 and 831.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.446" offset="10233187">Oscar Gruss &amp; Son holders with affiliates of over 14% of the first mortgage bonds of the New Haven railroad and the committee representing the first mortgage bondholders of the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.446" offset="10285119">The New Haven has been bankrupt since 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.976" offset="10299225">The bonds have been in default, $77 million is the approximate principal amount, $98 million that are claimed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.261" offset="10332453">These are bonds that were issued in 1947 with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the last three organization of the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.445" offset="10369128">They were issued along with about over $200 million of income bonds, preferred stock, common stock that were supposed to be comparatively the risk securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.429" offset="10409044">Divisional bondholders of the New Haven then who had bonds with longer, with their higher interest rates and shorter maturities were required to take these first mortgage bonds that would -- of such high quality, marketability, coverage of interest, and everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.047" offset="10471528">Well, they went into default 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.282" offset="10488456">The trustees who are appointed in the reorganization intervened in the Penn-Central merger proceedings in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.402" offset="10516982">They sought a complete inclusion of the New Haven in the merged Penn-Central to be required by the Commission as a condition precedent to consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.972" offset="10571212">The position of the Penn-Central at that time were opposed that they suggested an operating agreement, they would take in the operations of the Penn-Central for a period of -- by 10 years was suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.456" offset="10625233">The idea was that they could realize the same savings of about $5,200,000 a year that the trustees had shown would result from inclusion of the operations by a complete transfer of the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.300" offset="10684583">Well, after those briefs have been filed, they came to agreement, the New Haven trustees and the Penn-Central management.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.963" offset="10715199">They agreed to a sale of all the New Haven properties to the Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.911" offset="10742993">The trustees would try to abandon the passenger operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.420" offset="10765040">The -- they would receive some day a price which Penn-Cetral was willing to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.205" offset="10792208">In return, the trustees themselves would use their best efforts as trustees to see that the proposed price was approved by the Commission and the reorganization court was consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.114" offset="10847796">And the New Haven trustees also have made the specific agreement to limit any statements they might make in the merger proceedings, any documents they might file even in the merger proceedings or in review proceedings such as this, so that their statements and their filings would be consistent with the provisions and intent of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.337" offset="10932746">That agreement has created some very substantial conflicts of interest between the commitments of the trustees to Penn and Central and the interest of the state in which they are fiduciaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.381" offset="10980916">The Commission came to its first decisions in April of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.786" offset="10998471">And the New Haven abandonment of passenger service case, they denied the right to abandon most of the passenger trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.410" offset="11028982">In the Penn-Central merger case, they approved the merger of Penn and Central subject to certain conditions affecting various railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.910" offset="11063045">As far as the New Haven was concerned, the Commission made the specific finding that without complete inclusion of the New Haven, the Penn-Central merger would not be consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.423" offset="11113096">That finding made in April of 1966 was repeated again in the November 1967 report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.122" offset="11147891">The condition however that the Commission required was not the inclusion, actual inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.660" offset="11177984">It was a commitment of Penn-Central to include the New Haven operation someday on terms to be approved or proposed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.152" offset="11219989">Until after the entry of the order of the court below until after this appeal -- these appeals have been docketed, the Commission had never dealt on the merits with the position of Gruss that there cannot be any reasonable assurance of actual inclusion or any actual inclusion on fair and reasonable terms unless the operations of the New Haven are taken over concurrently with consummation of the merger of Penn and Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.505" offset="11345377">Now, its -- this is a very important difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.157" offset="11363976">It's one thing to keep the New Haven alive by loans as far as the constitutional rights of bondholders are concerned, this means a continued erosion and eating up of their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.014" offset="11411414">On the basis of the November 1967 report of the Commission, the entire price that would be paid by Penn and Central, the Commission approved where Penn and Central was willing to pay, would give the New Haven trustees for the first mortgage bondholders, either $50 million if you can value the Pennsylvania Railroad stock at the speculative price that's fixed by the Commission of 8750 a share or on present market value, you've got $20 million left for the first mortgage bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.272" offset="11548505">Let's assume that you have an immediate inclusion today or as of August 31, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.212" offset="11580270">With everyday that passes, every month, every year, the -- what's left for the first mortgage bondholders is less and less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.535" offset="11605556">It's eroded in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.129" offset="11615901">One is just by the operations, the New Haven trustees don't pay all -- don't pay any taxes really.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.090" offset="11639724">They keep accumulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.645" offset="11645994">They don't pay rentals, most of their rentals for railroad cars and their other administration expenses that reflect the erosion of basic position in a decline of assets that are leftover for the first mortgage bonds, a deprivation of property that the extent that it isn't absolutely necessary as utterly without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.611" offset="11737840">And secondly, you have the enhancement of that deprivation of property both by the refusal to prevent abandonment of passenger service and now by the refusal to provide for inclusion at the time you consummate the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.797" offset="11810565">There are a number of areas of specific constitutional rights that the Commission in the court below just completely disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.645" offset="11841912">One is the right under decisions of this Court, Railroad Commission of Texas against East Texas at what -- one of them -- the right to -- the owners of a railroad property if they cannot operate it on the basis of a reasonable return, they have a right to abandon operations and to take the salvage value that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.144" offset="11939924">This is a right which the Commission is prohibiting in the name of the public interest in keeping the New Haven alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.068" offset="11967613">These are loss operations which the Commission recognizes, will continue to be loss operations as long as they kept separate for Penn and Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.266" offset="12000423">This right to stop the losses and take the salvage value is a vital right which is being denied that -- of the first mortgage bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.766" offset="12038457">The second right is the one involved with the -- this Court's decision in the St. Joe Paper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.677" offset="12062072">Before you can have properly a bankrupt railroad included in another railroad, you have to give the owners of the equity, the bondholders in this case, the right to vote on the inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.091" offset="12111705">This has attempt to force inclusion without giving bondholders anything to say about it, without letting the bondholders as security holders know what is in store for them if the Commission price is approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.602" offset="12169801">And finally, you get the general attempt to force a transaction which will leave bondholders with far less than the amount of their claim, again, without a vote in violation of the decision of this Court in the Radford case and the requirement of a balancing of public and private equities in the Denver &amp; Rio Grande case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.486" offset="12265305">Once this merger is consummated with the erosion of the New Haven continuing, there will be no more power either in the Commission or in the courts to protect the property rights of bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.608" offset="12321834">The bondholders are in a position of seeing their property disappearing no matter who contests what is done by the Commission and the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.620" offset="12357883">If you assume the current price which cuts out all junior bonds, which cuts out all of creditors other than bondholders, you're going to have litigation by those classes regardless of what the first mortgage bondholders do and during that litigation every month and every year it goes on, you have a decline in the property that is left for the first mortgage bonds, an erosion of their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.163" offset="12452028">On the other hand, if you have the courts responding to the appeals from the Commission order and requiring an increase in price, then the same erosion can be had at the option of Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.401" offset="12500929">They can litigate forever while the bondholders bear the cost, while the property of the New Haven disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.985" offset="12531336">And there is no way of compelling them to stop or compelling the losses to stop except by having the Commission do what its public interest findings require it to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.589" offset="12577729">To have the New Haven included when you have Penn and Central merged.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.190" offset="13392123">I'm not suggesting that we could hope to have power equivalent to that at Penn-Central, we can't and don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.705" offset="13426186">But we should have the limited power not to be boxed in, in a situation where we have no control over the continued desperate erosion of our equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.187" offset="13484074">The bondholders are in a unique -- that the first mortgage bondholders are in the unique position here of having people who -- to whom further erosion means nothing, able to litigate and expose the errors of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.149" offset="13539976">On the one hand, and if they are correct in having the Penn-Central able to do it and no matter who's doing it, this erosion continues indefinitely under the Commission decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.013" offset="13587414">It is an erosion which practically can be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.323" offset="13600684">The Commission can see that the word, the findings of the Commission are upheld, that are matched by actual transactions if you have inclusion taking place at the time of the merger granted that there is a theoretical possibility of the inclusion being something less than permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.512" offset="13709458">It still -- there still will have been inclusion and the chances are that it will be permanent that the claims of right will be finally resolved without the kind of hammer that's over the head of the bondholders today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.587" offset="13777690">I don't think that the dilemma is realistically a serious one but the dilemma of the bondholders is really an impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.237" offset="13812276">It is not only the bondholders it's also the reorganization court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.044" offset="13827532">The Court on July -- in its July 11 opinion, requested bondholders to apply to the Commission for immediate inclusion by way of a lease so that at the time of merger you would have a cessation of the drainage away of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.168" offset="13896077">The request was made by its order of August 1, the Commission seemed to be saying until the court below that it was saying that it has set up a machinery for the operations of the New Haven to be included as soon as the merger takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.430" offset="13961070">That machinery has now been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.977" offset="13975280">The Commission hadn't decided completely apparently whether to abandon at the time the Court made its decision, the Court took the intentions of the Commission as a substitute for action by the Commission to see that the inclusion takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.960" offset="14047169">At this point, by the November order, the Commission has abandoned and has left the bondholders and the Court in an impossible debate, nobody controls Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.968" offset="14099205">And once, except the Commission, the Penn-Central is not a party to the proceeding before the reorganization court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.345" offset="14128776">And unless this Court acts, it will be impossible to have inclusion at anytime on any kind of fair and reasonable terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.453" offset="14277151">I'm Edward A. McDermott and I appear for the Boston and Maine Corporation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.790" offset="14302542">Boston and Maine is a New England carrier and is one of the protected roads referred to in Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.138" offset="14327933">Its service has been found by the Commission on two recent occasions at least to be essential and necessary to public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.424" offset="14361057">Now as the eastern railroad merger pattern began to evolve, it was apparent that the eventual inclusion of Boston and Maine in a larger system was desirable and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.564" offset="14413615">Boston and Maine together with Erie-Lackawanna and Delaware and Hudson sought inclusion in the Penn-Central merger in early 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.568" offset="14453635">That petition was denied in April of 1966 without prejudice to refiling under conditions prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.168" offset="14488012">At the same time that B &amp; M sought inclusion in Penn-Central, it also petitioned for inclusion in N &amp; W-Nickel Plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.961" offset="14519254">Erie-Lackawanna subsequently withdrew from that proceeding leaving no connection for B &amp; M with N &amp; W and B &amp; M's petition was again denied buthere with an Appendix O provision with which this Court is familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.426" offset="14581112">N &amp; W proceeded with consummation of its unification with Nickel Plate and other roads and began reaping the financial rewards of that enlarged union and B &amp; M sought negotiations for inclusion in that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.101" offset="14639731">Discussions with N &amp; W summarily aborted with the Dereco announcement and the take it or leave it position by N &amp; W.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.693" offset="14674108">In this situation, and since the Dereco offer unattractive as it was, was subject to a long chronicle of conditions precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.703" offset="14706186">B &amp; M's petition under Appendix O was necessary and was promptly filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.428" offset="14729070">In that petition, B &amp; M sought merger into N &amp; W and its testimony and its studies and its evidence of value were based primarily on merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.230" offset="14764283">Oh, important to an understanding of the Commission's action with reference to B &amp; M in the N &amp; W case is knowledge that N &amp; W's attitude toward the properties of B &amp; M as evidenced in that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.063" offset="14811617">In response to a direct question from Commissioner Webb, the principal policy spokesman of N &amp; W replied that he did not know whether N &amp; W would want B &amp; M if it were required by the Commission to accept Erie and D &amp; H.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.301" offset="14868564">Again in final oral argument before the full Commission in response to a question from its chairman, N &amp; W counsel responded that N &amp; W would just assume -- see B &amp; M go into Penn-Central or remain outside N &amp; W as far as N &amp; W is privately concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.377" offset="14944841">And N &amp; W went even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.643" offset="14953932">It told the full Commission that as far as equity to N &amp; W was concerned, D &amp; H might as well go into Penn-Central along with B &amp; M.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.483" offset="14989354">It said, “There is no economic justification for an E-L, D &amp; H, N &amp; W system”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.654" offset="15021955">Now N &amp; W clearly and intentionally created the impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.998" offset="15035329">It had no real interest in B &amp; M.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.334" offset="15048704">B &amp; M intervened in the D &amp; H appeal to the inclusion order to the statutory court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.082" offset="15071692">Its position there as it is here, is that the Commission committed error in fixing B &amp; M's value as a wholly owned subsidiary of N &amp; W because it failed to credit B &amp; M properly with the savings and traffics gains its inclusion will bring to N &amp; W.</text>

            <text syncTime="3790.859" offset="15266774">We support the entire balance of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.488" offset="15289344">Now B &amp; M's position in the District Court and here is that a fair in equitable terms for its inclusion in N &amp; W cannot be found on the record and Commissioner Webb suggested they could not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.166" offset="15340022">Then B &amp; M's petition should be denied and it should not be foreclosed from seeking a haven elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.520" offset="15369488">A brief word must be said about B &amp; M and its attitude toward the Penn-Central proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.918" offset="15391013">In approving that merger, the Commission after rehearing has provided traffic and indemnity provisions which has revised are acceptable to B &amp; M, and afford the interim protection it requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.763" offset="15442422">B &amp; M did not participate in the earlier appeal to this Court to stay Penn-Central for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.681" offset="15470111">It was of the opinion then and it's of the opinion today that only with consummation of Penn-Central will N &amp; W which to this point has been successful in accomplishing delay have the economic incentive to deal fairly and expeditiously to include B &amp; M as an element of its system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.607" offset="15549837">Also, at the time of the appeal to this Court in the last instance, B &amp; M had assurance by the Commission that hearings would be held on B &amp; M's request for strengthened interim protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.069" offset="15595604">And finally, because of its location, B &amp; M traffic is less susceptible to diversion to a merged Penn-Central than E &amp; L and D &amp; H traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.366" offset="15636877">And because it has afforded this protection, B &amp; M felt that on balance, the public interest called for consummation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.037" offset="15667493">B &amp; M supports consummation of Penn-Central provided the Appendix G conditions are upheld on this appeal and it is an appellee before this Court in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.436" offset="15709080">But the N &amp; W system is our first concern and our primary concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.177" offset="15728097">N &amp; W with a facility often demonstrated over the years of these proceedings had suddenly and dramatically changed the emphasis to suit its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.859" offset="15762787">B &amp; M is apparently no longer the unwanted step child that was pictured to be by N &amp; W before Hearing Examiner Webb and the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.508" offset="15797373">Suddenly B &amp; M is the tail that wags the dog and if B &amp; M finds the prescribed terms of inclusion unfair and inequitable, the whole Inclusion Case must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.149" offset="15840005">This is clearly not the case as appellees arguments will develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.185" offset="15860067">I call again the Court's attention to a statement by the statutory court that relates to a question asked by Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.550" offset="15893608">With reference to B &amp; M's non-inclusion, statutory court stated at page 61, to summarize, there is a sufficient finding supported by adequate evidence that B &amp; M's non-inclusion would not undermine the fairness of the term set for the inclusion of Erie-Lackawanna and Delaware and Hudson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.697" offset="15982111">N &amp; W's representation to this Court and to the court below that B &amp; M no longer regards itself as a prospective affiliate of N &amp; W although often repeated are without foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.043" offset="16031535">I repeat again as we state in our motion to affirm, B &amp; M seeks inclusion in N &amp; W on fair and equitable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.153" offset="16064031">If it does not succeed in that effort, B &amp; M would be willing to attempt to negotiate terms for its inclusion in the N &amp; W-C &amp; O system even though B &amp; M realizes that their proposed merger faces serious problems and that N &amp; W's Chief Executive Officer has termed the N &amp; W-C &amp; O proposal to B &amp; M as a take it or leave it proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.272" offset="16156505">Only if both of those possibilities fail will B &amp; M turn other alternatives to ensure a continuation of its essential services.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.875" offset="16190882">B &amp; M submits that the N &amp; W -- that in the N &amp; W Inclusion Case, the Commission based its essential findings as to the public interest on important substantive findings that under N &amp; W control, petitioner including the Boston and Maine will be able to achieve substantial savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.289" offset="16268518">It found that the petitioners as well as the public will benefit from unified management of what is now several companies operating independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.058" offset="16303626">And to quote, the Commission had found that among others such benefits will include joint routes of affiliated lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.018" offset="16327450">The prospect of single line service, elimination of interchanges, improved schedules and more flexible distribution of equipment, with that one exception, B &amp; M did not receive credit for the savings achievable through the unifications which the Commission found would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.436" offset="16401115">B &amp; M received credit for it but one element of savings, the consolidation of traffic solicitation forces with an annual value of $328,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.248" offset="16444374">Now since the Commission clearly rejected, petitioner's witness wires assumption that the opportunity for savings under control would be so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.269" offset="16480423">We submit it acted arbitrarily in basing B &amp; M's value on those limited sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.782" offset="16502471">In the context of this case, $328,000 a year in annual savings can hardly be regarded as substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.884" offset="16534862">The four-way merger saving studies which were introduced by the same witness wire for Erie, D &amp; H and B &amp; M went unchallenged by N &amp; W.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.035" offset="16575509">B &amp; M's allocable share of those savings exceeded $3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.776" offset="16594526">The $3 million annual savings obtainable upon complete integration of B &amp; M's operations into N &amp; W are substantial and afford a measure of the amount of B &amp; M contribution to savings actually attainable when the managements of these four roads are unified and the operations integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.228" offset="16672266">Equitable terms must reflect but B &amp; M will contribute to the enlarged N &amp; W system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.073" offset="16695672">That was a holding of the Schwabacher case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.770" offset="16706435">B &amp; M's value cannot be determined fairly unless consideration is accorded, its savings contribution to the new system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.529" offset="16737468">The economic consequences of the Commission's failure to do so should not be imposed on B &amp; M by application of the doctrine of administrative finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.049" offset="16775607">Now as a consequence of this failure to properly credit B &amp; M with its contribution, an exchange ratio was proposed for B &amp; M of one or ten which would result in a reduction of more than a hundred and three million dollars below its book value.</text>

            <text syncTime="4569.361" offset="18380779">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.396" offset="18393004">The time allowed for this argument does not permit of a legal analysis in depth but I would hope, be able to achieve your interest and perhaps your sympathy in a problem of Reading which is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.520" offset="18453504">It's particularly unique since it doesn't relate to a dilemma and it has to do with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.815" offset="18482657">The fact of the matter is that the Reading railroad is the only small railroad in the eastern part of the United States that has not received the protection of Appendix G condition and has no assurance of a home in a large system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.586" offset="18557680">We are concerned, deeply concerned that in the haste with which this case must be concluded that Reading's problem may not receive the attention which we think it deserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.288" offset="18612537">It's quite possible that Reading may be the railroad which Mr. Justice Brennan had in mind when he said he feared that a case by case system of restructuring the eastern railroads which had been insisted upon by the Commission who would lead to the destruction of a railroad performing an essential public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.684" offset="18718072">Now Reading's problem, drawn out of the fact that when the Penn-Central merger was first proposed, Reading did not ask inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.863" offset="18754853">It introduced no evidence of traffic diversion and did not oppose the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.865" offset="18778781">They did this because at that time, it believed that there were reasons why it would soon be merged into B &amp; O-C &amp; O.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.589" offset="18829772">B &amp; O had retained experts to make merger studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.702" offset="18846177">It had increased its holdings from 40% to almost 50% of the Reading stock and it had supplied Reading with qualified officers for the express purpose of restoring Reading to a profitable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.442" offset="18909184">However, B &amp; O began to cool on its merger plans and in August 1965, Reading management learned to regret their decision to have kept out of the Penn-Central case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.321" offset="18972609">At that time, N &amp; W and C &amp; O much to the surprise of the world, announced their merger plans which included Reading and CNJ, Reading's subsidiary, solely as a part of the Dereco package.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.584" offset="19049723">The Dereco package consisted of the five small railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.132" offset="19071875">It was immediately clear to the Reading management that this plan would take years for approval and might even never be approved and that in the meantime, Reading would have to meet the full force of the Penn-Central competition unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.515" offset="19149406">And I say, full force of the competition, I mean it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.804" offset="19166542">Reading's lines are practically parallel by the Pennsylvania line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.923" offset="19191097">Virtually every large customer that Reading has is also a customer of the Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="4782.259" offset="19232371">Reading lines are located primarily in Eastern Pennsylvania with trackage up into New Jersey and some down into Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.948" offset="19267166">There is no city of any consequence that Reading serves that is not also served by Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.189" offset="19296110">And obviously with the inducements that Penn-Central will have after this merger many, many of Reading's primary customers can be wooed away and this is what concerned Reading very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.668" offset="19370088">At the time it discovered that its merger plans were completely frustrated, it couldn't do anything about it but it acted just as soon as it could and that was when the Commission's order came out approving the Penn-Central and providing this unanticipated Appendix G condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.095" offset="19451800">Those were unprecedented, and up until that time, nobody had ever realized that the Commission would provide interim protection for a railroad until it had been included into a major system.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm Fooshee</label>
            <text syncTime="5591.319" offset="22468629">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.483" offset="22481272">I represent Mutual Life Insurance Companies owning some $30 million of bonds in the Erie-Lackawanna.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.221" offset="22516276">At the very outset, we wish to emphasize that we do not oppose the immediate inclusion of E-L in the N &amp; W system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5612.028" offset="22551489">We do not ask for a stay of the ICC's order of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.899" offset="22566954">We ask only that it would be made clear that under that part of the order which retains jurisdiction in the ICC, E-L bondholders will have the right to apply for relief if N &amp; W, an important competitor of E-L, should abuse the control of E-L which the plan approved by the Commission gives it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.893" offset="22666951">This basic protection, we have consistently requested from the first time when we were allowed to intervene before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.400" offset="22708955">Our need for such protection stems from the fact that E-L, to be a new corporation to be formed only to take over E-L's present assets and assume its debts is to be completely controlled by N &amp; W which parallels and competes vigorously with E-L's most important line between Chicago and Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.777" offset="22826506">While the Commission spent many pages in finding that the stock ratios to E-L were fair, it made no findings whatsoever to the effect of this plan on the rights of E-L bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.989" offset="22891290">Indeed, it didn't even mention their objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.777" offset="22910516">Now N &amp; W has argued here that Erie's bondholders said they rather see E-L go bankrupt and modify its staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.858" offset="22950849">None of appellant bondholder here Your Honors ever made such a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.571" offset="22973628">We did decline to approve a drastic modification presented to us in a matter of days by E-L's management on a take it or leave it basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.253" offset="23024410">We have never been presented with an opportunity to negotiate a reasonable modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.655" offset="23057951">Now Section 5 (2) specific requirements apply in favor of bondholders as well as stockholders that any plan under Section 5 (2) must be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.102" offset="23107793">Indeed, precisely because unlike stockholders, bondholders lack the power to vote, approval or disapproval of a plan, bondholders are the ones most absolutely dependent on the Commission's protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.581" offset="23169651">Now the need of bondholders for protectionhere cannot, we submit, be seriously questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.588" offset="23197759">First of all, N &amp; W would henceforth -- will henceforth be in a position to divert to its parallel route at E-L's expense, much of E-L's very important Chicago-Buffalo traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.281" offset="23252511">Indeed, there is a positive threat that N &amp; W may do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.527" offset="23269439">A joint report on merger issued by committee of N &amp; W and E-L operating representatives before a proposal of this controlled grant concluded and the hearing examiner found that by downgrading to a single track, E-L's parallel route in double tracking its own and by certain additional unifications, N &amp; W could realize about $17 million a year in operating savings as opposed to about $1.8 million back can -- that were allowable within the realms of control, bounds of control alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.885" offset="23430875">But there is nothing to assure that N &amp; W will stay within the narrow limits contemplated by the Commission once it acquires control and becomes in fact the sole stockholder of E-L.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.131" offset="23483852">On the contrary, E-L itself insisted in April in persuading the Commission to approve this plan that it is simply inconceivable that N &amp; W will not by the early 1970's obtain that enormous, almost 10 times larger, potential gain by merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.676" offset="23558040">And I quote on what E-L said, “Unless N &amp; W finds, it can obtain most of that potential gain while E-L is merely a 100% controlled subsidiary”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.530" offset="23613524">Moreover, there's a further particularly imperative need for protection here where E-L's bonds include more than $70 million of income bonds whose interest of $3 million a year is contingent on earnings of E-L's own line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.914" offset="23698996">Its earnings will depend on N &amp; W's decisions not only as to traffic routings but as to operating expenses, allocations of shared overheads, and the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="6347.441" offset="25493086">Yes, that the decision of the Court in New York operates its res judicata to determine their interest in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.706" offset="25554213">Then we also have the Inclusion Case on which has a long background but which is the direct consequence in its present posture of this Court's decision earlier this year in the earlier -- in the previous term.</text>
            <text syncTime="6387.098" offset="25651806">Before discussing the Inclusion Case, I would like to observe that this proceeding perhaps has its roots 47 years ago in the Transportation Act 1920 when Congress laid down the policy that there should be mergers and consolidations of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.364" offset="25768835">A matter with which the Interstate Commerce Commission struggled for a great many years and as far as the east is concerned, developments have happened only very recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.800" offset="25838529">And with respect to the Penn-Central merger itself, I don't know when negotiations for that began, but the proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission seeking approval of an arrangement which had previously been worked out, it was filed on March 9, 1962 which is five years and nine months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="6461.068" offset="25947617">And in the interval, an enormous amount of effort, the time and thought of many people are representing the private interest concerned representing the public through states and cities and shippers, and the staff and the members of the Interstate Commerce Commission had been working on this.</text>

            <text syncTime="6557.005" offset="26331408">But if I can put it this way, if we look just at the merger alone, there is no one who says that the merger should not be made except the City of Scranton and the gentleman who is associated in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6574.472" offset="26401311">I got the impression during the argument that the position of the B &amp; O and the N &amp; W was that the merger should not be consummated unless the inclusion proceedings were first consummated and consummated in a way that they consider fair.</text>

            <label>Mr. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="6601.177" offset="26508100">That the position of the Norfolk and Western is -- that the existing order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the present circumstances does not carry out the mandate of this Court's decision of last term, which if it is taken one phrase and the opinion is taken literally, that there must be found a haven for these roads that that has not been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.901" offset="26618964">And that therefore the merger should not be carried out until that has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6635.528" offset="26645504">I think that illustrates the point I was about to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.527" offset="26665462">I'm rather a new comer to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6644.346" offset="26680717">And as I have thought about it, I couldn't help thinking of the old Mexican shell game where you put a pea here and then try to cover it and then you move over here and try to find it there and everything -- it's very hard to put your finger on what there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6666.324" offset="26768697">We were told this morning that the situation with respect to valuation has entirely changed from what it was when the Commission made its original order in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6681.965" offset="26831182">And of course it has and it will always be that way whenever the Commission makes a decision with respect to valuation by the time it gets before this Court for review, a considerable amount of time will have expired and the situation will be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6700.063" offset="26903594">If that one is the controlling factor, it would never be possible to carry out a merger such as Congress long ago contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.970" offset="26959287">And then we find that the situation is very difficult because there are constant changes even by letter received by this Court last Thursday or Friday with respect to the attitudes of the parties as to whether they will or will not accept the terms of inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.802" offset="27086555">It seems to me that this or let me put it in another way, I have the fortunate opportunity here of appearing on behalf of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6763.343" offset="27156773">There are numerous private interests involved here which are of course important and which are -- will be fully presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.741" offset="27210376">But the public interest here is to provide the country with adequate and proper railroad transportation on fair terms to shippers as well as to the investors in the railroad companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.768" offset="27310477">The function of the Court in this case, it seems to me is not to administer the Transportation Act, that is the function of the Interstate Commerce Commission which has spent a great deal of time and effort, skill, experience on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6824.475" offset="27401279">And the function of the Court is not to decide itself to the matter, but to determine whether the Commission has acted in accordance with the proper procedures has reached results which are not arbitrary and no one can tell whether the Commission has reached the precisely correct results.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.659" offset="27498036">This is not an area in which there is a precise truth and it is the position of the Government here that the Commission has acted intelligently and fairly, not only in formulating the terms of the merger and of the inclusion but in seeking to carry out the mandate of the Court of the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.783" offset="27634500">When this case was here before, the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission took different positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6893.749" offset="27678386">The Interstate Commerce Commission urged the immediate affirmance of the merger order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.476" offset="27717256">The United States took the position which the Court upheld that the merger should not go forward until further steps were taken with respect to the three railroads, the Erie-Lackawanna, the Delaware &amp; Hudson and the Boston &amp; Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.718" offset="27798235">Now it is suggested that that aspect of the order has not been carried out because we do not have to present to this Court a need -- package in which the Boston &amp; Maine, the Delaware &amp; Hudson and the Erie-Lackawanna are now a part of the Norfolk &amp; Western system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6947.273" offset="27892485">Of course as it was pointed out in the argument earlier today, the Commission has no power to require these roads to accept inclusion in the Norfolk &amp; Western system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6964.438" offset="27961135">What the Commission has done is to fix fair and equitable terms for their inclusion and they are free to accept them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6977.262" offset="28012440">And this is one of the places where the difference between the public interest and the private interest perhaps most clearly appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="6992.225" offset="28072312">The situation in our law is that matters of this sort can depend a good deal upon the action of the stockholders of these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="7007.935" offset="28135111">And we tend to think when we look at things superficially that of course the stockholders will represent all interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.617" offset="28189863">That becomes difficult to uphold when we think in terms of the stockholders, let us say of the New Haven railroad who by no stretch of the imagination have any remaining interest in that property at all and yet it may well be that unless some new law is made that they may be called upon to approve steps which are taken with respect to the New Haven railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="7057.698" offset="28334164">Now with respect to the Delaware &amp; Hudson and the Boston &amp; Maine, we have a situation where the stockholders had been put in a place where they can negotiate, bargain, hold up, offer, try to get a better deal and it is to their interest to refrain from accepting the inclusion terms as long as they can if there remains any conceivable prospect that in anyway from any other source, they might get some kind of an arrangement which would be more attractive to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7111.613" offset="28549831">The stockholders in this situation with respect to both of these companies, Delaware &amp; Hudson and Boston &amp; Maine obviously had been put in a position where they have simply a hold up value.</text>
            <text syncTime="7129.173" offset="28620048">They are -- the consummation of the Penn-Central merger is a matter of very great importance which there is much public interest and which there is great private interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7143.066" offset="28675636">They sit back and say, “Well, we haven't made up our minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="7146.967" offset="28691205">We don't know what we're going to do”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7151.244" offset="28708342">There is great concern about moving the merger ahead promptly not merely because of the private interest concerned but especially because of the situation with respect to the New Haven railroad and its effect on transportation to the whole New England area.</text>
            <text syncTime="7172.677" offset="28794128">Now when one looks at it simply from the point of view of what is the way that I can get the most out of this, it seems to me reasonably obvious that you sit back and wait and try to see if you can't get any better offer from someone in the situation where there is understood to be no power to require the inclusion of these roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="7204.405" offset="28920978">Not only is there this hold up value in the situation but there is also what I would call the playoff value.</text>
            <text syncTime="7213.687" offset="28958072">That you not only have the right to hold up on accepting going in to Norfolk &amp; Western with the great leverage from the fact that because you're hold up, you tie up the whole merger and nobody knows what will happen with the New Haven and all the other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="7230.470" offset="29025259">But you also have the chance to try to stir up interest with respect to other possible customers which might be the Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="7241.274" offset="29068518">It might be some other merger which could be worked out over a course of a great deal of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7250.235" offset="29104358">It might conceivably be some sort of a New England railroad, the viability of which I find hard to be sure of.</text>
            <text syncTime="7266.901" offset="29171022">The Norfolk &amp; Western here makes a great deal of the Appendix G conditions and I must confess that I find some sympathy with that point of view as far as the time duration of those conditions are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7293.541" offset="29277497">It seems to me that it might be possible to bring this matter to a conclusion which is obviously in the public interest if some formulation were found which would require the Boston &amp; Maine and the Delaware &amp; Hudson either to accept the inclusion conditions or to know that they would have to stand on their own feet which is a very hard thing for them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7328.183" offset="29416155">The Appendix G conditions are stated in -- that is the duration, the term of them are stated in full in the Interstate Commerce Commission's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="7341.158" offset="29467982">It seems to me that considering how these matters often go that they provide a period which might extend as long as four years within which these two roads could continue to negotiate and seek to find a better offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7366.918" offset="29571009">If that was reduced to a fixed, flat period, six months, three months, it might be possible to find out what is going to happen here and have something more fixed and specific with which to deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="7456.742" offset="29930350">Norfolk &amp; Western points out that Judge Friendly said on page 61 of his opinion that the Commission made no finding as to the Erie-Lackawanna's Penn-Central losses in the event that the Delaware &amp; Hudson was not included and that is true but that is really an alternative ground of his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7483.420" offset="30037034">Earlier in that opinion, two or three pages earlier, Judge Friendly had pointed out that the burden of proof on this issue was with respect to -- was on the Norfolk &amp; Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="7499.618" offset="30101817">Norfolk &amp; Western was in no sense taken by surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="7503.868" offset="30118849">There was never a joint petition for inclusion, never a petition that the Erie-Lackawanna, Delaware &amp; Hudson and Boston &amp; Maine should be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="7515.109" offset="30163780">There were always separate petitions for inclusion filed by each road and as Judge Friendly points out the Norfolk &amp; Western was the custodian of the figures and knowledge and it had the burden of presenting evidence that -- but permitted judgment of the degree to which the petitioners would protect this traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="7538.877" offset="30258866">It failed to do that even on the assumption that all three were included, let alone on less probable eventualities.</text>
            <text syncTime="7547.915" offset="30295019">So that I think that Norfolk &amp; Western's position here can be answered on the ground that it is presented rather late and that if its real objection is that it ought not to be required to take the Erie-Lackawanna alone, it should have presented evidence on that at an earlier state in this proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="8240.277" offset="33064521">Approval of that system by the Commission gave the N &amp; W three very important things.</text>
            <text syncTime="8245.128" offset="33083852">One, it gave them $29 million a year of annual operating savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="8250.198" offset="33104123">It has already enabled that new system to generate an additional $50 million of revenue over and above what the system was in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="8257.816" offset="33134634">And of course it gave them a great jump on the rest of the East, the Penn-Central in the rest of us.The price of that consolidation was Appendix O which you all know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="8268.859" offset="33178833">Erie-Lackawanna presently has about $230 million of revenue and it rus from Chicago East through Buffalo, New York on a line which is generally south of the lines of the old Nickel Plate and Wabash and now part of the Norfolk &amp; Western and then it runs through Buffalo about 450 miles further east into the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="8292.460" offset="33273187">But the Port of New York area not only has about 10% of the population of the United States but it also does about 10% of the manufacturing and commercial activity in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="8360.618" offset="33545801">Before we filed our application, before we filed our plan with the Commission, we went to our bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="8367.243" offset="33572342">We told them that in the judgment of (Inaudible) who we'd hired as financial experts, the Commission would not authorize a full merger of Erie-Lackawanna into N &amp; W unless the debt holders who owned $350 million worth of face amount of debt would agree to a write down of their debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="8398.303" offset="33696580">And the reason for that was perfectly simple, although that the bondholders were -- had a face amount of debt of $350 million, the market value of that debt was about half of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8409.295" offset="33740570">And if we require Norfolk &amp; Western to assume that debt, it would become the value, the market value of the Erie-Lackawanna bond would double on the day that the Norfolk &amp; Western assume the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="8421.235" offset="33788322">So we said to the bondholders, if you want a full merger in our judgment, you're going to have to agree to write your debt down.</text>
            <text syncTime="8429.079" offset="33819669">You're going to take Norfolk &amp; Western securities for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="8442.760" offset="33874422">Now the creditors sent back the word to us that they were not at all interested and this includes too of Mr. Fooshee's clients and this was before the hearings ever began before the evidence was ever submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="8456.479" offset="33929279">Now Mr. Fooshee and his clients did not come in to the Commission and submit any evidence whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="8462.190" offset="33952162">They did not suggest to the Commission that any plan other than the plan that the Erie-Lackawanna proposed should be undertaken by the Commission until after all the evidence was in.</text>

            <text syncTime="8503.323" offset="34116629">Not poor chances of being paid but the fact that the interest hasn't been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="8507.160" offset="34131989">In the contingent interest bonds and that's what I'm talking about particularly, the market value was only about a third.</text>
            <text syncTime="8514.368" offset="34160828">Interest had not been paid on those contingent interest bonds for three years I believe at the time or perhaps more than that at the time of the plan but the market had valued them relative to the Norfolk &amp; Western which is the problem much lower than the bond of the Norfolk &amp; Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="8533.806" offset="34238568">The bonds also were old bonds and the interest rate was relatively low and I suppose a financial expert would give you a number of other reasons as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="8546.288" offset="34288515">Now, the first thing I think that the Commission looked at in valuing the Erie-Lackawanna was the turnaround and this is an important turnaround.</text>
            <text syncTime="8555.369" offset="34324877">In 1961, the year that the Norfolk &amp; Western entered into an agreement with the Erie-Lackawanna to negotiate forthwith in good faith for the inclusion of Erie-Lackawanna-Norfolk &amp; Western, Erie-Lackawanna lost $26.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8571.595" offset="34389765">In 1963, the last year end figures available to the Norfolk &amp; Western when they irrevocably ascended to Appendix O, Erie-Lackawanna lost $17.1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8584.481" offset="34441279">In 1964, Erie-Lackawanna lost $8.3 million and let me pause in point to the significance of that figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="8593.317" offset="34476596">In August of 1965, the Norfolk &amp; Western announced to the public and then the Erie-Lackawanna that it was entering into a merger with the agreement with the C &amp; O and that as a side proposal to that merger, it would enter into a so-called Dereco plan to take in five small carriers including the Erie-Lackawanna.</text>
            <text syncTime="8615.616" offset="34565831">Under that plan, Norfolk &amp; Western offered Erie-Lackawanna's shareholders a package which they valued at $43 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8625.132" offset="34603865">Now they arrived at that $43 million in a very simple way.</text>
            <text syncTime="8628.932" offset="34619120">This is spelled out in our brief below at page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="8632.126" offset="34631868">They took 1964 earnings, a loss of $8.3 million and adjusted it for two things, first, for an assumed elimination of 75% of the commuter deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8643.658" offset="34678053">And second, for the assumed consolidation savings that would result from theinclusion of Erie-Lackawanna and Norfolk &amp; Western.</text>

            <text syncTime="8838.529" offset="35457442">That is true, Your Honor and I'm going to come to that as my second point and I'll deal with that at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="8843.887" offset="35478967">The Commission used the years of 1965 and 1966 as the base period for considering Erie-Lackawanna earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="8853.166" offset="35516061">And in those years, the new management which Erie-Lackawanna had been fortunate enough to attain -- obtain in 1963, the results of that management begin to show a revenue in 9 -- in the base period, that two-year period, was up $23 million as against 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="8870.800" offset="35586591">But this is important too, the expenses were down $7 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8876.227" offset="35608325">We detail at great length how the new management had turned it around, the Commission accepted and approved that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="8882.635" offset="35633925">Taking the base period, the Commission then made adjustments to the net income for those two years, both up and down, and concluded the future average annual earnings would be normally about $9.6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8897.899" offset="35694947">That is net after all charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="8900.939" offset="35707173">Mr. Trienens read to you this morning the Commission's finding that the public interest would be served here only if Erie-Lackawanna were able to cover its fixed charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="8912.309" offset="35752626">That doesn't mean that Erie-Lackawanna should earn $9.6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8916.293" offset="35768508">It means that Erie-Lackawanna should earn nothing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="8919.587" offset="35781674">That will cover fixed charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="8922.023" offset="35791496">Now let me take this $9.6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="8924.865" offset="35802781">The Commission compared that figure to Norfolk &amp; Western's earnings and worked out a mathematical exchange ratio, the ratio was .172 shares of Norfolk &amp; Western stock for each share of Erie-Lackawanna stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="8939.630" offset="35861922">But they didn't give us .172 to one or anything like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8943.007" offset="35875401">They discounted it twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="8944.507" offset="35881357">First, they discounted it about 25% to .128 to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="8949.922" offset="35903091">Then they discounted to the second time because they didn't give us Norfolk &amp; Western stock, they gave us stock in a new corporation, NC stock which will not pay dividends for five years and which is convertible into Norfolk &amp; Western stock only at the end of those five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="8967.286" offset="35972472">Norfolk &amp; Western's financial expert testified that under those circumstances, the stock of the new corporation would sell for 15% to 20% below N &amp; W's stock into which it is convertible five years hence.</text>
            <text syncTime="8980.353" offset="36024822">So that means that the Commission took this $9.6 million and discounted it about 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="8987.264" offset="36052407">The reason why it did that is perfectly clear and said so, because the quality of the earnings are different and by that they meant the leverage factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="8996.124" offset="36087829">Erie-Lackawanna has relatively high fixed charges and because of its past losses does not pay income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="9002.939" offset="36115101">Norfolk &amp; Western has relatively low fixed charges and does pay income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="9007.283" offset="36132551">That's when you're comparing the net, the fluctuation in Erie-Lackawanna's will be much more extreme --</text>

            <text syncTime="9056.062" offset="36327633">In addition to these earnings said the Commission, even if the earnings are not sufficient to support the exchange ratio, Norfolk &amp; Western's investment will be well protected by the tax benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="9068.683" offset="36378102">These are the benefits that Mr. Fishwick and Mr. Pevler told the N &amp; W Board about.</text>

            <text syncTime="9088.705" offset="36458141">First, each and every year, Erie-Lackawanna will give to Norfolk &amp; Western a million dollars in investment credit, not a tax deduction but an investment credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9099.122" offset="36499832">In addition to that $1 million in the Commission's language, and I quote, “For every dollar by which E-L earnings fall below $10.2 million, N &amp; W would obtain a tax benefit of 48 cents which would directly produce earnings for Norfolk &amp; Western stockholders”.</text>
            <text syncTime="9117.913" offset="36575065">As we show in our brief if we have zero earnings, there would still be a contribution to Norfolk &amp; Western of six million dollars in net income through the tax deduction by filing a consolidated return.</text>

            <text syncTime="9345.562" offset="37485589">The Commission in its report on reconsideration expressly said that Norfolk &amp; Western was wrong and repeated the order and the finding directing Norfolk &amp; Western to include Erie-Lackawanna in Norfolk &amp; Western even if D &amp; H and B &amp; M are not included.</text>
            <text syncTime="9361.743" offset="37550373">Now N &amp; W says those findings are inadequate because they say, this Court must assume that B &amp; M and D &amp; H stockholders were both to reject these terms and because the Court must further assume that if they do, D &amp; H and Erie-Lackawanna's value relative to the Norfolk &amp; Western will be substantially reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="9384.133" offset="37639920">Now if the stockholders both know there are four possibilities that the B &amp; M and D &amp; H stockholders both know, first, they will stay independent.</text>

            <text syncTime="9395.978" offset="37687254">Third, they will become involved in a New England system which is what Mr. Dumaine of the Norfolk -- of the Delaware &amp; Hudson has in mind and that's what this letter relates to.</text>
            <text syncTime="9406.393" offset="37728946">And third, they will be included forth -- they will be included in an N &amp; W-C &amp; O system.</text>
            <text syncTime="9413.047" offset="37755591">I say, the only alternative that the Commission have to concern itself with, the only possible alternative it could have considered is that the two railroad would remain independent because any future consolidation involving Penn-Central or New England system or anything you want, any future consisting -- system -- consolidation requires Commission approval under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="9440.200" offset="37864155">I cannot imagine the Interstate Commerce Commission creating a monopoly in all of New England, Northern New York, the rail service simply because that the stockholders of the D &amp; H and the B &amp; M will have it no other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="9454.108" offset="37919848">But let us assume that they did make such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="9457.716" offset="37934268">The Commission would still have the power and be required to condition that finding upon terms and conditions which would at least attempt to continue to promote competition and the only way to do that is through the Erie-Lackawanna's connection with the D &amp; H (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="9473.039" offset="37995499">That is the time to consider what the problem is, to measure what the problem is, the Commission has shown through Appendix G of the Penn-Central case that it is capable of doing that and that is the time to let them do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9485.622" offset="38045863">But let me just refer to this map and show you what the facts -- the basic simple facts in light of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9494.236" offset="38080345">Erie-Lackawanna and Norfolk &amp; Western will have revenues of $850 million and freight revenues of about $815 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="9502.046" offset="38111587">D &amp; H and B &amp; M will have revenues of about $100 million and freight revenues of about $90 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="9507.967" offset="38135202">The only thing we're concerned with is east-west traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="9512.786" offset="38154533">This -- the east-west traffic presently moves from the Erie-Lackawanna to the Delaware &amp; Hudson at Binghamton, New York and Delaware &amp; Hudson then carries it 150 miles to the B &amp; M and gives it to the B &amp; M a mechanic bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="9527.309" offset="38212629">The bulk of all east bound and west bound traffic on those railroads now moves that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="9533.876" offset="38238856">There are only two present, possible, physical alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="9539.025" offset="38259440">First, the B &amp; M on east -- on west bound traffic that give it to the New York Central at mechanic bill, Rotterdam Junction.</text>
            <text syncTime="9547.648" offset="38293922">That would cut the D &amp; H out of the movement entirely, but the Boston &amp; Maine doesn't do that today.</text>
            <text syncTime="9553.513" offset="38317432">The reason they -- today, deliver it three times as much the D &amp; H as they do to the B &amp; M at the same place -- I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="9562.827" offset="38354631">They deliver three times as much to the D &amp; H as they do to the Central at the same place.</text>
            <text syncTime="9568.358" offset="38376782">They deliver it to the New York Central only that traffic which New York Central has to terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9573.166" offset="38396008">The reason is perfectly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="9575.319" offset="38404681">On this map, we don't have the New York Central but the New York Central has a line that runs from Albany to Boston through Springfield and Worcester that the B &amp; M starts giving away his traffic to the New York Central, it only a matter of days until the New York Central reaches back in to the same origin, and picks the traffic up and that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9593.448" offset="38477197">That's the reason why B &amp; M doesn't give it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="9596.536" offset="38489527">The D &amp; H could carry the traffic given to it by the B &amp; M down to the Pennsylvania at Wilkes-Barre.</text>
            <text syncTime="9602.605" offset="38513768">It doesn't do that today for two perfectly good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="9606.103" offset="38527770">One is because the route is circuitous.</text>
            <text syncTime="9608.646" offset="38537906">The Pennsylvania has to carry it south to Harrisburg to put it on the main line of the Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="9614.370" offset="38560893">The other reason is because it's not economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="9616.778" offset="38570506">The D &amp; H does not receive enough money for carrying out the additional distance beyond bringing it up until Wilkes-Barre so it doesn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9624.156" offset="38599973">And let's assume a Penn-Central system and assume that D &amp; H and B &amp; M remained independent or that Mr. Dumaine's idea, dream of a New England system becomes a reality, what happens to the traffic?</text>
            <text syncTime="9640.078" offset="38663711">First, you have to understand that under the Penn-Central plan of operation, all traffic originating or terminating west of Youngstown, Ohio and destined to or from New England or the State of New York will move on the New York Central main line.</text>
            <text syncTime="9658.898" offset="38738944">But the main line of the New York Central runs north from New York City through Albany where it gears directly west and runs along the southern border of the Great Lakes, the so-called New York Central Water Level route.</text>
            <text syncTime="9670.980" offset="38787323">New York Central is building a big yard at Albany, the Selkirk yard and all traffic will move through that yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="9677.105" offset="38811773">Alright, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="9678.129" offset="38815848">This is the problem that Mr. Shapp and Scranton have.</text>
            <text syncTime="9680.718" offset="38826193">They -- downgrading of the Pennsylvania main line through Pennsylvania and moving all the traffic up to the New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="9687.685" offset="38854092">What happens to D &amp; H and B &amp; M?</text>
            <text syncTime="9690.148" offset="38863914">It's conceivable that the D &amp; H will give west bound traffic to the New York Central at Albany and cut itself out of the hall entirely, its 150 miles from Albany to Binghamton.</text>
            <text syncTime="9701.664" offset="38909994">The D &amp; H might as well go out of business as gives its traffic to the New York Central.</text>

            <text syncTime="9803.696" offset="39318131">The reason we studied it on a merged system is because what we have proposed was a two-step merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="10098.323" offset="40496671">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10101.905" offset="40510986">In view of the expedition of this proceeding before this Court under necessary shortening of the discussion of the issues which this entails in the papers filed with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="10113.820" offset="40558634">I may not be entirely fair to the N &amp; W in what I'm about to say but I think it follows from their papers in this Court that N &amp; W raises no issue at all as to fairness to N &amp; W of the terms for D &amp; H inclusion except its point concerning the absence of a basis for including D &amp; H in N &amp; W, unless B &amp; M is also in fact included.</text>
            <text syncTime="10143.261" offset="40676394">This claim of N &amp; W with this -- in this regard is based on its theory that Mr. Trienens advanced this morning in which you will see repeated a number of times in the November 30th brief that N &amp; W was expected to acquire these three roads only as a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="10166.344" offset="40768763">And as you will see from that brief, that whole argument is predicated on that theory and this theory of a package or that the Commission has predicated its findings on the theory of a package is absurd on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="10182.127" offset="40831875">The Commission did no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="10185.166" offset="40843995">It obviously did not because it expressly provided for E-L's inclusion without either D &amp; H or B &amp; M and for D &amp; H's inclusion without B &amp; M.</text>
            <text syncTime="10196.403" offset="40889031">Instead of predicating its decision on such a package concept, the Commission predicated its conclusions on the facts of geography and its determination to provide as much direct competition for Penn-Central as it can through piecemeal inclusion in N &amp; W of these three roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="10217.535" offset="40973563">Now the reason for that is geographical.</text>
            <text syncTime="10220.524" offset="40985475">Mr. Barr has already pointed out to you that the E-L is has an end to end connection between the N &amp; W at Buffalo and the D &amp; H at Bingham -- Binghamton, D &amp; H is likewise a line that is an end to end connection between the Erie-Lackawanna and the Boston &amp; Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="10237.341" offset="41052766">And the Boston &amp; Maine goes on from the Albany area to Boston and to Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="10246.311" offset="41088606">And these facts of geography coupled with the natural economic forces of competition to which Mr. Barr referred in connection with E-L that makes it equally true that if B &amp; M is not in fact included but chooses to remain an independent carrier, the competition from Penn-Central which B &amp; M will face within New England will tend to force B &amp; M to work even more closely than it does today with D &amp; H, E-L and N &amp; W assuming that D &amp; H accepts the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="10281.423" offset="41229040">Now we've shown in our papers that the terms generally for D &amp; H inclusion are fair to N &amp; W whether or not B &amp; M is included.</text>
            <text syncTime="10290.997" offset="41267388">So I will now turn to the question which had been raised at some length in these arguments today of whether D &amp; H will in fact accept the inclusion on the present terms assuming the Commission's order in the Inclusion Case as upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10310.106" offset="41343770">This question appears to be of significance only on the issue raised by N &amp; W as to the fairness of the E-L terms if D &amp; H is not included.</text>
            <text syncTime="10321.911" offset="41391000">The speculation on this question has centered on the fact that Mr. Dumaine who I must point out has been president of the D &amp; H only since August 1 of this year, has stated that he was searching for an alternative which might be more in the interest of D &amp; H stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="10338.762" offset="41458395">In its jurisdictional statements and its briefs and in its argument today, N &amp; W would have you believe that Mr. Du -- that the alternative that Mr. Dumaine is looking for is inclusion of D &amp; H in the Penn-Central system.</text>
            <text syncTime="10353.381" offset="41516910">They know better.</text>
            <text syncTime="10355.235" offset="41524328">I categorically denied it as I categorically denied it in the court below the only system that Mr. Dumaine has considered as a possible alternative is what he refers to as a New England system opposed to D &amp; H and B &amp; M together and such other New England roads as maybe interested in joining in.</text>
            <text syncTime="10378.713" offset="41618265">Now they've said we've negotiated with Penn-Central in effect because you'll see in the November 30th brief a reference to our attempting to use these terms as a floor for further negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10389.668" offset="41662046">There's absolutely no basis for this implication that we have negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="10394.054" offset="41679600">It is false and there is no intention of negotiating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10397.153" offset="41692035">And even if there were, it would be virtually impossible for any sensible man to think you could come out with better terms for inclusion in Penn-Central after reecting the N &amp; W inclusion terms in view of the fact that the Commission has provided that we cannot be included mandatorily in Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="10416.770" offset="41770402">We're up against an attempt voluntarily to persuade Penn-Central to pay us better terms after they have completely surrounded us by going to -- Pennsylvania going to Albany and to Montreal and going into Boston by this Boston and Albany line center.</text>
            <text syncTime="10434.504" offset="41841351">It is ridiculous just to make any such suggestion that it is Penn-Central that we maybe interested in looking at.</text>

            <text syncTime="10615.917" offset="42567032">They say today, that if included at all, they should be included as a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="10622.712" offset="42594200">I defy you to square this that what they said in their exceptions to the Commission which is the last principal document they filed in support of their own position.</text>
            <text syncTime="10633.345" offset="42636727">When they said in their conclusion, any order for D &amp; H and B &amp; M should be conditioned on the simultaneous inclusion of the other end of E-L but they never said that the inclusion of E-L should be conditioned on the simultaneous or any other inclusion of D &amp; H and B &amp; M.</text>
            <text syncTime="10653.897" offset="42718960">They have deliberately led the Commission into believing that they would accept E-L inclusions without the other two roads and the reason again is economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="10664.201" offset="42760129">Their interest in coming to New York is very real as Mr. McDermott for the Boston &amp; Maine pointed out this morning, they have encouraged on the other hand the thought that D &amp; H and B &amp; M might even go in the Penn-Central system.</text>
            <text syncTime="10680.291" offset="42824495">They have done this not only by saying that they just assumed to see it happened, but they have said publicly to encourage the D &amp; H and B &amp; M stockholders that they would get a better price if they went with Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="10695.366" offset="42884786">This is an effort on the part of N &amp; W simply to offset the terms for the inclusion of these three roads if they possibly can because of the possibility which always exists that the stockholders may not accept the opportunity which is offered to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="10717.133" offset="42971930">There is no intention on the part of D &amp; H to hold up the inclusion of E-L as I have just said.</text>

            <text syncTime="10820.338" offset="43384769">First, they said that upon merger, Penn-Central would be required to participate in New Haven's operating losses for a three-year period upon a formula which had as its maximum, it cost Penn-Central of $5.5 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="10842.245" offset="43472332">Second, that until such time as New Haven could be physically included, Penn-Central would be required as a merged company to be the banker of the New Haven up to $25 million and up to three years in duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="10860.402" offset="43544952">Now, these two techniques provide the means for preserving the New Haven if you have a Penn-Central merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="10872.320" offset="43592704">The first that is to say, the sharing of losses for the first time permits the creditors of the New Haven to have someone else bear the burden of the erosion of the estate that occurs apart from the cash aspects of its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="10889.981" offset="43663339">The New Haven has been operating on a cash basis now since 1961 when the reorganization started.</text>
            <text syncTime="10896.958" offset="43691238">But while its income statement sets out one set of figures, its cash is a problem of merely meeting payrolls no matter how much erosion occurs as you continue to operate and that's what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="10911.553" offset="43749543">This sharing by Penn-Central however, will take part of the burden off the back of the creditors while this s kept alive in the public interest until it has been physically included in Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="10926.453" offset="43809207">The second problem as I indicated which is a cash problem is alleviated because that is the amount of cash which is deemed, would keep the New Haven alive for the next three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="10981.082" offset="44027695">And we say before this Court, the issue that you must consider is -- are those appeals such as to go to fundamentals of the preservation of the New Haven or are they appeals as to which effective judicial review will exist to protect our bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="11001.112" offset="44107839">Now the position which we would take before the Court is, and I will go into these issues in some detail, that no matter what can happen here, there is effective judicial review and there is protection for all bondholders.</text>

            <text syncTime="11039.810" offset="44262588">And that's senior to our first mortgage, that's known as the Harlem River division bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="11045.278" offset="44284531">And we have a bond issue that's junior to our first mortgage known as the general income bonds which has in effect a second mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="11053.858" offset="44318804">Now we have a reorganization plan going at this time to which there has been some reference in the briefs of the bondholder groups here as to which hearings have been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="11064.324" offset="44360704">In that reorganization plan, the trustees have proposed to the Commission that the junior equity in this estate is not the first mortgage, but the general income bonds, and that speed is essential in carrying out inclusion of the New Haven, or that some method is required to have a sharing of losses pending that inclusion in order not to prejudice the most junior equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="11090.770" offset="44466448">Not to be sure, the trustees can be wrong on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="11092.879" offset="44474911">I don't need to argue here if the trustees plan is correct or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="11440.067" offset="45863685">They share the expenses, their car inferences which were in the ratio of approximately 55 to 45, the basis for the allocation of expenses and income from the so-called Park Avenue Real Estate properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="11458.546" offset="45937560">We share Pennsylvania station with the Pennsylvania railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="11462.142" offset="45951979">We own a railroad called New York Connecting, which has as its only function to link up the New Haven and the Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="11468.572" offset="45977684">We own that 50/50 for the Pennsylvania railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="11553.064" offset="46315604">The -- I started to say to the Court that there was -- there were certain fundamental issues as to which we felt there was effective judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="11562.804" offset="46354578">One was the amount of the total value of the New Haven as to which findings have already been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="11569.132" offset="46379865">If that on appeal should be reversed, should be remanded, should be increased, the Commission has jurisdiction to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11577.153" offset="46411943">Second, the amount of this interim sharing by Penn-Central during the period between New Haven's -- between the date of merger and New Haven's inclusion of that merger, Penn-Central's brief before the Court says they recognize they could be charged with a greater proportion if the bondholders on appeal convinced the Court that the Commission treated them too lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="11599.894" offset="46502954">These are -- these go to quantum of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="11603.480" offset="46517269">All of these and they're other questions of quantum of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="11607.258" offset="46532420">The trustees believe that all of these have effective judicial review available as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="11614.405" offset="46560946">We find nothing and anything our bondholder say including the technique of the loans as presenting a problem if Penn-Central should merge and thereafter the Commission has to change these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="11631.486" offset="46629282">The Commission has a general reservation of jurisdiction and it has specific recognition by Penn-Central as to quantum in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="11640.279" offset="46664495">The only remaining thing is, our bondholder say, there are to be traffic protection as well, all are Appendix G in the case of D &amp; H and Erie-Lackawanna and B &amp; M.</text>
            <text syncTime="11653.136" offset="46715904">The Commission has denied that, but even in denying it have said that they've got authority to compensate for it as part of the quantum of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="11662.592" offset="46753729">Accordingly, we submit to the Court that the circumstances are such that whatever maybe the rights of the bondholders of the New Haven, and of course this is not a forum to determine those rights at this time, whatever maybe those rights, there is adequate judicial sanction which would permit the Court to make such changes as might be deemed necessary if the Commission is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="11691.304" offset="46868564">If the Commission is not in error, however, and the Court now enters a stay based on these arguments of our bondholders, we have the anomaly of frustrating the very objective which they presumably would seek with us, that is to preserve the New Haven.</text>

            <text syncTime="11728.924" offset="47019029">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11733.820" offset="47038673">I appear in this case for the New York Central and the Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="11741.294" offset="47068557">The interest of my client by the course primarily in affirmance of so much of the judgment below as it allows immediate consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="11757.829" offset="47134699">And I propose in the time that has been allotted to me to devote my attention primarily to the arguments of those parties who are seeking to defer immediate consummation of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="11776.148" offset="47207946">Now, I am obliged to say to the Court in candor that I think most of the arguments that can be made on this aspect of the case had been touched upon in one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="11790.406" offset="47264998">I propose in general simply to state our position in summarily as I can with reasons for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11799.154" offset="47300002">And if there are any questions from the bench, I shall do my best to answer them.</text>
            <text syncTime="11804.572" offset="47321631">Now the objections to immediate consummation come largely from two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="11810.550" offset="47345560">I say largely because that hasn't been qualified but the two groups who are largely objecting to immediate consummation are first, the bondholders of the New Haven, not the bondholders of the Erie represented by Mr. Fooshee, but the bondholders of the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="11829.356" offset="47420792">And I propose I think to deal first with their contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="11838.862" offset="47458826">Now despite the complexity of their argument and some of the irrelevancies with which I think it is counting, I think their basic position can be stated quite simply and I think answers them.</text>
            <text syncTime="11856.476" offset="47529253">Their basic and ultimate position is that this merger should not be consummated until the Penn-Central agrees to absorb all of the operating losses of the New Haven for the period that must elapse between consummation of the merger and the final completion of the bankruptcy proceedings and actual physical and legal inclusion of New Haven into Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="11892.040" offset="47671568">Now they state that in different ways, they sometimes describe it as interim inclusion, of course it isn't inclusion at all really.</text>
            <text syncTime="11901.789" offset="47710542">They sometimes talk about a lease or about an operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="11905.048" offset="47723604">But it all comes back to the proposition that the Penn-Central should absorb all of those losses in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="11914.049" offset="47759548">Now they've had a hearing on this question before the Commission as Mr. Auerback explained to you, a hearing in the New Haven Inclusion Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="11924.554" offset="47801553">And the Commission recognized that there should be some arrangement to sharing these losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="11932.914" offset="47834990">But the Commission declined to require Penn-Central to absorb all the operating losses and it made findings and stated reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="11949.020" offset="47899460">It found in the first place that, of course under any interim arrangement of this kind, Penn-Central will not have the power of an owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="11961.506" offset="47949406">It can't deal with and dispose the property the way an owner can and therefore, it would not be in a position to achieve the kind of operating economies and efficiencies that can be expected after inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="11976.134" offset="48007920">And since its power would be limited in that way, the Commission said -- thought that that was a reason for not requiring it assume all these interim losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="11987.217" offset="48052224">It's a -- I think a reasonable proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="11989.527" offset="48061524">You don't have a complete power to manage and you shouldn't have complete responsibility with the losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="11996.397" offset="48089004">But the Commission then went on to a second point which is quite important and say -- pointed out that if the Penn-Central should be required to absorb all of these operating losses, the bankruptcy law and the bankruptcy statute being what it is, the litigation among the parties to this bankruptcy proceeding could proceed endlessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="12022.974" offset="48195271">They would have no incentive to impose their differences or to terminate that litigation because their position would be preserved for all this period of time went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="12034.425" offset="48241037">The Penn-Central will be paying the operating losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="12038.294" offset="48256502">The Commission therefore found that it -- and stated it in just about these words in this November 21st opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="12047.588" offset="48293700">It said we think that we can best accomplish our objective which is prompt inclusion of the New Haven into Penn-Central in that real sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="12059.242" offset="48340302">If we require all the interested parties to share in these losses, that will give everybody an incentive to compose the differences and to litigate with expedition and get this proceeding terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="12078.201" offset="48416162">And accordingly, it provided for a sharing of the losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="12084.913" offset="48443016">This whole arrangement last for three years because that was an estimate of the party that what might be required for the bankruptcy proceeding and the Commission applied the formula of the operating losses to determine what losses should be shared and made an order that required the Penn-Central to take and absorb 100% of the losses in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year with a ceiling on the total amount this year to be required and to be sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="12154.100" offset="48719809">The Penn-Central having consummated the merger if it's allowed to do in the meantime will be bound by those conditions as a result of the Commission's original order.</text>

            <text syncTime="13499.310" offset="54100616">The affidavit in the District Court which was in this record, indicated that Mr. Silleck said that Mr. Dumaine had in mind a New England system.</text>
            <text syncTime="13509.359" offset="54140844">In addition to his idea of making the D &amp; H part of a New England system, he said there are other plans that D &amp; H might consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="13595.690" offset="54486183">Now last term, the Solicitor General said in response to this very indemnity pool that's set up, to give the three smaller roads a permanent stay in the financial success of Penn-Central would be almost like decreeing their affiliation with the Penn-Central system and thereby giving that system a virtual monopoly in New England and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="13617.848" offset="54574791">This is what Appendix G does, puts them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="13619.637" offset="54581896">It puts the stockholders in the financial pool with Penn-Central.</text>

            <text syncTime="13917.751" offset="55774333">The argument of the government and the trustees comes to this, that the Commission having determined that the continuation of New Haven's railroad service, passenger and freight is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="13932.884" offset="55834937">It is correct in assuming that it may require the owners of the railroad to sell the assets necessary for a continuation of these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="13942.363" offset="55872867">That the Solicitor General and Mr. Cox and everyone else has recognized that it cannot compel such a sale and that the smaller railroads injured in these instances are not required to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="13958.447" offset="55937128">Now what does that mean in this context?</text>
            <text syncTime="13961.394" offset="55948936">It means that if you permit the Penn-Central merger to go ahead at this time, you will not save the New Haven service, you will destroy the New Haven service because the New Haven is presently owned by the bondholders whom I represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="13979.256" offset="56020407">And those bondholders cannot consent in the light of the serious losses which are falling upon the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="13987.814" offset="56054680">They cannot consent to a continuation on extension of those losses not for another minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="13994.406" offset="56081011">It is no good to them that you are going to erode these assets by borrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="13999.785" offset="56102536">It is no good to them that you are going to find the way for them to sustain these losses for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="14006.579" offset="56129703">None of that is of any use to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="14009.741" offset="56142346">This merger if it goes forward today will destroy the New Haven and its operations because the Commission has made the mistake throughout and believing that it had the right and the power to compel the sale by the New Haven of its operations to Penn-Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="14031.961" offset="56231267">It was a direct value -- it was a direct violation of what this Court has said in the St. Joe Paper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="14041.212" offset="56268257">And as Mr. Isaacs has pointed out, the method by which it was sought to be achieved was by requiring the continuance of loss operations, loss operations that Mr. Auerbach described to you as going on at the rate of 20 millions of dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="14058.088" offset="56335757">Now, it is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="14059.989" offset="56343280">It is not correct that it remains in the public interest for this merger to go ahead even though the New Haven railroad will be destroyed as it must be destroyed and thus these bondholders for their own self-protection must take steps to destroy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="14078.109" offset="56415796">In Penn-Central, it has been recognized or is in the public interest because it was including the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="14085.396" offset="56444949">But if you do not provide for taking up the losses of the New Haven simultaneously with the merger of Penn-Central, if that does not happen, then the New Haven will not nor should it be a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="14101.673" offset="56510046">These burdens have fallen now.</text>
            <text syncTime="14104.216" offset="56520286">These public interest burdens have fallen now on the bondholders for six years in these sums which are extravagant and monumental.</text>
            <text syncTime="14115.817" offset="56566680">Mr. Auerbach still cannot tell you whether Connecticut today will help take up some of those losses in this intervening period for which Penn-Central was going to lend us money and erode our interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="14128.574" offset="56617671">The notion has been that the public interest must be served by the private sector, by these bondholders and we have served it to the point where we're exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="14139.567" offset="56661661">We will not serve it longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="14141.567" offset="56669602">If the public interest will not -- if the states will not come in, if Penn-Central will not come in, if somebody will not come in to take up these losses, the railroad will go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="14152.262" offset="56712443">It ought to go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="14153.901" offset="56719026">It is not a proper solution to put the burden of the public interest upon these bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="14160.195" offset="56744103">And the Commission in all these cases from St. Joe on has never been able to compel a new -- a railroad like the New Haven to accept a merger as a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="14172.202" offset="56792168">Thank you.</text>
