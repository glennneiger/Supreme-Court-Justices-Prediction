            <label>Mr. Ronald Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="29.555" offset="221602">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.582" offset="237693">This case is before Your Honors on cross petitions for certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.810" offset="262562">In case 309, the American Federation of Musicians and its logo late 02 seek reversal of the Court of Appeals holding to which Judge Friendly had decided that certain of the Unions regulations constitute price fixing and violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.043" offset="339571">In case number 310, the plaintiffs four professional musicians challenged the Circuit Court's unanimous decision that a host of other practices which they had challenged and which the District Court had dismissed, did not constitute -- did not constitute violations of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.089" offset="423685">The plaintiffs had raised an entire series of violations of the antitrust laws which both courts below categorized into set -- eight separate categories but it is to the allegation that the unions violated the antitrust laws, the predicate of the majority opinion of the Second Circuit and to the contention that the unions violate the antitrust laws by accepting so called orchestra leaders into membership that I will address to my remarks primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.991" offset="559313">The second point that the unions violate the antitrust laws by seeking and even coercing orchestra leaders into membership, I will address myself to my opening remarks because in our view, it sheds light on the basic contention in case number 309, the price fixing charge and indeed in our opinion, the answer to the question is to whether or not the union may admit the so called orchestra leaders into membership is in fact conclusive analytically under this Court's decision of the question of whether or not the unions may legitimately set a minimum price for the total contribution that the orchestra leader makes to the so called purchase or the music.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.319" offset="768606">Following a five week trial on this entire case involving myriad of issues, Judge Levet who had had a certain special familiarity with the industry, with the practices of the American Federation of Musicians due to a length of this particular trial and to his participation in other earlier litigation between these two parties, dismissed the complaints in their entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.295" offset="876544">His opinion which has contained of course in the record contains comprehensive findings of fact which are meticulously annotated to the lengthy record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.455" offset="925236">And he as I have indicated dismissed the complaints in their entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.049" offset="943522">We rely very heavily Your Honors upon the careful findings of fact that the trial judge made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.770" offset="974451">Indeed, these findings of fact lay at the heart of this case and in the findings of job and wage competition as I shall attempt to show to you Your Honors in fact or conclusive of the legitimacy of the unions' contentions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.501" offset="1041324">Although the plaintiff's here in case 310 attack the unions' regulations and so far as they pertain in all fields of musical endeavor, both courts below considered that the primary -- indeed the main attack concern the so called club-date field which was by stipulation said to be single engagements concerning social affairs such as Bar Mitzvahs or weddings and other comparable social events.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.269" offset="1188446">The plaintiffs in fact in this case, the four remaining plaintiffs do perform and there is a finding to the effect that they perform primarily in the club-date field.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.544" offset="1233586">The so called non-club-date field would include theatrical engagements, opera recordings, nightclub acts, and engagements of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.272" offset="1272456">The club-date field again is single engagements concerning social affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.936" offset="1299101">Now, in order to understand the nature of this particular field and the manner which these particular engagements come about, it might be helpful to describe the -- some of the testimony of the witnesses as regards the method by which a so called club-date comes about.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.498" offset="1381334">Normally, the purchaser of the music, the sponsor of the social affair will approach a given musician.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.602" offset="1409755">You might have met that musician before, seen them in the previous engagement or he might even be a relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.645" offset="1437968">In some circumstances where the fact that a given engagement is to come about that there is to be a Bar Mitzvah that there is to be a wedding is known the musician will approach the sponsor of the activity himself seeking the engagement.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.407" offset="1509021">Now, when the sponsor of the engagement in the pawns of the trade, the purchase of the music engages that particular musician and to obtain to play that engagement and to obtain the other musicians who will play, that leader by that act becomes the leader for the engagement and he then undertakes the responsibility of playing that engagement, obtaining the other musicians who will play who are called sidemen, straight instrumentalists.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.372" offset="1640887">Now the particular musician who has assumed the responsibility of leader might be acting his particular time for a leader for the first time of his life, for the hundredth time in his life, he might -- the very afternoon on which he is to play as a leader that evening, perform as a sidemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.534" offset="1713507">The fluidity and the interchangeability of functions in this field as outlined in the record and is in the findings of fact is considerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.755" offset="1754363">Musicians perform in many fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.614" offset="1761782">They perform in the club-date field, the non-club-date field.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.946" offset="1775156">They are sometimes leader and sometimes sidemen.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.798" offset="1818520">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.410" offset="1828968">On each engagement, there will be someone performing the leaders function.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.825" offset="1854673">Now at -- in response really to what Justice Harlan has just said, at each engagement, there will be a person who will perform the conducting function and that is the leader's function, the obligation to conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.720" offset="1910262">Now the leader will also and almost instances playing instrument as well as conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.207" offset="1936175">The sidemen of course as instrumentalist do playing – play an instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.303" offset="1956551">Now there are occasions in this field in which the particular leader in question might have two or more engagements on the same night.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.214" offset="1988211">And under those circumstances, he will obtain what is called a sub-leader to perform the leading function, to do the conducting at that particular engagement.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.904" offset="2030947">So that in essence, there are the sidemen who perform as instrumentalist, the sub-leader who both conduct and generally will play an instrument and the leader who will conduct if he is present to a particular engagement and will generally play an instrument as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.550" offset="2145573">That is the -- the person who does the obtaining is a leader but the conducting function might be performed either by the leader or by a sub-leader.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.541" offset="2221537">What you're telling me is that the man -- if the man who obtains engagement play at a particular club-date and he will always -- he will always be the leader I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.229" offset="2276289">That means select some music and determine some tempo and so on, is that what you're telling me?</text>

            <text syncTime="549.351" offset="2300740">Well, there are -- there are conceivable occasions on which the person is obtaining will not in fact perform the conducting function but that is the rarity and I was attempting to describe the basic pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.353" offset="2360822">Now, although the unions contended that the original trial of the case that the leaders in this circumstances are not employers in the club-date field, we will for purposes of our case before Your Honors assume as Judge Levet, the trial judge assumed that leaders are employers because we believe as did the trial judge and as did Judge Friendly in his dissent that there is no antitrust violation here regardless of whether or no the leaders are called employers whether they're called independent contractors or whether they are called what we would call them working musicians who perform at the trade, who conduct, who play instruments and that is the critical aspect as far as we are concerned and not the fact that they might be called employers and not the fact that they might be called independent contractors.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.167" offset="3623999">We have not in any of our papers to this Court ruin into that point at any great length because of our basic belief that a case can be answered without this Court deciding that issue, deciding as Judge Levet or did assume that the leader is the employer that the issues are the same and that the ultimate conclusion is that there is no violation of the antitrust law and any of the items in this particular complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.376" offset="3740923">The -- as I indicated previously, the major -- one of the major contentions of the plaintiffs throughout has been that the union violates the antitrust laws by admitting leaders into membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.913" offset="3790973">And this contention was advanced despite the plaintiff's own stipulation that the leaders have traditionally for at least 65 years been members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.919" offset="3839039">In both court's below found that in fact, that in the commercial or non-club-date engagements where there formal collective bargaining agreements which cover the leader as an employee that the leader is in fact the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.571" offset="3905703">Both courts below made that finding in the non-club-date field.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.392" offset="3928900">As indicated, the trial court decided it unnecessary to his decision to reach a conclusion on their status in the club-date field.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.930" offset="3967143">Thus when the plaintiffs asked the trial court to bar leaders, the unions from seeking leaders into membership, they seek to obliterate practices which this union follows its inception, no recent practice, no recent idea of the type occurred to the people involved in the Grease Peddlers case or the Hinton case but rather the membership of these people in the union was a long historical practice stemming from the fact that they are working musicians that when they conduct and when they play instruments at these engagements, they are working musicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.302" offset="4124609">Now the trial court attempting to answer the questions presented by the complaint stated that the issue before him had to be resolved on the basis of this Court's decision in Meat Drivers versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.388" offset="4184900">But the question before him was whether or not the leaders were in such job and wage competition or other economic relationship that the union had a legitimate right to seek and to take these people into membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.117" offset="4251878">And he concluded on the basis of carefully detailed lengthy findings set forth in this appendix that the leaders when they conduct, displace a sub-leader from a job when they play an instrument as they almost always do, they displace a sideman from a job and predicated on those findings of job displacement by the leaders, he concluded that the leaders were in job and wage competition with the union's other employee members and for that reason, the union did not violate the antirust laws by admitting leaders into membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.998" offset="7047398">We believe that that particular regulation which is not the predominant situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.069" offset="7071640">It's a miniscule part of the basic picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.028" offset="7095463">In that particular situation, there's a quite different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.118" offset="7107793">Admittedly, that situation is far more difficult for our purposes in terms of its legitimacy than the situation of the -- with the performing leader where the man actually works at the trade where people can see him so to speak and wavings it's baton or playing its instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.213" offset="7176234">In the situation where he doesn't perform, we believe that the facts of the industry and as the trial court found, show that there is so direct relationship between the price of this so called non-performing leader charges and the amounts that the sideman will receive but under those circumstances, the unions regulation of a price is legitimate because it is Justice White's words, a matter of imminent and direct concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.206" offset="7296188">But that is a quite different argument Your Honor than our fundamental argument about --</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1818.131" offset="7375914">Because Your Honor, our answer there is tied very directly to the special circumstances of this industry is found by the trial judge and that is the kind of fluidity, the interchangeability among functions in this particular used to be as such and the lack of any capital and requirement of any capital investment in the specific findings based upon the evidence that where the leader be he performing or not performing does not obtain as a price to the unions minimum the sideman won't be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.176" offset="7520110">Now that's a very unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.709" offset="7530245">That's quite unlike the situation which Your Honor attempted to said out about an automobile where the union can't show that kind of direct intimate relationship, a one on one relationship so to speak and I think that the -- basically, these notions are non-performing leaders is really de minimis in the sense that it's so small apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.532" offset="7625540">What we're talking about primarily is our concern about the performing leader, about the leader when he conducts and when he plays on an instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.269" offset="7672456">That is the fundamental aspect of our case and when he does that as I have indicated, he is in job and wage competition with the unions' sidemen or sub-leader members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.341" offset="7724701">And it was on that basis that both courts concluded that the union had a right to seek the leader as a member and the trial court on the basis again of that particular finding, on the findings of displacement and of job and wage competition, concluded that the union had a right not only to take them into membership but to set a rate for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.265" offset="7816443">Just a rate comparable to the rate for other musicians and to require in order that that rate maybe received that it will actually be received by that particular musician that they each have a minimum price through the purchase or the music.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.219" offset="7884257">Now the reason for the charge of the price is that where the leader or any independent contractor or employer in this sense is to receive moneys and if you call an employer who receives prices, if you call him an employee, he receives wages but it's the same money for doing the same thing and what the union must do as it did in Oliver is to assure that he in fact receives in his pocket, the leader in our case or the owner operator in the Oliver case that Your Honors decided, receives in his pocket the amount that the union has set for the wage scale and as in Oliver, he is in fact charging an amount for a truck which is less than the true rate for that particular truck, he is not getting the wage scale because the difference between the true rental of the truck and the amount that he has received must be subtracted from his wage scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.021" offset="8131480">And so if the leader here receives something less than his total contribution for the performance, he is not getting the wage scale for the function that he is performing, conducting and acting as an instrumentalist and that is essentially our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.572" offset="8209638">There is of course the argument quite different about the situation of when the leader does not perform and there, as I attempted to indicate to Justice Fortas, the special circumstances of this industry and the miniscule amounts involved in that particular case, show that the union has not violated the antitrust laws in that particular circumstance as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="3596.762" offset="14490415">Take for example the situation that prevails in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.106" offset="14507760">Local 802, every so and so often negotiates with representatives of the hotels, nightclubs and restaurant and presumably, the negotiation is confined to the employees, the hotels, nightclubs and restaurant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3623.585" offset="14597726">But Your Honors, that isn't true and the facts in this record are contradicted on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.502" offset="14721337">Mind you, they were not ready to these negotiations in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.086" offset="14735757">They didn't even have notice on them but the negotiations at that time were now applied to my clients, the same is true of when we say radio, television.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.402" offset="14784972">The radio and television contract is negotiated with the big companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.357" offset="14808795">All of the smaller companies then follow -- the union prints a contract and they all have to sign it and when my clients perform a single engagement and they don't do it often, I will admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.334" offset="14860727">When my clients perform a single engagement on radio or television, they must comply with the negotiations -- negotiated standards between the big television or radio stations and the -- now, I want to say too Your Honors that my complaint from the beginning, urge the fundamental distinction between said steady and single engagements, no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.437" offset="14977128">As a matter of fact, Your Honors can look in vain through the bylaws of the international or the Local to find any reference to club-dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.597" offset="15017775">Club-dates are just one department, the largest department that I would admit has single engagements and when the court below ruled on price fixing for example, it did not use the words club-date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.077" offset="15075662">It said orchestral engagements so that it covered both single and steady engagements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.241" offset="15108368">Now, it would be easy, I think, on the basis of this record to be confused by the fact that there are -- there were testimony from a variety of different types of orchestra leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.768" offset="15166464">On the union side, the union did not produce one single witness who was a professional orchestra leader, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.183" offset="15204080">That is to say one who gave his full time to being an orchestra leader never played his assignment, and they are the only people that I represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.607" offset="15237831">I don't have to go into the status of this other margin of the type of orchestra leader because I'm not concerned with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.539" offset="15265520">My own disposition is to believe that even they are employers pro tonto but that's not essential to my case here and I think that when Mr. -- when Judge Friendly in his dissenting opinion below spoke in terms of interchangeability, he was talking about the kind of orchestra leader that I don't represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.607" offset="15353814">I have no doubt that Max Sanso who testified that during the three years, he had eight or nine engagements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.635" offset="15385893">I have no doubt that he could improvise orchestra at any time and that he would be interchangeable in that with other employee musicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.898" offset="15435003">That isn't the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.180" offset="15440123">I'm talking about the kind of orchestra leader who is the professional and he is vastly different from the employee sideman because he is the risk taker in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.973" offset="15503235">It isn't as the -- my adversary's briefs reported and that as Mr. Rosenberg just put it that the usual procedure is for purchaser of music to approach of musician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.427" offset="15549106">No Your Honors, the usual procedure is for my clients to run up telephone bills of $4,000.00 and $5,000.00 a year when they read in the newspaper about fourth coming social events.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.920" offset="15607097">And they solicit and when they have -- didn't have that kind of solicitation, in the end accumulated the kudos that comes with reputation then people come to them and call them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.057" offset="15663626">They never go to my client's sideman and ask them to get together in orchestra.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.454" offset="15685151">And when my client stands before an orchestra, they do one or three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.296" offset="15704586">Some of my clients like Charles Peterson had never play an instrument.</text>

            <text syncTime="4836.971" offset="19451277">Well, I would say that for example, some of those items are clearly part of pricing and some are wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.759" offset="19474369">For instance, the unilaterally prescribed wages, I can't say that that's part of -- that's pricing as such, but I do object to the manner in which they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.840" offset="19514702">They unilaterally prescribe the wages but when you have leader's money, when you have the 8% surcharge, when you have the cartage, when you have the minimum quota of employer -- employees where the minimum quota includes the employer himself, then I say these are all ingredients of price and not of wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.695" offset="19606131">That's what I mentioned, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.623" offset="19617834">Now, I might say too that it seems to me that the significant question on the item of whether or not my em -- my clients are employers and every one of the people I called, every single one of them testified in effect that my clients were employers, but the significant question is not whether these employers do certain things which are similar to things done by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.147" offset="19736012">They're not exactly the same because by that token, a glassblower employer, an electrician employer, any kind of employer, including the president of General Motors, he certainly does certain things that some employees can do or does certain things that are similar to what employees do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.605" offset="19809782">The important question is, are they businessmen with independent businesses and are they employers?</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.263" offset="19836426">And I say there's nothing in the record to contradict the repeated testimony that my clients are employers and independent businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.858" offset="19878849">Now, we come to the -- another question, and that is a strain that goes through all of my adversaries' briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.500" offset="19929422">They keep talking about job and wage competition, and this was true in -- during the trial constantly, but no one, including the courts below or my adversaries ever took the trouble to analyze precisely what is meant by competition in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.977" offset="20031300">And as I see it, there are only seven possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.790" offset="20054497">First of all, the competitors must necessarily be, if I understand them correctly, orchestra leaders like my clients who are entrepreneurs, and employee musicians who are union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.063" offset="20119594">Those are the two competing bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.512" offset="20129416">Now, for what can it be realistically stated they compete?</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.177" offset="20156061">Well, it's conceivable that these two would compete for jobs as leaders, and I don't think that there's any union that should have any right to regulate whether a sideman should compete for a job as a leader, or any association of leaders to regulate whether a sideman should compete as leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.449" offset="20253132">And incidentally, Justice White, there is an association here, a National Association of Orchestra Leaders, and they do not fix prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="5071.917" offset="20391058">And I would suppose they would have to claim since their claim in this case in effect that is part of that collective bargaining contract, the association and the union could agree as to what the ultimate crisis the members of the association would charge for single engagements or extended engagement.</text>

            <text syncTime="5138.466" offset="20657194">Well, as I say, competition for jobs as leaders is really nothing except competition for entry into the ranks of employers, and I don't think any union or any employee association has the right to close the door on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.742" offset="20718320">The second type of competition would be for jobs as sub-leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.517" offset="20737442">Now, I might say that a sub-leader is a kind of supervisory employee musician who takes over the direction and control of an orchestra when the employer himself can't attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.805" offset="20806614">This institution of sub-leaders is very limited throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.990" offset="20827303">I suppose it has its greatest scope in the city of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.775" offset="20842454">But in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago, I think there are a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.330" offset="20860740">But they are definitely supervisors within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act in my opinion, and I have always taken the position that if Congress saw it fit to exclude from the bargaining unit or from the union that has organized the employees, the supervisor afore certiorari, then employers like my clients should not be in the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="5222.798" offset="20994591">They watch to it -- they see to it that all of the amenities of social intercourse are observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.100" offset="21015803">If an orchestra leader -- orchestra member were to become drunk, they have the power of firing right on the spot or order him home.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.917" offset="21051016">You know, they stand in the place of the leader during the performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.450" offset="21077138">The third kind of competition would be for -- for jobs as sub-leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.098" offset="21103783">Now -- I mean, for jobs as sidemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.046" offset="21115591">It should be obvious that professional orchestra leaders who command much more of income than either sub-leaders or sidemen are not competing for jobs as sub-leaders or as sidemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.680" offset="21174105">My clients -- there was no evidence whatever in this record to show that my clients ever competed for jobs as sidemen or as sub-leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.853" offset="21210781">And that could be competition for musical engagement contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.334" offset="21232724">That would be more or less in the way of acting as a broker or a man says I'll -- I'll get you the band or give me the contract and I'll see that the performance is carried out alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.882" offset="21290924">But he himself is neither a musician or if he is, he doesn't perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.406" offset="21309001">That kind of competition wasn't mentioned in our record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.713" offset="21326242">The four -- the fifth is competition for the income of professional leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.922" offset="21355081">And again, that -- there was no mention of that in any part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.885" offset="21374934">The sixth, well, competition for wages of sub-leaders, supervisors not mentioned at all in the record, and seventh, competition for wages to sidemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.880" offset="21418924">My clients never competed for wages of sidemen, but there was no evidence of that up to that point at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.636" offset="21445883">Now, I think that it's important to emphasize briefly that Judge Levet at the trial court, when he talked about named bands assumed that named bands had to be organizations of national reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.101" offset="21535744">I submit that the evidence in the record here is undisputed that a man can have a named band in the city of great New York or in the environs of New York and not being known in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.611" offset="21585795">So that the whole question of name is a very relative thing, except that there are indeed a 20 or 30 named bands that command towering prices and great audiences, and they are known to practically everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.794" offset="21670536">A question was asked about whether -- if one of my clients were to come to Washington and play an engagement here with his orchestra, he would be subject to filing requirements here with the local here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.214" offset="21732185">The answer is of course yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.621" offset="21741902">In other words, he would have to file his contract for a single engagement here in Washington and the local here in Washington reserves the right not to approve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.827" offset="21786728">And if the union here does not approve it, he simply can't play here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.198" offset="21804178">This is done regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.336" offset="21812746">And the territorial restrictions are very numerous that are imposed unilaterally by this union and abided by all of these outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.329" offset="21872724">For example, one of the provisions in the bylaws is that since our institution of the suit has been eliminated was a provision which actually told the leader that he had no right to borrow money to advance the business of his own orchestra unless he got the permission of the president of the international.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.114" offset="21979826">Then of course, if one of my clients were to book an -- a steady engagement in Chicago, for example, he would not be allowed to book any single engagement during the period of that engagement and he would not be allowed to book it for a period of five days before or five days after.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.552" offset="22057566">And he couldn't even book it if he booked it during that period to be performed six months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.996" offset="22083375">And many of the locals with the approval of the international seek to protect the local musician, the local orchestra leader from competition by orchestra leaders who invade.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.320" offset="22136665">And of course, the -- one of the most important territorial rules is that whenever one of my clients comes from New York and visits another jurisdiction where the prices and the wages are lower, my client is bound by the higher of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.008" offset="22207404">In other words, since the Local 802 rates are generally speaking throughout the United States the highest rates in the industry, my client, if he goes to Newark, New Jersey for example, must compete with local musicians there on the basis of the higher New York prices against the lower Newark prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="5563.247" offset="22356407">If Your Honors were to examine the bylaws as they prevail at that time, you would see all sorts of prices, not wages, prices fixed for also -- for instance, at a carnival or a rodeo or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.743" offset="22418369">Now, since that time, the latest bylaws that I've observed has kind of circumvented that difficulty by saying write to the office of the president for the prices on this, and they're not set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.742" offset="22482317">But the point is that they are nationally fixed in some industries, radio and television being a pair of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="5626.223" offset="22608227">One, all of our locals here, all of the AFM locals and the AFM itself have regulations which impose obligations on all members, including orchestra leader employers, that they can never compete at prices below the prices fixed by the respective locals or by the international.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.780" offset="22706448">They -- Article 25 of the AFM bylaws requires every booking agent to get a license before he can operate as a booking agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.461" offset="22753259">And it also forbids any orchestra leader to make use of the services of a booking agent unless he is licensed by the AFM.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.693" offset="22794115">Now, the AFM reserves the right to vacate the license of the booking agent for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all, and without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.020" offset="22839463">And it requires the booking agent to sign a contract that he will -- all his negotiations observe the bylaws of the federation and of the local involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.257" offset="22896410">And finally, the -- one of the most effective means used here for violating the Sherman Act is the use of the Form B contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.535" offset="22953462">Now, I might say that since this trial, Local 802, because of the constant thunder of criticism that we leveled at the Form B contract, to which I'll come in a minute, has dropped that Form B contract and published another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.436" offset="23029112">The other one made explicit what was implicit in the Form B contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.045" offset="23051577">So we immediately moved in the United States Court of Appeals for an injunction against it because it fixed prices and we obtain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.569" offset="23089612">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.472" offset="23121272">May it please the   court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.408" offset="23132975">One of the indications of the matter in which professional leaders garner most of the important business was provided by one -- three exhibits introduced by the defendants themselves, defendants' exhibits L, M and N.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.271" offset="23200475">And one of those three showed for example that 4.9% of the persons who filed contracts as leaders had gathered into their business 52.4% of all of the contracts for engagements signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.657" offset="23278007">The status of my clients as employers, contrary to what the District Court found without the benefit of any evidence in the record, remained the same even when they play on radio and television, or when they do recordings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.670" offset="23350000">Certainly, it should be obvious that a named band leader for example doesn't change his status as employer simply because he makes a recording with his own musicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.944" offset="23391169">It is true nevertheless that very few records are today made by orchestras as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.789" offset="23418546">The day of the big band has somewhat receded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.254" offset="23432338">But whenever my clients, like for instance, Sye Zetna, one of them -- he made -- I've forgotten how many albums.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.170" offset="23460028">Whenever he performed, he performed with his men so that his status didn't change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.951" offset="23479150">And Hank Thompson and another one who testified, he's one of the leaders in the field of country music, he was required at one time by the union rules and by -- by the recording company that was enforcing the union rules to stop the system under which he was getting a lump sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.972" offset="23563264">And now, the recording company advanced out of his royalties moneys to pay the employees, so that the money went only because of union rules from the insure -- from the recording company to his employees to give the appearance that the recording company is the employer, but it was subtracted from his royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.188" offset="23660126">I am challenging those findings of the court below that deal with competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.644" offset="23689906">I say there's no evidence to show that there's competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.560" offset="23701608">And also, those findings of the court below that say that my clients suddenly lose their status as employer or businessmen when they do recordings or do TV appearances or television appearance because I say there's absolutely no evidence in the record to substantiate their loss of their status.</text>

            <text syncTime="5924.447" offset="23801187">Your Honor, I specified them in more -- in my brief somewhere, but I don't remember the number offhand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.015" offset="23831385">Now, I referred before to the Form B contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.283" offset="23852492">The Form B contract not only is the result of a mandate from the bylaws of the AFM but it is a mandate that is pure fiction and misrepresentation in significant parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.956" offset="23903169">For example, the orchestra leader who makes use of a Form B contract is required to acknowledge by his signature that he is not the employer but rather the employee of the purchaser of the music.</text>
            <text syncTime="5962.982" offset="23955310">And yet, that's done as a matter of form without any relation to reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.354" offset="23976835">Also, the Form B contract incorporates by reference all of the AFM bylaws and the local bylaws, and it contains the fiction for example that the purchaser of the music hires the sidemen in the orchestra through the agency of the leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.250" offset="24060322">Then, one of the things that's incorporated by reference has a particular bearing upon traveling engagements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.741" offset="24094386">You can understand that if an orchestra travels from place to place, they -- if he visits Chicago for example and then goes to San Francisco, the Chicago local won't be able to have jurisdiction over him to file charges of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.842" offset="24154781">Well, in those cases, the federation, the international takes care of all the charges and processes them and adjudicates them by means of the international executive board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.951" offset="24203160">And if there are any fines, as there sometimes are, the fines go into the treasury of the international, the very organization that is adjudicating the case under a pseudo-arbitration system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.910" offset="24267003">The purchaser of the music, even though he is not the purchaser in the ordinary sense, is sometimes subjected to union boycotts and threats in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.230" offset="24328338">If an orchestra leader is not a member of the union or if he charges less than the minimum price prescribed by the union and he does that in X dancehall in Oshkosh, then that X dancehall is now put on an unfair list and no other person belonging to the union, whether employer or employee, is permitted to perform there until he's taken off that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.145" offset="24435963">And of course, I don't know whether I stressed before that no booking agent is allowed to book for any musician unless he belongs to the AFM or one of its locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.704" offset="24498239">I'd conclude with this quotation from the Pennington Case and with a suggestion that what was left to speculation and hypothesis in the Pennington Case is the case that's actually presented to Your Honors today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.724" offset="24566262">If the UMW, in this case, in order to protect its weight scale by maintaining employer income had presented a set of prices at which the mine operators would be required to sell their coal, the union and the employers who happened to agree could not successfully defend this contract provision if it were challenged under the Anti-Trust Laws by the United States or by somebody injured by the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.341" offset="24692694">That's the quotation, and that is exactly the case we have here because price lists, as the president of the local -- of the international admitted, are universal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.534" offset="24729475">Every single local of the 683 locals of the federation have their own price lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.977" offset="24759254">And the federation itself has its price lists on national problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="6174.940" offset="24803140">In my opponent's argument, there are many, many statements made about lots of things that the musician's union does lots of statements about the nature of various negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.280" offset="24852459">None of these things are in the record and none of them are the facts as they exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.109" offset="24871790">The facts are as found by the district judge and as confirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6198.122" offset="24895822">And Your Honors, I have before you a distillation of a lengthy trial in the findings of the District Court, an apt description of what occurs in this particular industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="6221.348" offset="24988714">There are -- there is one or two little matters of -- very small concern, but nothing of a fundamental nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.260" offset="25024449">Their -- in my opponent's presentation today, he made the statement, and I think this really lies at the heart of our case, Your Honors, that the sub-leader stands in the place of the leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.815" offset="25070634">Now, there was a stipulation that the sub-leader is an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.247" offset="25092368">There was also a stipulation that the sideman is an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.823" offset="25110653">Now, when this -- when the sub-leader stands in the place of the leader, when he performs precisely the same work function, then there is such danger to the wage standards of the sub-leaders and of the sidemen musicians when the leader is permitted to form -- perform in an unregulated fashion that the union has the right to reach that particular type of disruption of its wage standards, and that is the basis of our reliance upon Oliver and of our reliance upon Jewell T. and this Court's expressed recognition in Jewell T. that there are times when the -- that it's not the form of the -- of the agreement that is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.435" offset="25285151">It's the impact of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.425" offset="25293093">And here, the impact of the union's regulations upon the leader is to preserve the wage standards of the employees, the stipulated employees on this record, the sidemen and the sub-leaders, these -- this was stipulated that these people are employees and the critical aspect of the union's regulation is an attempt to preserve those wage standards against diminution by a leader who works at an amount less than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="6347.394" offset="25492982">Let's assume that here's a leader that doesn't play no instrument whatsoever and he's a professional leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.858" offset="25514820">And then, the thing of it is that he has two engagements at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.067" offset="25535613">Now, he hires a leader, a sub-leader to take one off him and the other one is leading himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6366.703" offset="25570200">Now, what interest does the union get in saying that the leader's compensation in the -- on the engagement where he's conducting himself should be twice that of what the sub-leader's compensation is?</text>
