            <text syncTime="52.353" offset="312822">I feel that the facts in this case are decisive to all of the issues which I am attempting to raise and I will discuss them at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.507" offset="353364">I expect also to discuss the need for an adequate standard to measure the effectiveness and duty of Court appointed trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.073" offset="395682">I also expect to discuss some suggested standards with particular emphasis on the American Bar Association's minimum standards for criminal justice and lastly of course to discuss the existing precedent as it applies to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.552" offset="469556">As to the facts, the defendant at the time of his arrest was 17 years old, he is white, of average to above average in intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.542" offset="529533">He has a tenth grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.777" offset="542490">He and his family at the time of his arrest resided in California, so that when he was apprehended near West Palm Beach, he was out without of either a counsel or family.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.985" offset="715316">I feel that the failure to present such testimony Your Honor is one of the indications to show that trial counsel completely abandoned all defenses that were applicable so far as the question of mercy was concerned Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.274" offset="796505">The defendant at the time of his arrest immediately confessed to an additional seven homicides all committed in the perpetration of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.840" offset="850735">All of these homicides were committed within the period of 30 days; one in California, three I believe in Arizona and four in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.955" offset="891173">The four that were in committed in South Florida were all committed within that past week.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.868" offset="914892">The defendant as I say was apprehended in West Palm Beach and immediately the next day on March 6th of 1960 he was taken to Miami where he again repeated these confessions to these eight separate homicides, this time Your Honors in the presence of television cameras, radio microphones and of course the news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.314" offset="1016665">The defendant was returned to West Palm Beach in May where he was convicted and given a recommendation of mercy which in Florida is automatically means life.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.607" offset="1273814">Their opinions ran the range that he was suffering from a mere personality disorder to the fact that he had a severe psychosis, that is almost out of touch with reality, although still able to know right from wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.729" offset="1338284">The psychiatrist who had not been formally appointed two weeks before his trial filed his report and this psychiatrist said I can state unequivocally that without further advances in the psychiatric field this boy will a menace to society as long as he may live.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.310" offset="1412577">Counsel were asked by the petitioner to move for a change of venue, but they failed to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.550" offset="10937553">Marshall v. United States was a case where trial was in progress and they sequestered or they broke through the night recessed and there was evidence in Marshall prior records or convictions of the defendant which would not be admissible and the trial judge in Marshall took each of the jurors into his chambers and asked them will you disregard this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.053" offset="11035564">And each of the Juror said certainly we will and we will base our record on the evidence, base our verdict on the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.636" offset="11073912">I feel that the reasoning in Irvin versus Dowd, Mr. Justice Black is that sometimes when things can be so bad that regardless of presence or absence of what a juror says that the case has to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.768" offset="11142457">We've got Rideau versus Louisiana standing for that and certainly Turner versus Louisiana, a case where the jury was taken out by the two of the witnesses over the deputy sheriffs, as [Inaudible] v. Texas everyone said that they were going to be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.148" offset="11227930">So the fact Mr. Justice Black that there was no evidence actually introduced as Court noted in Marshall versus United States at least when you introduce evidence you have some protective proceeding but if the evidence is not introduced and everyone knows about it anyway there are no protective procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="3843.174" offset="15476067">Well Mr. Justice my position is simply that no evidentiary hearing is necessary if, I assume and I am positive that in Florida or that in the Federal courts under 2255 a motion to vacate a judgment and sentence is handled the same way it is in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.904" offset="15578990">The trial Court Judge reads the motion and he determines from the motion that the ground A, B and C are frivolous, but ground D, if true would require an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.146" offset="15647953">Now at this point the judge then turns to the record and I might add this judge was the same judge, he was a trial court judge, he then turns to the record and examines this and if ground D is not conclusively refuted by the record then he must grant an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.558" offset="15741576">So I suppose that I could very accurately I hope in answer to your question by saying that the record of the voir dire in the case at Bar conclusively refutes the petitioner's allegation insofar as he alleges that he was denied a fair trial by reason of adverse pretrial publicity, even if we assume that its all true as he say it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="5396.017" offset="21687463">No, they did not other than as I stated before they quoted something from the Supreme Court opinion as to the effectiveness of counsel but that's a rather tangential holding I would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.959" offset="21743156">Now, I can -- as I say I can't get inside of the defense counsel's head but I can see why defense counsel would not have put on the psychiatric testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.641" offset="21793938">All you have to do is look at psychiatric testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.011" offset="21815463">First of all, I believe it will open the door to the fact this man had killed six other people and shot another one who happened to live four times in the head, look at page 23 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.865" offset="21858826">I can't think of anything more damming to have in evidence and that's seems to me a very good reason for deciding not use this type of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.663" offset="21894040">I don't know why defense counsel did not request a certain instruction, I'm not even sure that he didn't but I would think that if I were defense counsel that I might not want the jury put on notice again that there had been all this pretrial publicity that this fellow must be a real bad guy, I just wouldn't want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.695" offset="22002186">I think I might be very happy to go trial and take my chances on the Court's standard instruction as to evidence heard from the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.295" offset="22040534">And again back to the change of venue, I think that counsel after being requested by his client, this defendant to move for a change venue that this decision was up to defense counsel and he made the decision at some time during the voir dire examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.749" offset="22134366">I think it is apparent from the voir dire examination that at some point defense counsel decided that, you know this looks like a pretty good jury to me, let's go to trial, let's hear it on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.934" offset="22187133">And as I say I've cited Nelson as being the controlling case on this issue, I'd like to -- they're talking about it doesn't make any difference as to whose decision is as to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.736" offset="22250350">Now of course Nelson wanted to object to allegedly unlawful search and seizure and the Court held, well this was the decision for counsel not the defendant to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.412" offset="22304998">And that counsel's decision is binding on the defendant except for in unusual circumstances which they feel is fine and so the Court says now this is the same situation as Whitney had.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.304" offset="22368632">Nelson had asked his defense counsel object to that testimony, object to this evidence and the counsel refused to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.562" offset="22405622">And so the Court then says does the fact here that there was prior consultation with the accused and that he disagreed with counsel's strategy make a legal difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.506" offset="22453373">The question is not in before the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.746" offset="22466330">Our view is that the result should be the same meaning that it did not make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.389" offset="22488900">So I submit gentlemen that the issue of the adverse pretrial publicity is controlled is by the voir dire examination and that these decision – decisions be made solely by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5612.934" offset="22555146">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5647.476" offset="22693282">Fay and Noia was a case where he had to take in a direct appeal, the Court of Appeals of New York held for that reason the post conviction remedy of coram nobus was not open to him under state law and I read this as saying no more and for our failure to request the change the venue, your 2255 counterpart was not open to him as a matter of state law and in either case the answer is that the proper forum for your client is Federal habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="5805.032" offset="23323460">Yes Your Honors this -- these were the assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.180" offset="23336103">The only order that the trial court entered was saying that this was res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.674" offset="23354075">This is the only thing the trial judge did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.530" offset="23361494">The trial judge made no finding of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="5817.107" offset="23371839">There was no question of waiver presented in the apartment of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.526" offset="23389497">The trial judge said res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.591" offset="23409768">Now one last, so I feel Your Honors that there is a Federal right here that the state court has – excuse me I see that my time is expired.</text>

            <text syncTime="5843.157" offset="23476015">So in one last, one last comment, the voir dire is still certainly and effective means to determine the fairness of a trial and I don't ever concede that it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.704" offset="23522200">But I say this Your Honors that in this case the jury was not given the proper tools by which they should perform their function and their function in this trial was to determine whether or not mercy should have been extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.007" offset="23583431">So far as this function was concerned I don't believe that the jury were given the proper tools to do their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.221" offset="23612270">I feel that this Court does have jurisdiction that the adequate state ground that is troubling some of the Justices was a ruling on a Federal ground that is of the publicity which of course is a Federal question.</text>
