            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Liberman</label>
            <text syncTime="36.468" offset="250316">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.618" offset="266825">This case arises on a petition for certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on a judgment which simply affirmed a holding by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri dismissing the amended complaint in these actions for failure to state the cause of action upon which relief can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.786" offset="363583">Therefore, the facts which are well pleaded in the First Amendment complaints set out in the appendix are the facts which we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.437" offset="398169">These facts alleged that the respondents, a group of related corporations and one individual or developers of a subdivision known Paddock Woods in St. Louis County, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.681" offset="451145">They also are developers of adjacent subdivisions known as Paddock Estates, Paddock Meadows, Paddock Hills, and Wedgwood and perhaps some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.735" offset="495344">They received permission from various estate agencies to build these divisions including Paddock Woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.531" offset="526482">They layout the streets and the sewers and the recreation facilities and various other facilities and then they plot out certain lots and they sell houses and lots to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.088" offset="580712">The method of selling is by buildings and display houses of different types on the -- at the location of the subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.989" offset="616344">And then the public looks at the display house and the buyer, if he likes one of the houses, will enter into a contract by which the respondents will build a certain house according to the choice of the buyer on a certain lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.177" offset="673081">And when it's completed, the transfer of the property is then made.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.788" offset="695547">It's further alleged that the estate in the various governmental subdivisions of the estate are involved with the building of the subdivision both in the approval and the assistance which they give to the builder and from the standpoint of the function -- community functions which they delegate to the builder with respect to the government of this community.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.409" offset="790006">The facts out of this case in particular arose from Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Jones, the petitioners went out to the subdivision and saw a house which they wanted to buy and attempted buy it, and it is alleged that the respondents refused to deal with them or to sell them a house solely because Mr. Jones is a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.100" offset="876837">The question presented has led to certain refusal solely because of the raise of the prospective buyer is in violation of the law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.933" offset="924170">In our brief, this question took two forms, firstly, whether the conduct is prohibited by Section 1978 of the revised statutes 42 U.S.C., Section 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.986" offset="988327">Secondly, whether regardless of the statute on the particular facts of the case due to the nature of the subdivision, the developer would be barred from discriminating in excluding Negroes even without a statute because of the amount of state action which would be involved in the building of the subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.097" offset="1068784">Also in our brief, we broke down the question concerning the statute into its interpretation and as to whether if interpreted as barring this kind of conduct by developer whether that would be a constitutional -- constitutionally valid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.757" offset="1135449">Actually, it has been conceded by the respondents that such interpretation would be constitutional and in fact the court below, the Court of Appeals, Judge Blackmun held in his opinion there was a matter of interpretation of the statute rather than a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.444" offset="1206188">So, addressing my first -- myself first to the statutory question rather than the constitutional question, we think that the statute by its plain terms bars a builder of a private subdivision from excluding persons from buying and living in that subdivision because of their race.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.833" offset="1303677">Your Honor, that question is not before the Court in this case because --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="303.799" stopTime="306.151">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="303.799" offset="1319560">That's your view of the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_h_liberman" startTime="306.151" stopTime="709.867">
            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Liberman</label>
            <text syncTime="306.151" offset="1328964">In my view of the statute, it would apply to an individual house owner as well but of course that and we have here a subdivision developer in which bar make it much broader type of exclusion as it's pointed out in the brief of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.021" offset="1400435">The question concerning the interpretation can be looked at from the standpoint of the history and from a standpoint of what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.677" offset="1439096">The history of the statute is set out at length in the brief filed by the respondents and there's more of it set out in the petitioner's brief, in the amicus brief filed by the United States and in the amicus filed by the group of organizations and by the National Committee against Discrimination in Housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.776" offset="1519449">We think that the history, it shows abundant awareness on the part of the drafters of this law but it would apply to individual action as well as to action only by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.944" offset="1564170">The -- although there are some mentioned in the debates concerning this law of the problem of state action looked at in the historical standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.669" offset="1623103">I do not think you can interpret it as meaning that would only cover state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.095" offset="1640761">In other words, the Congress at that time was concerned with state action from the standpoint that they have no doubt under the accepted constitutional doctrine in the McCulloch versus Maryland and Prigg versus Pennsylvania that they can do what they wished with respect to controlling the conduct of individuals in violation of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.197" offset="1733235">They were concerned what would happen when the individuals might have some federal legislation on our position to state legislation either permitting or in some cases requiring discriminatory conduct and for this reason, the debates did at times focused on the question of state action and it was resolved that the state law would have to give way to the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.784" offset="1839501">Nevertheless, there's very little in the debates, there's very little even in the quotations of respondent's brief on pages 16 to 19 from which you can make the negative entrance because they were covering what the states might do, they didn't intend to cover what individuals might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.403" offset="1914002">The -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.263" offset="1929467">Regardless, the -- how you that you can't tell what was in the mind of every member of Congress, the debate was certainly lengthy in the interpretation of the statute as applying to individuals was brought out often enough that we can assume that the Congress was aware of the issue and dealt carefully in the language which it chose to adopt to say what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.761" offset="2031449">Now, this statute, originally the Civil Rights Act of 1866 is set out in full of the appendix of petitioner's brief, and looking at the language you might know that the first place has entitled an act to protect all persons in United States in these Civil Rights and furnish the means of their vindication.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.938" offset="2116190">It's not entitled an act to prevent the states from discriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.902" offset="2131968">It's a positively worded act in its title and in its language itself which has boiled down in Section 1982, it's just of all citizens of the United States shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoined by white citizens thereof to inherit purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.250" offset="2225382">It -- the language emphasizes not the -- what the states may not do and doesn't even refer to that but rather what the right of an individual citizen who wishes to buy and hold property is.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.967" offset="2284314">Furthermore, it goes further not even talking about the right itself but the enjoyment of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.048" offset="2304585">So, that it would seem from the language itself that we would have to come to the conclusion that they meant that this was not meant to be nearly some sort of negative restriction on what the states or anyone else might do but was supposed to set forth the enjoyment that the right to which people, particularly Negroes, have the right to enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.126" offset="2436869">The statute in question has not received a great deal of interpretation particularly in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.539" offset="2474590">In fact, the only case that really directly deals with these interpretations of the statute is in the case of United States versus Morris which is a District Court case and an old case but it upholds the interpretation of the statute what we would give to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.897" offset="2540001">As far as the decisions of this Court, the statute has been referred to collaterally in such cases of Buchanan versus Warley and Oyama versus California but it doesn't mention any limiting aspect of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.239" offset="2617323">And there are some other decisions notably the dictum in Hurd versus Hodge which would limit perhaps, from which the limitation can be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.730" offset="2659328">We feel that this limitation is not -- have it by way of dictum comes in conflict with the earlier cases dealing with the statute which don't see any implication limiting the statute to state action and which do -- the fact, the earlier cases with respect to other reconstruction Civil Rights legislation, almost all of them refused to make any such interpretation even though in some cases it might have saved the constitutionality of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.921" offset="2800076">Furthermore, to the extent that there is any such implied limitation by Hurd versus Hodge, we think that it will resolve more from a constitutional feeling of the Court at that time that there was some constitutional limitation on the statute rather than what the statute was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.002" offset="2872383">And in the holdings of this Court in the Katzenbach versus Morgan and United States versus Price and the Guest case, this limiting constitutional interpretation of the power of Congress under the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5 has been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.817" offset="2939674">So that any --</text>

            <label>Mr. Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="1577.150" offset="6413019">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.196" offset="6445202">The United States has asked for this opportunity appears friend of the court because of its very great concern that the rights here involved be fully secured and fulfilled for all of our people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.053" offset="6528585">The questions presented are whether the Fourteenth Amendment or Section 1978 of the revised statutes prohibit a developer of a large suburban community from refusing to sell homes within that community to Negroes solely on account of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.125" offset="6628895">Our concern with these issues arises from the fact that it is the experience of this decade that of all discriminations, the most harmful in and of itself and in its reinforcement of other discriminations is the discrimination that has caused segregation in our living which is primarily discrimination in the sale of housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.501" offset="6778420">Segregate living makes it seems almost impossible in fulfillment of rights secured by the Constitution such as schooling, where in the first five years of this decade, we have witnessed in major metropolitan school districts a vast increase in percentage of Negro students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.655" offset="6895031">As an illustration, Chicago has risen from 40% to 52% Negro in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.442" offset="6922198">In Baltimore, the figure has risen from 50% to 61%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.062" offset="6944664">In Saint Louis, the principal city in the area from which this case comes, Negro school population in public schools had risen from 49% to 60%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.995" offset="6984370">These arise in large measure because of segregation in housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.785" offset="7011537">It's not just in schooling, it's in communications, people in these isolated and alienated areas can hardly be communicated with by itenerants or others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.537" offset="7062528">It must be reached our people who lived among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.508" offset="7078410">Same as true to the employment, for vital government services of recreation and of health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.468" offset="7110280">The present very substantial and growing urban segregation is caused and maintained in major part by discrimination in sales of housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.602" offset="7150822">Between 1950 and 1960, nonwhite families in unsound urban housing increased 25% from 1.4 million to 1.8 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.591" offset="7218740">In this same decade, nonwhite families and overcrowded urban housing increased 40% from 700,000 to a million families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.990" offset="7268373">Among those families earning $10,000 or more a year, 15% of the nonwhite families live in substandard housing compared to 3.7% for white families of comparable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.951" offset="7340157">In 1960, 46% of our nonwhite urban population lived in unsound housing compared to 14% for the whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.737" offset="7391357">I would like to devote my argument primarily to the constitutional issue that in anyway indicating that the United States does not have full confidence that the conduct here involved was prohibited as well by Section 1978 for Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.998" offset="7492399">The history of the Fourteenth Amendment clearly reveals that a basic purpose of that Amendment was securing full rights to own, use and dispose of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.282" offset="7573483">The first Section of the Civil Rights Act of 19 -- of 1866 was this statute that we're dealing with today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.839" offset="7615801">Contemporaneous with its enactment by the same session of the same Congress, the Congress sent the Fourteenth Amendment to the people for ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.775" offset="7655508">It was concerned at that time that the property rights sought to be secured by the statute enacted that year to be preserved also by constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.379" offset="7705872">This, have been recognized in the early Slaughter-House Cases as well in Shay -- in Shelley v. Kraemer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.039" offset="7728546">The rights of the property were looked upon is precondition to nearly all other rights into their exercise and perhaps the most fundamental of our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.997" offset="7772432">The Fourteenth Amendment by its own force condemns this discrimination because of the involvement of the states in its effectuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.523" offset="7830528">As early as 1917 in Buchanan v. Warley, the Supreme Court stuck -- or struck a statute, the City of Louisville an ordinance, which restricted the sale of property within a city block to a member of the black race or the white race if his race was not a majority within that block.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.355" offset="7937839">This was before a separate and equal doctrine was disapproved in such areas of schooling in transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.568" offset="7986636">But here, the potential for fencing out is much greater than the statute or that ordinance struck in the Buchanan case which reached only a city block.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.913" offset="8028014">Here, the potential is to hundred of thousands of single family dwellings built within major subdivisions in the United States each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.526" offset="8066466">A major part of our new housing market setting at the very beginning, a pattern of discrimination that can be assume and will persist for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.105" offset="8116830">The fact of the conduct of respondents here is just fully contrary to the public interest, that was the affect of the ordinance of the City of Louisville, restricted in Buchanan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.905" offset="8184017">And it is as much the state acting as was the act of the city there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.205" offset="8213170">In Shelley v. Kraemer in 1948, this Court held that the state cannot enforce private agreements to restrict the sale of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.957" offset="8272206">There, only a handful of properties need be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.886" offset="8303971">I believe in the record in that case there were 21 separate property ownerships placed under the restrictive covenant that was stricken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.225" offset="8353290">Here, again the fencing out of the Negro is much greater and the action of the state in supporting and enabling and giving the opportunity to the developer to bring this about ever been that great is the involvement of the Court in Shelley v. Kraemer or it was sought to enforce a restrictive covenant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.268" offset="8545447">I'm not aware of any such evidence or implication in the record to that effect Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.429" offset="8594139">In Evans v. Newton in 1966, this Court held that services rendered by a private board of trustees and providing a park service pursuant to the will of Senator Bacon of Georgia, in Macon, Georgia where municipal in nature and that this mere park service was so impregnated with government activity that state action was involved in discrimination in the use of the park was prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.191" offset="8777206">Here, in Paddock Woods, their parks, tennis courts, bathing facilities, all of which will be subject to the restriction against race that is created for this entire suburban community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.116" offset="8860902">In Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority in 1961, the Court in viewing all of the circumstances of the financing and construction of a parking lot in Wilmington and the provision thereof -- by lease from an estate of a private restaurant, held that the state was involved in the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.941" offset="8956197">Even though the restaurant there under those circumstances was operated and maintained by private company and in perhaps the most important and closely relevant case, in Marsh v. Alabama in 1946, the Supreme Court held that a company town, which was owned by Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, built presumably for furthering the purposes of that corporation in building ships, could not limit the exercise of constitutional rights within that town merely because of the combination of property interest that it there owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.305" offset="9145637">Far less extensive, in our present environment is the company town compared to the subdivision developments with which we're here confronted which make up perhaps most of new suburbia which surrounds our central city ghettos where so many of our minorities are confined and unable regardless of their economic ability to break loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.834" offset="9279697">The pattern of segregation created in these subdivisions will have exactly the same effect that it would have if they were created by act of a legislature or by act of a city council.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.502" offset="9362453">In regardless of the ownership of the property involved, the public interest must be identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.666" offset="9387112">Here, Paddock Woods is legally indistinguishable from the company of town in Chickasaw, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.096" offset="9428804">It has to go to government, the county government of Saint Louis, the state government of Missouri for all of its powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.774" offset="9483452">It could not provide what it provides for the people without the approval, without the responsibility of state government in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.057" offset="9532667">It must provide to the people their streets, sidewalks, water, sewage, park facilities as indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.568" offset="9570701">It has the power under municipal ordinance of the County of Saint Louis to provide the zoning restrictions through deeds of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.830" offset="9611766">And the nature of these restrictions by usage, and as can be seen from the ordinance itself, go even to noxious conduct of the people resident in the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.058" offset="10728657">The Court held in Marsh v. Alabama that a Jehovah's Witness could not be prohibited because of the Equal Protection Clause for the Fourteenth Amendment from going into a company town that was concededly private property from going on the sidewalks there and endeavoring to communicate with the people who live there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.082" offset="10848716">And if -- and the Court held that the mere fact that this was private property that this is a company of town or rather than ordinary city could not deprive the inhabitants there of their constitutional rights to this sort of communications or the rights of people who did not live there to come there and so communicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.041" offset="10928546">It would seem ironic indeed if this communication could not be prohibited, this casual itenerant communication, but that the very right, the fundamental right to live there, to buy there, to own property there could be prohibited as to the whole area fencing out an entire race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.820" offset="11035648">This would seem to me that if its government action within the limits of the property of the company town in Chickasaw, Alabama, for purposes of Jehovah's Witnesses coming on the sidewalks that are private property, then it must be government action also for that corporation and the disposition of its property when it endeavors to restrict its sales to people of the white race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.815" offset="11171694">The activities of the city in Marsh v. Alabama are not essentially different from the activities of this suburban community.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.152" offset="11361029">We would urge to the Court to hold that when a subdivision in a community involving these many people, alleged to be a thousand people in Paddock Woods alone, in a total development of 2,700 families endeavors to screen out, to fence out all Negroes that it is denying equal protection of the laws in a fundamentally governmental activity violating constitutional rights of the person so-discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.008" offset="11524451">The statute itself, Section 1978 is in the broadest of language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.481" offset="11618283">The language designed to prevent the discrimination against Negroes, and the sale and the use and the disposition of property, and if they can be screened out from the whole area here, a whole community involving hundreds of families, then clearly they are denied the rights the statute was designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.300" offset="11725594">The fact that the statute played partially dormant for many years, it cannot be held to diminish its force today any more than Sections 241 and 242, enacted shortly after this were diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.030" offset="11812530">When it first came before the Court in U.S. v. Classic after 75 years of virtual dormancy, the statute is vital and it's important.</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.261" offset="13213424">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.957" offset="13232232">I have a -- so we've got seven minutes left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.512" offset="13246443">I don't know just where to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.056" offset="13256579">The Court has already touched through its questioning on what I believe are some of the most sensitive areas in this entire case especially the questions directed by Mr. Justice White at the very end which I think clearly indicate the profound complications and the very troublesome problems and difficulties that will arise inevitably if this Court should construe Section 1982 as the petitioners and the government and the amici wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.019" offset="13420523">I, speaking of the amici, may it please the Court in the few minutes that I have left, I should like to make few general observations as Your Honors have probably observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.584" offset="13478724">There are great many amici briefs that have been filed in this case in support of the petitioners and I must confess that when these briefs started coming to my office I was not a little shaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.961" offset="13524281">And it wasn't -- it wasn't because -- I was disturbed over the fact that with all these many organizations and fine lawyers on one side, I was being left in a somewhat friendless position in this courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.191" offset="13589170">I've become sort of accustomed to that back home where even some of my good friends were beginning to look upon me as if I had suddenly become afflicted with leprosy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.083" offset="13636712">What disturbed me, may it please the Court, what gave me real concern was how I was suppose to deal with all of these good briefs and they are excellent briefs especially the two that have been mentioned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.902" offset="13700033">The -- I'm talking now but the amici briefs, one by the government and the other by group of national organizations headed by one that calls itself the National Committee against Discrimination in Housing, which I shall refer to as I have in my brief as the NCADH brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.276" offset="13785506">And speaking of that brief, may it please the Court, with reference to the statements made by the honorable Attorney General, in regard to the effect that segregation, racial segregation has had upon the life of our country, I want to say here and now, personally I bow to nobody when it comes to concern over the plight of the disadvantaged Negro family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.400" offset="13926045">And may I have this, I have read many articles and books on this subject, but as I told the person who I believe was the principal writer of the NCADH brief, I have now seen anywhere a more powerful, a more eloquent description of the terrible -- the terrible condition in plight in which not only the children but the adults of the Negro families find themselves by reason of their difficulty in obtaining decent housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.986" offset="14064389">So that as to that part of the Attorney General's argument, as far as that part is concern, I assure the Court that I do not quarrel either with the Attorney General or with any of these good friends of the Court who come into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.870" offset="14139831">What disturbs me, Your Honors, is the way in which they think this problem should be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.962" offset="14180268">And I must say, since I will have only a minute, as I came into the courtroom this morning for the first time, I saw the words that are inscribed over the portals of this courthouse “equal justice under law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.431" offset="14250172">I must confess my ignorance, I did not know those words were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.080" offset="14268667">And it struck me that this perhaps goes to the very heart of this case surely nobody would deny equal justice under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or under Section 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.291" offset="14341601">But the other two words are just as important, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.276" offset="14357483">It must be under law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.219" offset="14369290">I happen to be a practicing lawyer back home and not a lawyer who assure you, Your Honors, professors to have any great knowledge about constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.511" offset="14414430">I happen to be what people referred to as the bread and butter type of practicing lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.981" offset="14444314">And while I have that deep sympathy for the conditions that have been described caused by the acute problems of housing, I am also a practicing lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.779" offset="14495514">I have an equal reverence for the orderliness of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.528" offset="14522472">And I believe Your Honors that if we are to meet this problem, let us meet it in a way that it's provided for under our Constitution and under our philosophy of the meaning of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.068" offset="14580673">It's 2:30 and if I may I should like to close and reserve my time unless the Court wishes to ask me questions.</text>
