            <text syncTime="2346.487" offset="9491372">I think that, and in the Peters case where the burglary suspect was brought from the fifth floor landing up to the sixth floor, I think this is a very limited type of detention which doesn't include the handcuffs, the cell bars, the booking and the crowded police station and that is not needed and it's not authorized by the New York cases or the Court of Appeals cases and the statute in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.066" offset="11849707">Our response to questioning yesterday stems from our doubt as to this Court's power to except one District Attorney's concession that the New York Court of Appeals erred not once but twice in holding that it's own statute applied to this case and also from our conviction that the non-bailable petty offenders of New York should be able to rely not only on the conscience of one man in a busy District Attorney's office to see that they get justice, but on the entire judicial system of the State of New York especially where the consent is not upon the New York Courts within its own Court system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.574" offset="12167670">May it please the Court, this cause is before the Court today on direct appeal from a judgment of the New York State Court of Appeals, which judgment confirmed the defendant's conviction for the illegal possession of burglar's tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.283" offset="12230572">On this appeal, the defendant contends that a certain search of this person and the seizure of evidence there from constituted an unreasonable search and seizure of his person in violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.621" offset="12315941">In this case, as in the Sibron case, the validity of a state statute, namely Section 180 (a) of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure has been drawn into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.929" offset="12361185">Additionally there have been raised in this case broad questions, which concern the rights of our citizenry to move about freely without undue police interference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.522" offset="12455539">The appellant was arrested in the City of Mount Vernon in New York on July 10, 1964 at or about 1 pm on that day by a man by the name of Lasky who at that time was a police officer attached to the Police Department of the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.372" offset="12526905">On a preliminary hearing in the City of Mount Vernon, officer Lasky testified that at the time in question he resided in the six-floor apartment of a very large multiple dwelling, located in the City of Mount Vernon and that approximately at 1 pm on that day he had finished taking a shower, or he was in the process of taking a shower, when he heard some noise outside of his apartment door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.759" offset="12632440">He testified that he went to the peephole of his apartment door, looked out and then he saw two men whom he did not recognize, tiptoeing to the common hallway of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.086" offset="12677789">Then his testimony was that he made a telephone call and that he put some clothing on, again looked through the peephole of the door, saw these two men in the common hallway tiptoeing and that he left his apartment with his drawn service revolver in hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="5425.427" offset="21807167">In this particular case, the unworkability of the standard of reasonable suspicion is clearly demonstrated by the fact that -- if by no other fact then in the Sibron case the Court of Appeals of the State of New York felt there was reasonable suspicion, the attorneys involved in that case did not, and the Kings County District Attorney office at this late date decide that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.118" offset="21909880">The unworkability and the harm to be perceived statute like that is in fact that a man like Sibron can do six months in jail, I hold no brief in narcotics people, when -- he wasn't sent there according to law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5711.160" offset="22950076">In those situations absent probable cause in the traditional sense, he ought not have a right to search the man or the suspect for the simple reason as I view the construction of the statute as we have it now for example in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.104" offset="23021861">The unworkability of it is illustrated that by decision it is implied that in every case the police officer is going to have to fear for his life because as Judge Keating said the answer to a question maybe a bullet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5743.103" offset="23077867">So if that's the position, it would seem to me that at least in New York and I don't hypothesize in what statute might be drawn that would be a better statute but at least in New York the situation is as I read these cases that on every occasion that a police officer stops someone, he has to frisk him because -- or search him because he presumes that he is in danger because he maybe -- the answer to the question may be a bullet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.262" offset="23194478">Well if this low level of causation or search, just restricted to the subjective operations of a police officer's mind other than for example a situation where there is a noticeable bulge or a suspect does some overt act where he reaches into his pocket and the police officer reasonably suspects or has probable cause, a set of phrases you want to apply that he is about to withdraw a revolver and use at the police officer or a knife, I think if you would hit the standard as you have in New York my answer today, my answer will have to be a no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.535" offset="23347555">If they are more workable, a more definitive standard can be worked out, then I say the answer is a, we have to judge in the light of requirements for a Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="6547.896" offset="26296989">A stolen car for example I should assume yes that it would be done on a routine preordained basis because a policeman is to be expected to be able to see a stolen car.</text>
            <text syncTime="6558.275" offset="26338471">I have heard a great many people say here that is the subjective determination of the officer and I would like to answer that point because I just cannot believe that this Court is prepared to decide that what a police officer decides on the streets is the very last word in the point, because the fact that we stand here this morning debating the reasonableness of what Samuel L. Lasky did in the hallway of a public building in Mount Vernon in July of 1964 certainly gives the lie to any suggestion that the policeman is the final arbiter of the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6602.663" offset="26516104">By reason of this Court's determination in Mapp against Ohio and Miranda against Arizona, New York has now developed, something they never had before, a workable, practical daily routine whereby the admissibility of evidence prior to a trial is decided upon and passed upon as a legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.184" offset="26618190">There's nothing so amorphous as reasonable grounds for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.948" offset="26641178">So if you're going to rely on a policeman's capacity to decide what is reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been committed, I see no reason for withdrawing from him, the acumen to decide when there's reasonable ground to suspect because on the following morning, a court will convene some place in that jurisdiction who will pass on whether or not this officer had these reasonable grounds to suspect.</text>

            <text syncTime="6774.711" offset="27204274">The other hundreds of people who are stopped and frisked, nothing has found and where many of them are innocent people, never will reach the courts unless you have a suit for damages or of threats some thing of that kind and I think it's almost impossible to find a situation where the police are curtailed in anyway by such actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="7655.291" offset="30726625">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court and in these few minutes I want to make specific if I can an argument which I think has informed the general discussion that which I can't believe has been put in haec verba.</text>
            <text syncTime="7674.216" offset="30802275">The Fourth Amendment is the historical product of the experiences of the colonists with the minions of King George who would walk into a man's home and rummage among his papers and who when they went into his home had the express purpose of finding evidence on the basis of which he could be arrested, convicted, and imprisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7704.377" offset="30922961">And the language of the Fourth Amendment with its two clauses one prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure and the other restricting the right to search to search warrants that is to search is made upon severely restricted warrants, pictures this historic genesis of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7734.135" offset="31041975">Now -- and this Court has had occasion before to enlarge the scope of search permitted even under the restricted language, the restrictive language of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7749.972" offset="31105296">One of the justices pointed out in the history of this Court that you could search in vain in the Fourth Amendment for the right to search as an incident to a lawful arrest itself based on probable cause and yet ex necessitate because conditions required if this Court laid down this, or may I say engrafted upon the Fourth Amendment, this exception which cannot be found in the language of the Fourth Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="7789.602" offset="31263807">Just because the purpose of the search and in this agreement which some of my colleagues I believe New York has authorized a full search in the Taggart case just because the purpose of the search is not to procure evidence upon which to convict a man, but is solely for the purpose of protecting the officer in the performance of his obligatory public duty and his very necessary public duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7825.605" offset="31407794">The standard of probable cause can be relaxed because the purpose of the search is not the historically prohibited purpose of entrapping a man and out of his own effects and papers convicting him.</text>

            <text syncTime="7849.688" offset="31504133">And since this is so, the standard I say maybe less than probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="7857.245" offset="31534435">Now it has been objected here that probable cause is an amorphous standard, something you can't, -- I mean reasonable suspicion is something which cannot be measured, it cannot be weighed but by the same token probable cause cannot be lineally measured or quantitatively weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7880.493" offset="31627431">It has to be hammered out on the anvil of the experience and litigation from case-to-case until there will arise or be created or there will emerge a standard of reasonable suspicion such as this Court was able to do in the Brinegar case about probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="7971.899" offset="31993041">There is an analogy I think here with an arrest based on probable cause, a search incidental to that arrest, that search is permitted for a weapon in order to safeguard the officer for the means of instrumentalities with which that crime was committed or for the fruits of that crime and yet if the search is based upon an incidental to unlawful arrest and it turns up some contraband completely independent of the fruits or instrumentalities of the crime with relation to which the search was originally made the defendant can be prosecuted for that.</text>
