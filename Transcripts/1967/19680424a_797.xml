            <label>Mr. Harry C. Ames, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.808" offset="138637">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.429" offset="153057">I represent in 797, the Waterways Freight Bureau and the Regulated Barge Lines party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.791" offset="198510">The Commission in this proceeding having found that the proposed rail rate to be above rail out-of-pocket cost and therefore compensatory, it addressed itself to the real issue or problem in this case that of its power under Section 15a(3) of the Act to the determination by comparison of costs which mode, rail or water, possess the inherent advantage of low costs and whether that advantage, if it lay with the water carriers, would be impelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.770" offset="354408">It was no longer the simple problem of whether the rail rate standing in issue by itself was profitable rate to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.329" offset="392652">This must be borne in mind in consideration of the method and approach used by the Commission in reaching its determinations of who is the low cost carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.665" offset="438000">This is an effort by the Interstate Commerce Commission to ascertain which mode of carriage should be permitted in the public interest, not in the interest of the proponent mode alone to continue to participate in the transportation in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.822" offset="510621">This proceeding is an outgrowth of the long line of cases reaching back some 40 years and more in which the water carriers have been forced to fight rail rate reductions designed to pick off vital tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.964" offset="575195">The precise rate in question in this ingot molds case became effective March 19, 1965, almost immediately following the decision by the division of the Commission which was issued in February 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.231" offset="652309">The Commission found that this tonnage, ingot molds is a part of a group embracing iron and steel products which group is a third most important commodity group transported in barge line service.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.986" offset="723362">It, the group, represents 11% of the barge line revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.873" offset="750843">It is one of only 11 groups of tonnage which account for 81.45% of the total barge revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.419" offset="793057">The Commission fully understood in fully mandated statements that the traffic is of more consequence to the barge lines than to the railroads and it was dealing with a railroad concept that would not only impair the ability of the water carriers to compete but to actually exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.919" offset="887097">The barge lines in this case introduced evidence to prove and did prove that their inherent advantage of low cost would be impaired by this rate set at a level below the barge line fully distributed cost, that barge lines went one step further and proved that their inherent advantage could be destroyed by the ability in the railroads to take such a step with respect of only a few groups of commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.960" offset="1011231">This evidence in this case was directed to the language of this Court in the New Haven case where at page 78, it was said the principal reason for the reference to Section 15a(3) as the hearing shown was to emphasize the power of the Commission to prevent the railroad from destroying or impairing the inherent advantages of other modes and the precise example given to the Senate Committee which led to the language adopted was a case in which the railroads by establishing on a part of their operations a compensatory rate below their fully distributed cost forced a smaller, competing, lower cost mode to go below its own fully distributed cost and thus perhaps to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.191" offset="1244139">This conclusion was reiterated by this Court at page 759 in the same decision where it was discussing unfair or destructive competitive practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.347" offset="1300773">So the test before the Commission in ingot molds was not solely as the rail proponents would have us believe determined whether the rate was profitable to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.976" offset="1343300">The test was the issue of intermodal competition under Section 15a(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="316.833" offset="1370676">First the division and secondly the Commission addressed themselves completely to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.186" offset="1400142">Vital findings of fact of the division and adopted by the Commission were first that the proposed rate was above rail out-of-pocket cost and therefore compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.751" offset="1442356">Second, that the barge's fully distributed costs were below such cost by the rails.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.940" offset="1467120">Third, that the proposed rate was below the rail's fully distributed cost and that the proposed rate was below the barge's fully distributed cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.005" offset="2743359">Now, these facts in this ingot molds case set forth precisely the problem discussed in the New Haven case an attempt by the high cost carrier by going below its fully distributed cost to force the low cost carrier to go below its fully distributed cost to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.464" offset="2829249">Now, at the time that the ingot molds case was being tried before the Commission and at the time that the New Haven case was still before the courts, the Commission had before the case involving the movement of grain and in that case, the Commission referring to the New Haven case in the pendency of the issues pointed out that it was -- its -- part of its duty in the Grain case to consider which method of cost would be used in determining this question of an inherent cost advantage and it addressed itself directly to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.815" offset="2998627">And in the Grain case, it came up with the general rule that when regulated carriers were involved in an intermodal competitive situation such as we have in the Grain case, the Commission would use fully distributed cost for the purpose of measuring the inherent cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.221" offset="3088280">Now, in the ingot molds case, both the division and the full Commission made referenced to the Grain case and to the general rule in the Grain case and used that rule as the rational basis for arriving at their conclusion in this case, the ingot molds case, that the measure of inherent cost advantage would be based upon fully distributed cost of both carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.546" offset="3205517">The Commission refused the rail carrier's request in the Grain case to adjust upward the water carrier cost by adding public cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.568" offset="3249612">Just as in the ingot molds case, it refused to adjust downward the rail cost by ignoring constant cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.881" offset="3278869">Either action would have in effect eliminated or ignored the water carrier's inherent advantage of low cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.422" offset="3317112">The Commission having established the rule in the Grain case was perfectly within its right and it was its duty to follow that rule in this case because the rail carriers presented no reason for a departure from the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.475" offset="3377298">The rail carriers contended in this case that in determining the low cost mode, no comparison should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.200" offset="3408123">The Commission should simply determine if the railroad was enhancing its profit by charging a rate in excess of out-of-pocket cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.266" offset="3440410">The Commission rejected this approach citing the New Haven case and this Court's admonition that it must decide how to measure the cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.866" offset="3478862">The Commission reasoned that it could not compare by considering only the cost of the rail mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.741" offset="3510314">We find that the much discussed testimony of the four economists speaking for the railroads were summarized by the division as follows, that out-of-pocket costs rather than fully distributed costs should be the only basis for a pricing floor, that determination of the most economic form of transportation should be out-of-pocket cost and that there can be no meaningful comparison of full costs of rail versus water.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.279" offset="3632462">The full Commission adopted this summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.256" offset="3644374">The Commission did not ignore this testimony as suggested by the lower court but it did reject the proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.957" offset="3675199">Based upon the decision in the Grain case and in the line of quoted decision, it rejected the out-of-pocket cost as a measure of comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.456" offset="3713233">It is plain that while using out-of-pocket cost as a pricing floor may be proper when only the one mode of railroad is considered, the Commission rejected and with reason the proposal that only the rail rate and cost should be considered in the case under Section 15a(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="922.456" offset="3793168">It was never made clear by the economists just what was meant by the contention that out-of-pocket costs were best used in the determination of the most economic form of transportation or just how this would be a determinative if only one form of transportation was to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.526" offset="3873520">It was not necessary that the Commission set forth in detail all of its reasons for rejecting this testimony as determinative of the issues as in BNO versus U.S. -- 239 U.S. 349.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.515" offset="3929422">The court -- this Court held there is no requirement that the Commission specify the weight given to any item of evidence or fact or disclose mental operations by which its decisions are reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.743" offset="3990340">The lower court in questioning the Commission's use of out-of-pocket cost to determine the price floor in the Grain case mistakenly assumed that the Commission was considering inherent advantage of low cost in the same context as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.606" offset="4061811">It was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.070" offset="4067662">There was no comparison made in that case of the cost of unregulated carriers with those of the rails.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.272" offset="4096502">Section 15a(3) applies to different modes of transportation subject to the regulations under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.878" offset="4134849">Faced with the fact that traffic moved primarily in unregulated transportation, the Commission saw its task is different than any controversy such as in ingot molds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.048" offset="4179571">In this ingot molds decision, the Commission discussed the division report, adopted the findings of fact and conclusions consistent with its decision, fully discussed the contentions of the parties made in their petition for reconsideration, incorporated by reference its discussion in the Grain case including the complete discussion of fully distributed versus out-of-pocket cost as a measure of cost advantage, pointed out that the precise example given to the Congress as a reason for the language in Section 15a(3) is precisely the situation under discussion, discussed the importance of the traffic to the water carriers, concluded as did the division that barge-truck method on a fully distributed basis was the low cost mode, that the rail rate below the barge's fully distributed cost impends upon the ability of the barge-truck mode to completely assert its inherent cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.437" offset="4441109">In conclusion, may I say that contrary to the lower court's opinion, this is a normal situation involving intermodal competition between water and rail carriers, a situation contemplated in Section 15a(3), a situation in which the Commission is directed by the statute and by this Court in New Haven to determine the low cost mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.077" offset="4547688">In this normal situation, the Commission has rejected the rail's suggestion or proposal that it consider only rail out-of-pocket cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.364" offset="4584782">It would not decide the issue in that factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.397" offset="4597008">Instead, the Commission has adopted what it has described as its general rule to use fully distributed cost as a measure in determining the low cost agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.588" offset="4641729">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.883" offset="4666911">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.738" offset="4682376">The United States opposed the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case before the District Court and is opposing it before this Court because it believes that its decision in this case is not in conformity with the standards which Congress provided in Section 15a(3) for it to follow in cases involving rate regulation in intermodal competition situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.775" offset="4794493">In the New Haven case, this Court said that there can be no doubt that the purpose of this provision 15a(3) was to permit the railroads to respond to competition by asserting whatever inherent advantage of cost and service they possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.892" offset="4866905">Our basic position before this Court in this case is that the Commission here on this record has not given an adequate explanation as to why the inherent advantage here doesn't lie with the railroads rather than as it found with the barges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.681" offset="4942137">And we think, as I shall develop, that its decision turning down in this case the fully compensatory rail rates on ingot molds in fact prevents the very kind of vigorous hard competition between different modes of transportation that Congress intended to further in the 1958 amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.214" offset="5044224">Now, I want to state at the very outset and all candid that the position we're taking in this case here add variance from the position we took in our brief before in the New Haven case as was brought out yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.154" offset="5095946">Quite frankly, we have reexamined our position that we took in New Haven in the light of some intervening factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.701" offset="5122173">I'll just mention them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.166" offset="5128025">First, that Mr. Justice White pointed out in the New Haven case the Court did not accept our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.053" offset="5151535">Secondly, we have in this case the benefit of the economic testimony that was not before the Court in the New Haven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.118" offset="5183822">And finally, we have the fact that in 1966, the Council of Economic Advisors itself recommended the use of out-of-pocket cost as the basis for determining cost advantage in intermodal situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.889" offset="5530937">By out-of-pocket, we mean those costs that are directly related to the particular movement of traffic involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.820" offset="5562702">To put it the other way, these are costs that would not be incurred if the particular movement had not been made, and these are figured over what we call relatively long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.708" offset="5606170">It isn't just limited to the cost that would be incurred this week in moving one shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.331" offset="5624665">It's the amount that the particular type of traffic involved incurs as specific additional expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.701" offset="5658206">The long-term costs on the other hand are costs that are incurred whether or not the particular traffic is carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.368" offset="5692792">And thus, by definition, these long-term costs do not vary in respect to this particular traffic and also bear no particular relation to the traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.086" offset="6115767">Now, this is basically, it seems to us the way in which the railroads price at page 141 of the record in this case, based on the statistics developed by the Commission, the witness stated that in 1960, 65%, almost two-thirds of all of this country's rail traffic moved at rates that were below fully distributed costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.508" offset="6241364">That is almost two-thirds of the total traffic in this country moved at rates of the type involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.908" offset="6294967">As the Commission determines out-of-pocket costs, that includes some element of the fixed cost because they do allow a rate of return on a part of the carrier's plant investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.127" offset="6355884">They also however in calculating fixed costs take into account such things as passenger deficits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.336" offset="6628707">If they don't get fully distributed expenses in this situation, cost in this situation where they have competition, do not rate payers have to make that up where there is no competition?</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.958" offset="6727241">They have to make it up in the sense that obviously, the total operation has to be borne by all of the customers of the railroad's total expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.399" offset="6764962">But the fact is -- the fact is that in this very case, permitting the railroad to carry this traffic at a rate that yields it more than its out-of-pocket cost actually contributes something to the total amount that the railroad has to earn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.192" offset="6840090">In other words, the other customers of this railroad -- and let's assume a man who is shipping furniture and does not have this rate, this man is actually better off in the long run if the railroads carry this traffic at this rate than they don't because before this rate was put into effect, the railroads were carrying virtually none of this traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.754" offset="6926399">That meant there was nothing on this traffic that was producing anything toward the total of the fixed cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.852" offset="6950745">Under this rate which caused the out-of-pocket cost to roughly $4.70 when the rate is $5.11, that means that for every ton of ingot molds that moves, $0.41 is contributed toward meeting the railroad's total overhead cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.557" offset="7025560">Now, in our whole economic system, pricing under our system involves facing up to the competitive situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.387" offset="7060877">Of course, where the railroads are not faced with this competition, they're going to price at what the traffic will bear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2157.811" offset="8734595">It said that this particular broad category, iron and steel products is the third largest category of traffic that barges handle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.937" offset="8799169">Now, I take it the implication in this is that if this rate cut is permitted, therefore it will follow that the railroads could make comparable rate cuts on all similar traffic and thus take away from the barge lines a total of 11% of their traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.972" offset="9583261">We had four distinguished economists in this case who dealt with the whole question the economics of so-called incremental cost price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.104" offset="9627773">The basis -- the whole thing is the railroads have already sunk into the economy a great deal of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.383" offset="9660897">They have these very heavy fixed costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.467" offset="9673226">And the economists pointed out that if you attempt to determine the inherent cost advantage on the basis of these heavy fixed costs, you're necessarily introducing an arbitrary element into this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.291" offset="9736547">These costs are apportioned among the different commodities on a basis that has no direct relationship, no relationship at all to the particular cost incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.198" offset="9784195">And that as long as it -- as I get back from carrying the particular commodity more than it costs me out-of-pocket more than my expenses of carrying the commodity, I am better off than if I didn't carry the commodity at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.414" offset="10309047">Now, the Commission, when it dealt with this economic evidence, gave several reasons why it said it was not persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.089" offset="10355754">The first reason it gave was -- basically, it said well, we have always in the past in dealing with this problem of intermodal competition treated fully distributed rather than out-of-pocket cost as the basis for determining inherent advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.548" offset="10441540">They cited a group of cases for this proposition and with one exception none of the cases really discussed the economics of the problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.120" offset="10479888">The one case that did discuss it was the Grain case that Mr. Ames has relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.840" offset="10502771">Now, I think the significance of the Grain case is while the Commission said in that case that when dealing with competition between regulated modes of competition it will look to fully distributed cost, the holding in the case -- the holding in the case was that because the competing water traffic was unregulated, they would determine inherent advantage on the basis of out-of-pocket costs and they upheld a reduced railroad rate because of the fact that the railroad's rates were above out-of-pocket costs even though they were below the barge lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.476" offset="10661282">And I think it's significant to see what the Commission said in explaining in that case why where you had an unregulated mode it was appropriate to use out-of-pocket costs as the basis for determining inherent advantage because it seems to us the very reasoning the Commission gave in that case for reaching that result there applies equally to the situation present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.564" offset="10777579">What the Commission said is as follows and this is on 321 ICC at pages 601 to 602.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.926" offset="10811120">The Commission said the optimum utilization of this excess capacity, and it was referring to the fact that the railroads used the word had sunk a great deal of capital into excess capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.238" offset="10864306">The optimum utilization of this excess capacity is clearly consistent with the objectives of the National Transportation Policy provided that the existence of such excess capacity is not used as a destructive competitive weapon, and the fact that railroad rate was going to be below the barge rate and thus obviously take some of the business away was not viewed by the Commission as a destructive competitive weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.133" offset="10967855">In the instant proceeding, it is clearly in the public interest and in furtherance of the National Transportation Policy to permit the respondents to utilize their excess plant capacity to increase their net revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.764" offset="11030444">Knowing the Commission here has recognized the fact that it benefits the railroads, it benefits the shippers, it leads to the more efficient utilization of the nation's transportation resources to permit the railroad to price at a level which produces something over and above its cost incurred in carrying the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.896" offset="11130964">Now, the Commission gave some other explanations as to why it felt that in this case, fully distributed costs were the appropriate method of determining inherent cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.115" offset="11179865">It said the following at page 67 to 68 of the record, merely because a carrier is able without incurring an out-of-pocket loss to handle certain traffic at rates below fully distributed costs and perhaps by diverting sufficient tonnage from its regulated competitors to maximize thereby the contribution that such traffic would make to its overhead does not necessarily mean that the carrier is the more efficient of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.677" offset="11298043">Well, it seems to us that if in fact one carrier can handle the traffic at a lower rate than another that is it can sell its goods cheaper and still make a profit that by definition is the most efficient operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.663" offset="11358020">What efficiency means in the industrial sense is the ability to produce goods cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.669" offset="11386023">Then the Commission made the following statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.874" offset="11398875">It said that by reducing its rate -- this is at page 71 of the appendix -- by reducing its rate below the level of the barge-truck full costs, the respondent railroads have unlawfully impinged upon the ability of the barge-truck mode competitively to assert its inherent cost advantage -- competitively to assert its inherent cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.179" offset="11488110">But long before, three years before the railroads had filed this rate reducing the level to the barge lines, the barge lines themselves had put into effect the rate of $5.11 which is below their fully distributed costs of $5.19.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.624" offset="11573896">Now, there are two other respects I'd like to talk about in the Commission's report, and while we think the Commission in this case has not adequately focused on these issues, why we think the Commission has not done the kind of job it should do if its expertise is to be given great weight by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.714" offset="11662190">The Commission focused exclusively on the cost aspect of inherent advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.659" offset="11682043">The claim that the barges, whether they have the inherent cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.811" offset="11702627">But inherent advantage is, as this Court has recognized in New Haven, has another element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.325" offset="11720704">It includes service as well as cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.431" offset="11733138">And if in fact at the same rate the railroads are going to get all of this traffic, this would seem to indicate very clearly that at least as far as the service advantage is concerned, that lies with the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.537" offset="11789563">That it seems to us is an inherent advantage of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.802" offset="11802624">And the Commission nowhere in its report attempted to deal with this face of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.993" offset="11827388">Now, in addition with dealing with the National Transportation Policy, the Commission restricted itself solely to the provision that the Act is to be administered to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of each mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.368" offset="11896874">The statute, however, directs the Commission to give due consideration to the objectives -- plural, objectives -- of the National Transportation Policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.468" offset="11961240">They more broadly included a wide range of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.724" offset="11982242">Particularly, the Commission is enjoined to promote safe, adequate, economical and efficient services and force to sound economic conditions and transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.608" offset="12033755">These are factors which we think in the face of this economic testimony, the Commission was required to give some consideration to explain in the light of what the realities are of pricing of railroad services, to explain why permitting this type of pricing was not in the public interest in furthering these other objectives of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.540" offset="12133543">Now, Mr. Helmetag who represents the railroads will discuss in greater detail of a legislative history of this statute, but we think basically what is shown here is the very kind of hard competition that commerce intended in Section 15a(3) for the railroads to be allowed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.424" offset="12225076">We think basically with 15a(3) contemplated was that as long as the railroads were able to carry a product at a figure above their full -- their out-of-pocket costs and as long as viewed in the light of those out-of-pocket costs a prima facie at least, the railroads would have the inherent advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.743" offset="12322356">If that is the situation, what commerce intended was to leave it to the marketplace, to leave it to the customers to decide which of the competing modes of carriage they wish to select, not to allow the Commission in fact to step in and say no because of the fact that the barges are going to lose this little bit of traffic and because we're concerned that if they lose this, this will be the opening wedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.984" offset="12423293">Therefore, it must be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.481" offset="12433324">And I would like to close, if I may, with two sentences from this Court's opinion in the New Haven decision where this Court said, If there is one fact that stands out in bold relief in the legislative history of Section 15a(3), it is that Congress did not regard the setting of a rate at a particular level as constituting an unfair or destructive competitive practice simply because the rate would divert some or all of the traffic from a competing mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.555" offset="12565608">If a carrier is prohibited from establishing a reduced rate that is not detrimental to its own revenue requirements merely because the rate will divert traffic from others, then the carrier is thwarted from asserting its own inherent advantages of cost and service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.817" offset="12642617">And we think that is precisely this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.195" offset="12872182">Yes, it is the proper rate making because I think the idea that -- but omitting this kind of rate making on this particular commodity, you're loading the course on to the other, to the other shippers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3214.517" offset="12961416">That is if I may suggest come back again on this particular shipment by providing the carrier with additional revenue, it would not have received had it not been carrying the ingot molds traffic and it's clear that unless they came down to the barge rate, they couldn't get it by enabling the carrier to get this additional revenue, this additional revenue which would not otherwise has gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.528" offset="13069458">The other shippers are actually better off in the long run because they have to bear less of this burden for each ton of ingot molds that moves, the man who is shipping try -- furniture or the man who is shipping building blocks, the man who is shipping anything else has in the totality, these other shippers have to pay $0.41 less to the overheard cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.465" offset="13169246">And the very nature of competition is such I think that when you are faced with a competitive situation, what you will do is to set your price at a level that will maximize the profits from that traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.056" offset="13223581">If you have a competitor, if you're competing with another form of transportation, you have to make your rate competitive if you hope to get that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3716.992" offset="14971382">I would say at the outset that our position here is the same as the position that -- which Mr. Friedman has advanced for the United States Government and it's the same position that the antitrust division of the Department of Justice took in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.843" offset="15070751">I think it might be well to emphasize at the outset one of the points that Mr. Friedman touched upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="4057.581" offset="16333720">I would remind perhaps Mr. Justice Fortas that in response to the questions he has been asking that Section 15a(3) does not order the Commission merely to judge the lawfulness of these reduce rates by the National Transportation Policy but contains other specific standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.847" offset="16434761">For example, if you would turn to page 34 of the appendix, the controlling statutory standards in Section 15a(3) which is the standard that apply to this type of reduced intermodal competitive rate making is the first one, the Commission in determining whether a rate is valid than a reasonable minimum rate shall consider the facts and circumstances attending the movement of traffic by the carrier or carriers to which the rate is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.569" offset="16589615">Now, that standard says that the Commission in judging the lawfulness of this rate should do so in respect to the characteristics of rail movement and the cost of the rail movement not the cost of the competing barge lines and then it goes on to say, rates of a carrier shall not be held up to a particular level to protect the traffic of any other mode of transportation giving due consideration to the objectives in multiple not the single objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="4455.731" offset="17926248">That's the normal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.577" offset="17933667">It happen everyday before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.305" offset="17948609">I'm running a little short of time but I would like to just say something about the legislative history of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.219" offset="17984240">Particularly with respect to the requirement that the Commission recognized and preserves inherent advantages, this requirement came into law, and in 1935, a part of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 and it came in at the insistence of the motor carrier industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.199" offset="18080162">Now, the reason they insisted upon this, they were afraid that the Commission would require the motor carrier to raise their rates in order to protect the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.869" offset="18130840">The legislative history makes it clear that what the motor carriers insisted upon was the right to have their rate reflects their own cost characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.767" offset="18182457">Now, in 1940 when the Congress had before the Transportation Act of 1940 which brought on the regulation the water carrier industry, the water carrier made the same demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.690" offset="18238151">They insisted that if they were going to be brought on the regulation that the Commission in judging the lawfulness of their rate do it with respect to their own cost considerations and not the cost considerations of the railroad and in 1958 when the Section 15a(3) was before the Congress, Senator Smathers, Senator Wheeler to come and testify into what was the intent and purpose of the National Transportation Policy with respect to the preservation of inherent advantages and Senator Wheeler said that the purpose was to just as I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.236" offset="18424351">To make certain that the Commission in judging the lawfulness of rates of any mode would do so with respect to that mode's cost -- own cost characteristics and not the characteristics of another mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.120" offset="18475865">And during our colloquy with Senator Schoeppel who -- Senator Wheeler made the statement in this part, Senator Schoeppel said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.488" offset="18525288">?Of course all of that was tied to one cord of factor namely that those rates when they were established would be compensatory was it not, talking about the preservation of inherent advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.471" offset="18577220">And Mr. Wheeler who had managed the 1940 Act in the Motor Carrier Act said, to be part in this matter exactly, as long as they were compensatory then they could reduce the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.710" offset="18638242">The water carrier could reduce their rate as long as they were compensatory to take business of way or the motor carriers could reduce their rates to a compensatory level to take business away from the railroad and the railroad could reduce their rate to meet competition so long as they are compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.671" offset="18718072">Now, it was in view of that legislative history that the lower court found that normally, the Commission should approve rate when it binds their compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.833" offset="18762689">And that in this case since they have found they were compensatory and beneficial to the railroad own revenue requirement, they should have approved them but if they weren't going to approve them, they had a very heavy obligation to show why they were taking it diametrically opposite approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.132" offset="18843878">That is approach inconsistent with the legislative history of Section 15a(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.702" offset="18878151">I would -- if I had the time, I would point out that the lower court made a great reference to the new automobiles case and said that that case in which the Commission had dealt with the 1940 Act provided the proper philosophy to be applied in this situation but the Commission had not followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.381" offset="18956936">They didn't follow it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.503" offset="18965400">And therefore, the lower court quite properly concluded that what the Commission had done here was inconsistent with the legislative history and the intent of Congress that carriers and this intermodal situation should be normally free to reduce their rates provided their compensatory and provided they're not detrimental to the carrier's own requirements and in doing that, the lower court was echoing precisely what this Court had said in New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.937" offset="19103117">And this Court in New Haven as the Court will remember said that carriers should not be prohibited from reducing a rate which is compensatory and which is not detrimental to its own requirements merely because such a rate would have divert traffic from the competitive mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.382" offset="19176887">And that Court went on to say that this applied even though it would take all of the traffic from another mode and even though it would destroy the other mode so that the impact of this rate on the barge line would have no concern to the Commission under both the New Haven doctrine and under the legislative history of the applicable section and I see it that I'll close on that note.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.098" offset="19275734">I would invite attention -- the Court's attention to the fact that we have detailed in our brief the legislative history of the applicable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.815" offset="19318680">I would mention to Mr. Justice White that the report of the accounts of economic advisors is quoted in part to page 36 of our brief in Footnote 78.</text>

            <text syncTime="4835.501" offset="19445426">In the guise of asking more findings from the Commission, the department and the appellees generally would impose a rule of law on the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.109" offset="19499760">In their view, the Commission must permit the railroads to decrease their rates within this margin between full cost and out-of-pocket cost in the discretion of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.951" offset="19543228">The counsel for the railroads has stated to this Court, the Commission had no concern with the effect on the barge lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.639" offset="19585964">Now, I wish to emphasize very strongly that affirming the lower court's decision means that this Court affirms that rule of law and our reason for appeal was to overturn that rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.211" offset="19660257">Now, the appellees urge that this particular rate that was before the Commission would not seriously affect the barge lines while the Commission's judgment differed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.483" offset="19717308">Its judgment differed with respect both to the effectiveness rate on the barge lines and with respect to the effect of this practice, this measure of inherent advantage that the railroads espoused the effect of this practice on the barge lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.662" offset="19794004">Further, the Commission's findings in this case are indeed sufficient to support the Commission's full cost standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.931" offset="19839143">Now, I believe the counsel for the department inadvertently state to this Court that the Commission had not even considered service advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.277" offset="19872475">If the Court please, at pages 40 and 43 of the record, there are findings there concerning the service advantages and findings to the effect that service advantages are not determinative of the issue in this case.</text>
