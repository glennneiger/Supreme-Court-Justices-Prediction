            <label>Mr. Arnold I. Shure</label>
            <text syncTime="40.160" offset="264025">Mr. Chief Justice, Justices may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.036" offset="291506">This case is here in certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.979" offset="315329">It involves an interpretation of the definition of security in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.597" offset="369768">In connection with this argument that as I state the facts of the case that the Court bare in mind the decisions, many of which are of recent years of this Court dealing on what are securities and what the purpose of the 1933 Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is although the direct decision of this Court on the 1934 Act was on the recent case of Surowitz versus Hilton Hotels Corporation and this Court set out a strong statement of the fact that the primary aim and purpose of the 1934 Act as well as the 1933 Act is the protection of the general public and investors including the uninformed, the gullible, the ignorant and the little investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.020" offset="579480">Judge Cummings dissented on the opinion -- majority opinion of the Court in our matter and his opinion sets forth the aims and purposes of the 1934 Act and that they are served by the application of that Act to the typical savings and loan accounts holder who was a small investor who was just as unwary and in need of protection of the typical and sophisticated holder of corporate stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.985" offset="687313">Now the other cases pertaining to the 1933 Act that I think are particularly important here are the Securities and Exchange Commission versus W.J. Howey, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.491" offset="733288">C.M. Joiner, S.E.C. versus Joiner 1943, the variable annuities case which involved the main opinion or the concurring opinion and dissenting opinion, 1959, the United Benefit Insurance Company, lawyers term of court -- and the Capital Gains Research case which involves another section of the Act but still dealt with the overall purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.412" offset="860975">This action was brought pursuant to Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10(b)(5) promulgated there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.487" offset="909354">The respondents here and the defendants below are the City Savings Association which is an insolvent Savings to Loan Association which has closed its doors and is now in the process of liquidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.478" offset="969331">Its officers and directors, the liquidators or purported liquidators and certain officials of the State of Illinois who had seized custody of the association at the time the complaint herein was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.552" offset="1017605">The petitioners are about 150 investors in the capital shares of City Savings Association pursuing on their own behalf and as a class action on behalf of over 5,000 investors who purchased their shares after July 24, 1959 and prior to the closing on June 26, 1964 just short of five years.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="255.728" offset="1126275">What is the relevance of that date?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arnold_i_shure" startTime="258.430" stopTime="438.291">
            <label>Mr. Arnold I. Shure</label>
            <text syncTime="258.430" offset="1137142">The only relevance of the date is that all of the investors who were there prior to July 24, 1959 were investors prior to 1957 because in 1957, the association had been closed by the State of Illinois and then reopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.410" offset="1213001">The accounts were frozen and the people couldn’t withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.760" offset="1226376">So these people were in the plate that they’re still in except for the fact that they’ve been able to realize some recovery of their interest out of the new moneys which we claim were received from our clients in the class we represent, through misrepresentation and fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.921" offset="1299101">Now the relevance becomes very important because the defense is based on the theory that this creates a hardship on these earlier investors and I can only suggest this as the natural consequences of that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.315" offset="1368586">Here are people who were there prior to 1957 that were frozen and it’s still there in 1959 when the management of the association started in on a program of defrauding new people by selling new securities to outsiders without telling them of the material facts which should have been disclosed to them under the terms of the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.482" offset="1469315">Now what material terms were not disclosed?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.441" offset="1481122">For one thing, this association which was soliciting investors through the United States mail sent throughout the country failed to disclose to these new people that in representing how safe this association was as they did that they failed to disclose that the association had applied for federal insurance from the homeowners -- from the Federal Home Loan Bank which is in charge of the FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.795" offset="1598568">And after examination, they rejected the association and the reasons stated for the rejection were the unsafe management and unsafe financial policies of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.949" offset="1647156">Well to us, it is quite material that when people are informed that this is a safe association, we believe that at the same time whether they wanted to tell these new investors or not that in representing that it was safe, they have to tell them that that was -- had been held we believe it’s safe but the government thinks it’s not and they won’t give us any insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.444" offset="1729181">And particularly when they were soliciting people had their money and insured associations to withdraw and come to this association that was very material to tell them that they have been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.333" offset="1768678">We do not charge that there was a fraud by -- that they told anybody they were insured nor do we charge that the mere non-statement of the fact that they were uninsured would in itself possibly have created a fraud or possibly it might have under the circumstances but when they say how safe they are then I think that they became incumbent upon them to tell the whole story.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.186" offset="2176084">The state security laws were well known just the same as they were in connection with the 1933 Act. This is mentioned in the Variable Annuities case that there are state acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.870" offset="2782856">It is our opinion that these cases are relevant because the first thing we have to do in defining a term is to find out what the term means and we have to find out what stock is and stock is the investor’s interest of the -- the investor who takes the risk of the success of the enterprise as in this savings of loan association and that’s why they are called shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.015" offset="2871463">The definition in the Act provides that the term security means any stock among other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.939" offset="4859173">I was addressing myself to that but if the Board wishes, I’ll pass this over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.149" offset="4883937">As far as -- we then are getting to the definition of security as set forth here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.423" offset="4909014">We have asserted that we do hold stock in a corporation which is clearly within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.955" offset="4931166">We claim that we have certificate of interest or participation in a profit sharing agreement, investment contract and a transferable share which brings us down to the question of whether or not this is commonly known as a security which I called the secondary of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.923" offset="5003055">They -- in examining the authorities and the arguments cited by the respondents, we find that time after time in attempting to prove that this is not stock or this is not a transferable share whatever it may -- one is attempting to prove in particular cases, we find a situation developing where we come head on into a matter of commonly known us, for instance Professor Kerry who was then chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission testified in 1963 with respect to the 1964 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.562" offset="5137638">He was asked why savings and loan shares were exempted from the additional registration probations which were being imposed by the 19 -- by the proposed amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.301" offset="5176613">His answer was because these are commonly known as shares and it was therefore necessary to provide an exemption for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.813" offset="5214647">The testimony and the report in 1932 which was two years before passage of this Act in connection with amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, the house judiciary committee made a statement that they were not taking on the liquidation of savings and loan association through bankruptcy and this would be left to state regulation which could better liquidate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.954" offset="5323212">In the house report statement, these interests are referred to as securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.678" offset="5346095">They are referred to as securities over and over again in federal sources, in state sources, there are at least five Acts in Illinois that referred to in these securities and the respondents assert that since the Illinois legislature went to pass those acts was not referring for this particular federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.156" offset="5428015">Therefore, those citations to the Illinois acts and to their reference to these as securities were an opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.703" offset="5462183">However, if we are looking to see what is commonly known as the security, we look into the Illinois legislature, we look into the legislative action of the states throughout the country and we find wherever we go and in the testimony of the representatives of the savings and loan industry in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.241" offset="5528325">It connects with the passage of the 1933 Act which contains the statute of the same definition that they said they welcome these antifraud provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.432" offset="5561135">They did not want to be registered but they welcome the antifraud provisions application for this type of interest. The respondents have raised the point that in connection with the 1933 Act, there was a considerable testimony in opposition to the registration of these securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.946" offset="5635114">They also state that there was opposition to their inclusion generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.743" offset="5650369">They say that nothing appears in the legislative history of the 1934 Act to indicate whether anything in connection with these savings and loan shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.339" offset="5696763">The fact remains that the 1933 hearings did encompass all of the objections that anybody wanted to make and there were hearings and representations by those who favored registration and those who oppose registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.611" offset="5749844">What was the net result?</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.237" offset="5756322">In 1933, they exempted from the registration provision and specifically not -- did not exempt them from the antifraud provisions in ‘33 Act only those savings and loan associations which made loans to their members and which did not charge more than 3% for the privilege of withdrawal so that the net result of all the controversy about what happened in the congressional hearings on the 1933 Act adds up to nothing because they didn’t get the exemptions yet respondents would argue that because these things were discussed, therefore congress must have had in mind in 1934 they want to exclude them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.671" offset="5922043">But if we look at the 1934 Act, we find that there are some very significant references when they wanted to exclude any reference or any supervision over insurance company securities, the congress put it in very plainly but when they wanted to -- but when it got down to its savings and loan associations, the only reference to exclusion of any savings and loan associations as the exemption paragraph that I've just mentioned which does not exclude savings and loan associations generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.275" offset="6068433">If we look at the cases cited against the background of that definition and we look at all of the pertinent laws which have been passed not only in Illinois but are represented by the United States Savings and Loan League and its literature which we have cited as covering states throughout the country where they have referred to these securities -- where they advocate these as investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.731" offset="6170311">We come to the inescapable conclusion that this is the type of investment that the Congress was talking about and it doesn’t make any difference whether it was -- it comes from little people who put in very small sums of money and accumulate them over lifetime or when it comes -- where the money is invested by people who have a lot of money and invested in the shares of large companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.257" offset="6256410">The concept of regulation that is objected to by the respondents here is a different kind of regulation and if this -- if the Court holds here as has generally been understood to be the law throughout the years that these are securities and are protected by the antifraud provisions, this does not mean that any Savings and Loan Association has to do one thing as far as registering that you don’t have to register, they need to do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.671" offset="6358079">All they need to do is not make misrepresentations to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.959" offset="6375215">They cannot sell these securities and hold back vital information such as the fact that they are in serious financial trouble with their other investors and that there is a no money that is being taken in, through one door is going out the other door or through another window to make partial payments under your payout plans of the old investors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.140" offset="7475911">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.906" offset="7499003">In these associations as Mr. Shure has said, the holders of shares have the equity position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.129" offset="7539858">They are corporations consequently the nearest analogy to the position of these people is that of shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.205" offset="7592208">As Judge Cummings pointed out in the Illinois statutes expressly provide that they are not creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.675" offset="7622092">They have a certain unusual characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.333" offset="7632750">They are so long as the association is operating normally and profitably redeemable and therefore they are not traded in the markets because the investor who wants to sell instead just redeems and the amounts of which he redeems is fixed so there would really be no point in trading them in the market so long as the association was operating profitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.439" offset="7733164">When the association gets in trouble, trading may develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.193" offset="7752182">They are nonnegotiable for the same reason that they don’t trade because the redeemability features no need to have them traded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.774" offset="7794500">Now Mr. Shure referred to four cases in this Court which considered the definition of security under the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.295" offset="7836505">I think that those cases taking in conjunction not only show that this is a security but refute each of the contentions that the respondents make that they shouldn’t be deemed to be shares because they’re redeemable for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.976" offset="7907244">Well, the variable annuity and flexible fund were both redeemable at the option of the holder during the pay in period that they are not traded in the markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.261" offset="7952384">Well, the orange groves interests and oil leases involved in Howey and Joiner were not traded on any exchange or in any organized market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.181" offset="8008077">Further, the cannons of construction used by this Court in those opinions and in other cases such as the Capital Gains case, the effect that these statutes are to be broadly construed that the fact that an instrument falls that this broader features of this definition are not to be used to cut down the specific features and conversely the specific features do not limit the broader features.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.040" offset="8139525">All of these, I think demonstrate that this is a security at least for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 with sufficient clarity that I don’t think that is really contested anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.303" offset="8212564">The Legislative History of the ‘33 Act shows that Congress expressly considered the status of savings and loan shares and determined that they would be exempted from registration but included under the fraud provisions and the savings and loan industry acquiesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.893" offset="8290931">In fact they seemed to think this was a good idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.177" offset="8304097">They didn’t want to be registered because of the expense but they did want federal protections against fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.912" offset="9259029">There seems to be a suggestion, the Securities Exchange Act is somehow different and narrower than the Securities Act and the same broad construction should not be applied to that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.778" offset="9318484">That seems to be suggested also in the majority opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.333" offset="9336665">It seems to me that this suggestion has no basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.038" offset="9355473">These two acts were passed by the same Congress on the same term -- no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.529" offset="9377520">Same Congress and basically the basis of the same investigation and in response to the same events, the stock market depression and the words of the definition were impertinent part I think substantially identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.077" offset="9443662">The only difference of which anything has been made is the concept of evidence of indebtedness used in the ‘33 Act and not the Exchange Act to which I ought to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.598" offset="9485772">It seems to me inconceivable under these circumstances that Congress -- if the congress had intended the same words, stock transferable share, investment contract, certificate of interest or participation in a profit sharing agreement and so forth were to mean something different in the Exchange Act that they meant in the Securities Act that there would have been some hint of this somewhere in the statue or on the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.126" offset="9619832">There is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.833" offset="9626728">There is no suggestion that these words somehow mean something different in the act that followed a year later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.112" offset="9659852">Incidentally, the Ninth Circuit in the Los Angeles trustee case apparently felt that once it had shown that the real estate interests they are involved which where participations and mortgages were securities, investment contracts for purposes of the Securities Act, it necessarily followed that they were securities for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act and granted the decree accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.770" offset="9766431">The structure of the two acts is based -- as here pertinent is basically the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.096" offset="9787747">You will have a broad definition of security including practically all media of investment evidenced by an intangible except the direct ownership of property and even that sometimes is in Howey followed by appropriate exemptions from the right registration or regulatory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.754" offset="9890356">The savings and loan shares vary of a certain type were exempted from the registration but not the fraud provisions in the Securities Act and again in the Exchange Act when the coverage of the Exchange Act was broaden to include securities not traded on exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.488" offset="9981367">The failure to include evidence of indebtedness in the definition in the Exchange Act is I think irrelevant for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.889" offset="10014908">First because as Judge Cummings had shown, this is not an evidence of indebtedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.756" offset="10034448">There is no debtor-creditor relationship and in any event, it falls within the other terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.183" offset="10068093">I think probably, the significance although the Congress didn’t say of taking out and not putting evidence of indebtedness in is probable that -- it is probable that that term was so broad as to include things that are not investment media at all lik doctor Bill which says you are owed money or an I owe you or a cashier’s check or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.470" offset="10181256">In the -- none of the cases which I have referred to, the four cases referred and under the Securities Act which we think govern here involved the term investment contract and none of them -- I mean evidence of indebtedness and non-relied on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.606" offset="10257847">Finally, there is no policy reason to exclude this type of share from the protection of the fraud provisions of the Exchange Act that is not equally applicable to the fraud provisions of the Securities Act which as we have seen the congress expressly did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.167" offset="10351992">To read these interest out of the fraud provisions of the Exchange Act would have certain anomalous consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.201" offset="10396191">It would mean that fraud in the sale of such interest would be prohibited by federal law but not fraud in the purchase because the ‘33 Act only reaches fraud in the sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.953" offset="10451153">The Congress brought in the ‘34 Act to include fraud in the sale or in any transaction in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.602" offset="10505801">The commission’s authority to register and regulate broker dealers who deal in these issues would be eliminated and there seems -- it has existed from the beginning for it has been the commission’s consistent administrative construction ever since 1934 that these interests are securities for purposes of Securities Exchange Act as well as for purposes of a Securities Act, Very few courts have had to consider this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.643" offset="10649893">No one has ever seemed to think it required extensive litigation before this case and those instances which are cited in our brief where the Court did have occasion to consider this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.765" offset="10698480">They have all proceeded upon the assumption at least that these are securities for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.491" offset="10737351">Here, we are dealing both for purposes of the Securities Act and for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act with the fraud provisions and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.822" offset="10770683">No greater federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.526" offset="10781445">Congress has never thought that the existence of state regulation justifies exemption from the fraud provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.132" offset="10811852">Indeed the fraud provisions of the Securities Act applied by necessary implication to state securities themselves, state bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.315" offset="10852603">The Congress insofar as fraud is concerned, intended to broaden and improve and provide greater protections in this Exchange Act and to determine that it would have provided in the Securities Act and the contention that somehow the Exchange Act is to be interpreted more narrowly insofar --</text>

            <text syncTime="4650.320" offset="18704697">The only thing that you see constantly throughout this -- the debates, the hearings preliminary to the passing of the 1934 Act is that there is a desire to protect the institutions descending alone institution, the bank savings -- the mutual bank savings, the banks, insurance companies, because this institutions invested in securities and bonds that were fluctuating in value due to the problems that were raised at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.594" offset="18833742">There was a desire to make sure and protect the integrity of the investments of these institutions, not the interest that are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="4703.075" offset="18915662">They want -- there was no desire to protect the particular savings interest because there is no trading in this and we could see this in the Section 2 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.657" offset="18954010">Section 2 specifically sets forth the purpose and the intention of Congress and we see in that Act that the purpose was to regulate trading and the traders of investments.</text>

            <text syncTime="5378.946" offset="21619127">But as I said that there is a possibility and we have said that in our brief that there maybe a claim under the ‘33 Act if assuming there is the elements of their cause of action provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.354" offset="21668760">We just like to state that the industry did not come to Congress in 1934 to seek any exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.501" offset="21697390">Because there was no intent, no consideration to really protect -- really cover this type of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.247" offset="21728319">The only indication that you have from any sort of association such as a mutual savings bank or savings and loan association or an insurance company seeking any sort of relief if there were any coverage was by the mutual savings banks and they only ask not for exemption of their interest but for an exemption of municipal bonds because they invested it in municipal bonds which were traded and they felt that they needed to have some exemption because this is one of the investments they make but not for the interest that they were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.550" offset="21861543">Therefore, there is entirely no intent to include these type of insurance in the ‘34 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.499" offset="21893413">This is born out by the testimony, by the hearings, by the reports, by the debates that a petition as an S.E.C. has demonstrated nothing to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.106" offset="21935835">In fact, the S.E.C brief in reply to our brief is conspicuous by its remedy and that they virtually concede the Congressional history, the legislative history in this particular act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.200" offset="21984214">They do not say anything to the contrary and it is their burden to show that there was an intent to include as particular transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.287" offset="22020472">And then -- and we have in 1963 the situation where the -- the hearings had conducted and Chairman Cary of the S.E.C. testified and Mr. Milton Cone who was part of a special study testified in regard to savings and loan associations and savings and loan accounts and they said that these account should be exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.490" offset="22113364">They also said that the savings and loan account should be on parity with bank accounts because this was the same type of transactions that they were -- same type of transactions. They also said that there’s normally no trading in these type of interest, nothing at all and it’s very unlikely that they thought that this type of interest was within the purview of the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.868" offset="22222869">Then we have an understanding that these type of associations, building and loan associations as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out are mutual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.556" offset="22253589">They are mutual associations and this is born out by the theory and principle behind it that was necessary for such associations to prevail during the 30’s, this mutuality where you don’t have one group of depositors on the neck of another group of depositors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.414" offset="22333001">They all work together and shared together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.982" offset="22343346">This was the concept that Mr. Prather in his article that we cite in 15 business law points out that it may cause the building and loan associations to have a very good record during the 30s because of mutuality.</text>

            <text syncTime="5889.395" offset="23660962">In fact, we must look to the instant action to see that it was the state that triggered this entire situation when the state director of financial institutions after a surprise examination on this institution, on this association, took and sees the assets of this particular association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.701" offset="23738180">It was this surprise order that focused, that brought this entire situation to life that the petitioners would have any knowledge whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.390" offset="23776946">If we look then to the true intent of Congress and balancing the equities as trying to see that all depositors are treated fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.267" offset="23816443">That is the state which a role is adjusted to this particular situation and this Court has constantly said that in this situation -- where the state role was adjusted to a situation such as particularly in liquidation preceding, it is then we should leave the state remain to regulate the particular interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.454" offset="23901184">Historically and traditionally then in conclusion, it has been proven that in this area, the state regulates and not any specific private remedy that a particular individual may have because it hasn’t been used, there hasn’t been any need for this because the state has done this and because of that concept of mutuality in the savings and loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.366" offset="23984880">In fact, the S.E.C. has done very little in this area even though it may have had the power to regulate the -- in certain areas with regard to the antifraud provisions of the Security Act that has done virtually nothing except possibly in the Maryland’s case where you find that there are very little regulation and now as I understand that there is very strong state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.558" offset="24077563">Therefore, whenever you have strong state regulations coupled with federal regulation by the Home Loan Bank Board, by the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6250.946" offset="25107205">First of all, I see no policy, federal or state which should borrow a man who has been defrauded of his money assuming he has been getting it back again.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.320" offset="25144613">There is no reason why a shareholder of a corporation which has received moneys through federal officers should have some equity suddenly come up out of nowhere so that he is entitled to participate in his wrongfully secured funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.668" offset="25198007">That’s my first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.675" offset="25202082">The second thing is that one of the reasons our federal remedy is a better one taking it in this particular cases that we have the string of cases going back for a hundred years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.189" offset="25244087">We have Case versus Los Angeles, Lumber Company, the Northern Pacific against Boyd that we remember from the reorganization days and those cases held that there is a rule of absolute priorities in equity that you just don’t sit down and do Curbstone equity and let people just keep money or reshuffle the rights and put shareholder ahead of creditors or whatever may be sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.123" offset="25335829">Now with regard to the type of regulation that we have in Illinois that the Attorney General’s office has been speaking of, he says that they can’t buy -- they can’t invest any other money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.420" offset="25381073">Justice Stewart asked whether they are limited to investments and homes I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="6405.331" offset="25724740">Now as far as the attitude of the general counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the answer is that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board does approve of this idea that these are violations of the ‘34 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6417.476" offset="25773328">And the proof of that is that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board sent out a letter to every savings and loan insured association this country suggesting to them that they better check their advertising about a year ago because they were advertising that they were paying five and three quarter percent on their accounts and they really weren’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.453" offset="25853158">The five and three quarter percent was what the result was as the result of the accumulative interest in the last quarter so that as to all periods prior to that, they were in violation.</text>
