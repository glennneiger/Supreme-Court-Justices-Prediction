            <text syncTime="9.150" offset="142043">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.622" offset="151865">Mr. Justice Fortas raised the issue yesterday which I want to clarify, reexamine the record or the question exactly when the arrest for vagrancy took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.834" offset="188750">It appears without any dispute in the record, that the arresting officer made the arrest of vagrancy on the street and specifically, explicitly told the petitioner on the street that he was arresting him for vagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.153" offset="238070">That appears on the record at the BE 168-169 and again at BE 148.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.790" offset="272551">I argued yesterday that the arrest was unlawful, if that so caused the search itself consequently unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.483" offset="311317">Even if the arrest is found by this Court to be lawful, though we don’t concede that it was, we still contend that the search was nonetheless unlawful for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.156" offset="354053">First, it doesn’t satisfy the requirements for a search incidental to an arrest and that’s so whether or not the arrest is found to be either for vagrancy or for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.897" offset="396999">Search is incident to arrest of unjustified on only two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.919" offset="413090">One, to prevent destruction of evidence that might be in the possession of the suspect and in this case the only evidence they’re looking for was a tattoo which is not susceptible to destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.172" offset="458125">And the second reason is to seize any weapons which the defendant might have in his possession which could endanger the arresting officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="814.785" offset="3364509">It is the view of the City of New Orleans that the matters, enlarged matters that the Court has asked the city here today on the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.795" offset="3408603">And we will try to eliminate any consideration of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.133" offset="3445906">Now, it is significant in the city’s view that enlisting authorities, the American Civil Liberties Union which submitted an outstanding brief, professional brief obviously written by professional lawyers in a professional manner, listed the Fourth and Sixth Amendment and did not cite in its list of authorities of Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.131" offset="3545903">I am asking this Court to consider the Fifth Amendment in this case only bring it into the case only for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.734" offset="3584355">It is important because the Wainwright forces cite Miranda, Escobedo, Gideon versus Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.620" offset="3631898">I’ll take those three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.735" offset="3640362">First, Gideon versus Wainwright, the Sixth Amendment, this is not that type of Sixth Amendment Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.251" offset="3662409">There is no question that Mr. Wainwright was represented at all times by counsel in the court room.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.861" offset="3688845">So let’s look at Escobedo and Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.268" offset="3702533">There is no question, there are no confessions here to suppress, no admissions, no statements of anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.607" offset="3731895">So if then we cite Escobedo and Miranda just in reference to the Sixth Amendment, leave out the Fifth Amendment considerations of Escobedo and Miranda, we’re only citing half of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.554" offset="3783617">Escobedo and Miranda primarily stands we submit for the introduction of confessions unlawfully obtained and this Court has held.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.664" offset="3840042">Correctly we think that a denial of counsel at the time when statements are made, would then rule out on the Miranda and on the Escobedo any incriminatory statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.645" offset="3896048">We bring the Fifth Amendment into this case to say there are no incriminatory statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.354" offset="3914856">There never were any statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.003" offset="3921439">There never were any confessions entered into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.128" offset="3933978">So Gideon versus Wainwright, Escobedo and Miranda go out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.254" offset="3958429">And we’ve met this issue head on.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.466" offset="3967310">We don’t want to cite the effective date of Escobedo and Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.289" offset="3982566">We wanted to meet the issues of Escobedo and Miranda, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.682" offset="4000120">Now let’s go to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.275" offset="4014540">The Fourth Amendment, all cases cited have to do with the suppression of illegally obtained evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.964" offset="4045260">There is no illegally obtained evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.123" offset="6317913">And when the police officer said that it was close, we don’t know which came first.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.847" offset="6396803">And the city has shown, and will show and that record shows, and the exact transcript for this, the man was charged with resisting an officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.809" offset="6508607">I direct this especially to Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.820" offset="6520728">There is not a man in this Court room, Mr. Justice Douglas, who is more concerned personally or more in agreement with you when you said in that 1951, I think it’s a Carignan Case, that is the time audit system of the police to arrest a man for vagrancy, or for a lesser charge, so they could investigate a greater charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.946" offset="6613201">There is no community in the nation who agrees more with that, that it’s a wrong practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.765" offset="6640473">With me personally, it’s a very important matter because there’s a lot of guilt that attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.047" offset="6661580">I was running the -- well the complaint desk for Mr. Leon Hubert between 1954 and 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.523" offset="6691464">And there is no doubt that prior to 1957, we charged everybody with 107 vagrancy pending investigation of everything from murder to rape, to incest, to petty larceny but the difference, it has not been done since 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.813" offset="6756665">I have made part of my response brief, an actual copy of the order put out by the police in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.765" offset="6788430">Mr. Hubert and I were instrumental in doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.676" offset="6800133">We searched it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.316" offset="6806716">We realized we were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.513" offset="6811523">We saw the error of our ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.496" offset="6819359">And so we came in with this order, police order, which says effective in August of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.356" offset="6850811">There will be no more arrests on vagrancy pending investigation of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.191" offset="6874216">And when you take the charge of vagrancy, it must stand on its own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.851" offset="6888845">And what did we do in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.247" offset="6898458">The thing that might be overlooked in this matter, since I was part and parcel of this bad system, if we charge a man with 107, pending investigation of murder, armed robbery, burglary, what not, if he were cleared on the burglary charge, the armed robbery, the 107 went out the window, we threw out the vagrancy charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.189" offset="6974213">That did not happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.561" offset="6983617">Mr. Wainwright was cleared as a suspect in this murder the very morning of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.459" offset="7003261">And yet the city persisted in prosecuting him on vagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.907" offset="7017054">The city persisted in going to that one resisting an arrest -- resisting an officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.949" offset="7041191">These were not holding charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.247" offset="7050386">As long as I am in the City of New Orleans, nobody will ever again take a lesser charge for purposes of pending investigation of a greater charge without running into a fight with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.950" offset="7097198">As Mr. Hubert and I, Jim Garrison he was part of that office, just beginning.</text>
