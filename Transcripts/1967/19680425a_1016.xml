            <text syncTime="1265.318" offset="5164596">And they looked around in the house and found in the kitchen, which was a common room of the house, a rifle, which was a common article of the household.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.841" offset="6750751">So for these reasons, the petitioner respectfully prays that the court to set aside the conviction of the petitioner and order that he be granted a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.913" offset="7102986">In other words, if they are silent, the death penalty is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.326" offset="7120645">If they make a recommendation of life imprisonment, that is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.632" offset="7137886">Now, I think the principle to be decided in this jury case has a great deal more significance for North Carolina in the future of its criminal procedure practices than perhaps the mere question of a single new trial of the man because of a possible error of this -- the search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.818" offset="7214686">So I'd like to say a little more about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.772" offset="7222418">As mentioned before, North Carolina does not by statute control the matter of challenge of a juror for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.567" offset="7257631">Whether you call it common law or whether it's been judicial practice over the years, certainly by court holding, the first general principle recognized is that a person who has biased may on the challenge be excused for cause which of course in no ways effects his right to take his full number for preemptory challenges which affixed by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.031" offset="7355538">Now, in our court, I -- but I'd like to say this, not only does the statute not cover it but actually our Supreme Court in North Carolina has not had squarely presented to it the question of how far must you prove the man who originally says he has opposed the capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.991" offset="7443310">In order to reach a point where he may be disqualified by challenged for bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.587" offset="7469746">But the assumption, underlying assumption as I read it in our court decisions, is that they assume he has been examined to the point that he could not in this particular case under any circumstances imposed the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.278" offset="7540485">Now the judge writing the case in the opinion below uses this sentence: Where a juror states in advance that under no circumstances would he accept the contentions or positions of a party which in this case would be the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.925" offset="7607045">He is not impartial to that party but as a corollary, he must necessary be partial to the adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.149" offset="7635989">And in this opinion below in the Bumper case, the judge did not discuss at much length to this but made great reference to a case a few months or few years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.772" offset="7686457">The Charles case in which Chief Justice Parker wrote at length on the disqualification of the juror by reason of bias that he was opposed to capital punishment and Judge Parker there again assumed also apparently that we are talking about situation where the man has said, “I cannot in this case” under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.187" offset="7772139">Not just a general -- I'm opposed to capital punishment attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.310" offset="7788648">And there again, the judge below holding Judge, the Chief Justice Parker, who in terms quoting ALR "upon the theory, the conscientious scrupulous against infliction of the death penalty under any circumstances or equivalent beliefs equally disqualify a jury for cause of prosecution for a corrupted crime for so long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.520" offset="7881435">So I think we can fairly say that although the question hasn't been presented in exactly that fashion our court has adopted the position that it does not make this test, that it was much discussed in the Witherspoon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.421" offset="7945070">Now as -- going a little further to the practice, defense counsel, I suggested that every juror was questioned to that point in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.163" offset="7984044">I think in all fairness to him of the 16 excluded, perhaps two of them were questioned quite that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.804" offset="8022601">Two of them, one of them merely said, “I do not believe in capital punishment”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.156" offset="8039946">It's Ms. (Inaudible) record page 19 and Ms. Fuller record page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.032" offset="8063457">I have conscientious or religious group was against the imposition of the capital punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.256" offset="8136391">Now I take it, if there's error, it would be in a systematic exclusion of a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.359" offset="8168782">And I think, in the light of what our Supreme Court has said, the court practice in this case of 14 of the 16 were excluded only when they did make this proper test that we could not well say that an error as to two indicated in a systematic exclusion on the part of the state or the court system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2692.739" offset="10874337">As I understood Mr. Smith, it is his belief that if the jury could not agree on whether there should be the death penalty or life imprisonment should be imposed that the defendant would be entitled to a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.463" offset="10957197">I understood him say that for instance if one juror held out against capital punishment that that would have to result in a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2748.965" offset="11099199">If they return a verdict of guilty, then they're instructed to consider whether they will recommend life imprisonment or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.880" offset="11122918">I think once they voted guilty, they have a verdict of guilty and would come out with that and could only come out with a recommendation of mercy or life imprisonment rather if they all agree.</text>

            <text syncTime="2818.484" offset="11377351">First, the officers went into the lady's house and said, ”We want to search.</text>

            <text syncTime="2831.868" offset="11430849">I didn't even look at that again till the next day because I know this general principle is rather hard to overcome the presumption that the consent was merely acquiescence to the authority of the law under such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.308" offset="11496573">However that may be, that is what they did and the question is, under those circumstances, is it still possible to consent?</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.635" offset="11545893">You cannot volunteer a consent to be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.942" offset="11559163">The only way I know would be to try to determine the frame of mind of this person, the attitude with which she did or did not consent.</text>
