            <label>Mr. Harold Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="157.676" offset="734124">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.755" offset="738408">Now, in this case, the A &amp; S Electric Company filed an arrangement for the benefit of creditors, Chapter XI proceeding and was subsequently adjudicated a bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.136" offset="823881">In the bankruptcy proceeding, the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry, which supervises all of the various trust funds, filed a claim on behalf of several trust funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.389" offset="900890">One was the Welfare and Pension Fund of the electrical industry, which was Welfare and Pension Fund as distinguished from the annuity plan in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.896" offset="946970">Another was a vacation fund; another was the employees' Disability Fund where the employee was to contribute for the state disability; and a number of others, including the annuity fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.793" offset="1010500">The total amount of the claim was some $10,000 but the payment to the annuity plan amounted to $5114 and covered some 40 employees who are employed there to whom moneys were owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.616" offset="1097853">And this annuity plan was established Your Honors in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.156" offset="1123976">It is a plan which was unique at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.103" offset="1143829">A simple plan but there wasn't a similar plan in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.938" offset="1167130">What happened when a collective bargaining agreement was negotiated, Your Honors, was that the union in negotiating an agreement requested that an annuity plan should be established and instead of the wage rate being increased with the result that there would be a withholding tax on the increased wages, deemed it advisable for the benefit of its members to provide them with security when they retired, when they're permanently disabled, if they left the industry and to the Armed Services or in case of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.811" offset="1362631">So instead of taking an increase in wages to the extent of $4 a day, they agreed that this $4 a day should be submitted to this annuity plan so that they would save the withholding tax at the time the wages were paid and would pay the taxes at a later date when they retire or in the event of death, which would be in a much lower bracket.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.158" offset="1495960">Now, this is not to be criticized as the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.833" offset="1514663">It's a very laudable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.726" offset="1526262">This plan was approved by the Treasury Department of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.226" offset="1544234">This government -- this country has been thinking in terms of security for people so that they do not become the subjects of charity in case of death or disability or upon retirement, and the thought was that these fixed interests, when the man retired, should supplement his regular pension which he received from the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.760" offset="1646425">In case he became disabled that he should have relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.319" offset="1660635">In case he left the industry, he should have relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.537" offset="1673488">In case of death, then in addition to the moneys which was credited to his account, the equity, a sum would be paid of a $125 a month to the widow who was usually the designated beneficiary until the equity was entirely paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.072" offset="1759692">And in addition thereto, there would be approximately $5,000 in death benefit paid to over a $125 a month which $5,000 death benefit was earned from the investment of the payments made by the employers and which would be invested in earned income.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.239" offset="1844328">In addition to that, on the moneys that were on deposit, there would be interest credited which has been done over the last several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.159" offset="1888005">Now, in this case, we claim that this case is different and can be distinguished from the Embassy case on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.660" offset="1958013">In the Embassy case, the payment was made for the purpose of purchasing life insurance, medical benefits and surgical benefits, which were all contingent on the happening of an event.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="483.997" offset="2039411">Do you remember whether the life insurance was a term insurance or was it straight life?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="493.848" offset="2078804">Yes, and that was all contingent.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.195" offset="2096149">If a man left the industry, he would have no interest in the life -- he had no benefit on the life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.279" offset="2120495">If he didn't become sick or needed no surgical benefit, he received no benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.349" offset="2144737">This case is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.374" offset="2152887">This is $4 a day instead of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.107" offset="2163754">It's fixed in a man's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.451" offset="2181204">It must be paid to him whether he retires, whether he is disabled, whether he leaves the industry, whether he dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.219" offset="2216208">Secondly, in the Embassy case, this Court spoke in terms that I think it was $8 a month was paid for each workmen, and the Court stated, it had no relation to the production or times or conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.496" offset="2301367">In this case, the $4 a day is a time and condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.385" offset="2328952">The $4 a day is paid when and only if the man works and produces a days work.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.254" offset="2364374">In other words, it is the same situation as if it were $4 an hour or $5 an hour plus $4 away a day, which are his wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.896" offset="3090996">Yes, and I might say that every single month, and this is not disputed, the annuity plan of the Electrical Industry sends to each participant of the plan a statement like a bankbook which shows how much money he has credited to his account and at the end of the year, the statement contains likewise a crediting of the amount of interest that has been earned and the moneys deposited to his account.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.872" offset="3218892">Now, in the Embassy case, the Court spoke about the purpose of Section 64a (2), was to provided a protective cushion in times of financial distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.774" offset="3318471">Of course, this is not in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.807" offset="3334562">It was a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.016" offset="3347414">I think the Court can take judicial notice of the fact that in case of bankruptcy, before the estate of a bankrupt, estate is wound up when the wages -- the priority wages are paid, it may be a period of a year or two or three may elapse till the thing is wound up.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.298" offset="3424528">Now, I agree with the Court on protective cushion and this is the purpose why this plan was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.069" offset="3463607">This provides a protective cushion to the man who is disabled, the man who has retired, the man in the event of his death plus payments taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.722" offset="3646255">And if the annuity plan didn't pay them their right, they will have a right to go into court under the decisions and collect the moneys due them under the provisions of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.494" offset="3701321">The cases covering this point are in my brief and I won't argue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.459" offset="3717204">Now, I do want to spend a minute on the question that in a case decided after the Embassy case by this Court in 1962 in the Sulmeyer against Southern California Pipe Trades Company case, the Court of Appeals held there “That moneys contributed to a vacation and holiday fund, and earmarked for the benefit of the participants, constituted wages within the meaning of Section 64(2)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act”.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.028" offset="3891493">The Court in that case, despite the Embassy case, distinguished it and held that they were entitled to priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.400" offset="3941021">The government would distinguish that case on the ground that in the Sulmeyer case, the withholding taxes were taken out when it was paid when, Your Honors, the Court in the Embassy case makes no mention of withholding taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.113" offset="4039868">The Bankruptcy Act was adopted originally in 1841 long before we ever had any income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.527" offset="4073514">It was within the contemplation of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.473" offset="4089292">Secondly, the Bankruptcy Act is not predicated on a definition that it should be given into a priority, provided that withholding tax is not taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.225" offset="4332231">In the first place, it is my contention that under the particular facts of this case, of this particular case, it's fixed vested interest which constitute wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.458" offset="4393253">Secondly, under the amendments of the Bankruptcy Act, which has been spoken about, they refer to lengthening and shortening the period that It was a bankrupt to State, increasing or decreasing the amounts of the priorities, inclusion of individuals who are not prior included within the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.494" offset="4513311">To say, distinct say point is that the attempts which were made in Congress to amend the Bankruptcy Act refer in language to all fringe benefits which could include welfare, pension, vacation, annuity and a month or two about the fringe benefits which are far greater than the situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.969" offset="4639222">And in this same connection, may I point out, if you consider the proposed amendments, to Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, how can one reconcile that with the provisions, with the decision in the Sulmeyer case which did grant the priority by Court of Appeals and which were related to the fringe benefit namely holiday and pension funds fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.558" offset="4773595">The next point, I'm going to make on this point, Your Honors, and I'd like to have permission of the Court to submit a letter which I received from Congressman Leonard Foxely (ph) who introduced all of these Bills in Congress, which shows that these Bills were produced/introduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.128" offset="5359888">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.953" offset="5379218">I think it's important in this case not to loss sight of the fact that the issue is not whether the petitioner has a just claim provable in bankruptcy, but the issue is whether Congress has seen fit to give the petitioner's claim priority over other just claims that are provable in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.084" offset="5483708">Now it's elementary that under our bankruptcy system, losses are suffered by creditors recognized by Congress as having just claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.409" offset="5524982">We do not appropriate public funds in order to pay all the just claims in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.862" offset="5550791">They can be paid only to the extent that there are assets in the estate available to cover them and priorities are preferred status which can be achieved only through subsidization by other creditors whose just claims will be wholly or partially eclipsed by payment of the priority claim in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.804" offset="5662595">It happens that in this case, the contest is between a claim under the second priority and the government's claim under the fourth priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.447" offset="5701151">But of course, the issue of statutory interpretation transcends the facts of this particular case and its resolution will affect the distributions in all bankruptcy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.343" offset="5764786">Now, Congress has been very cautious in granting priorities as this Court has noted on many occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.137" offset="5803969">The Court, in Nathanson against the National Labor Relations Board, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas, pointed out that the theme of the Bankruptcy Act is equality of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.820" offset="5866663">At the outset then, before addressing ourselves to the relevant statutory provisions and cases, which of course must govern the case, it might be observed that at least in ordinary human affairs, when there is a time of financial exigency, the tendency is not to give primacy at all cost to continuing to put money aside for anticipated future needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.680" offset="6010128">It might have been as an original proposition seem somewhat remarkable if Congress were to single out for among all the just claims on the estate and at the time of bankruptcy, contributions owing to a pension fund, anyone's pension fund as being a claim of such pressing need and of such overriding importance as to require subsidization at the expense of the other just claims on the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.323" offset="6144711">Well, but of course, the case must be governed and controlled by what Congress has done in the statute and the interpretations that have been rendered, but keeping in mind again in the words of this Court in the Nathanson case, that if one claimant is to be preferred over others, the purpose should be clear from the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.960" offset="6399248">In Embassy, the situation was different in the sense that there's no money that was credited to the account of the individual workers as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.321" offset="6552639">I think that the phrase “Wages due to workman” as used in Section 64a and the second priority was very carefully interpreted by the Court in Embassy, not in a mechanical, technical way, but in an interpretation based on the review of the entire history of that provision and an assessment of the statutory purpose in granting that priority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.490" offset="6721285">It reflects on some $8 per month for each workman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.546" offset="6737586">The amount is without relation to his hours, workers, wages or productivity, it is due to the trustees not the workman and the latter has no legal interest in it whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.758" offset="6794428">A workman cannot even compel payment by defaulting employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.166" offset="6828074">In other words, that looks as a -- reads as if the Court was quite concerned with the particulars of the arrangement?</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.700" offset="6874154">As a matter of fact Mr. Justice Fortas, most of the same things can be said about the present contributions, but I think that the essential part of the rationale in Embassy, after an examination of these individual attributes of the contribution and what the Court subsequently have used as the guiding post in such cases as Sulmeyer as to be found on the next page in the opinion on page 33 in the last paragraph that begins on that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.059" offset="7027649">After the Court satisfied itself that the terms of the statute do not require that these contributions be held to be within the meaning of the priority, the Court said, “Thus, they cannot be treated as being within the clear, unequivocal language unless it is clear that they satisfy the purpose for which Congress established the priority”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.265" offset="8596459">I think under the rationale of Embassy, Embassy was really a closer case with typical workman covered than this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.067" offset="8635643">The rationale really is based in that case on a look at the history of the statute and the purpose which that priority must be deemed to have served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.995" offset="8687365">And in interpreting the provision, the Court very carefully noted that from its inception in 1841 and throughout its history, the wage priority has always been limited in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.214" offset="8756224">It has been limited in the dollar amount that will be awarded to each claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.517" offset="8777435">It has been limited in the period of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.668" offset="8794049">Presently, the dollar amount is $600 maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.707" offset="8810245">The period of coverage must be earned within three months of the employer's bankruptcy in order to come within the wage priority; and thirdly, it has been limited in terms of the kinds of employee's eligible, which is a particularly interesting limitation in terms of the interpretation to be given to the priority, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.951" offset="8915153">For example, cases have held the following kinds of employees not to be eligible to receive the priority: accountants, actors, buyers, designers, editors, engineers, foremen, teachers and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.466" offset="8993207">It has been a difficult matter of statutory interpretation, but it is quite clear that Congress was attempting to identify a particular category of employees who would be particularly vulnerable to the exigencies of the period of unpaid wages and should be afforded some special protection in order to equalize their status with the status of other creditors of the State such as the kinds of employees I just mentioned or any other creditors who have afforded to the petitioner in bankruptcy their services or their label or their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.598" offset="9161749">And the purpose then of awarding the priority was the limited one of equalizing the status of the workman who were thought to be in a more financially vulnerable position but not putting them in a more favorable position than the other creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.895" offset="9526941">Within this context that this Court in Embassy pointed out that the purpose was to provide the workmen a protective cushion against the economic displacement caused by his employer's bankruptcy and to the extent that a particular claim exceeds $600 or to the extent that a particular claimant was able to continue on the job for more than three months without being paid, Congress did not see fit to grant him priority as against other claimants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.458" offset="11029191">I meant the word to be helpful in understanding this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.507" offset="11045386">There's another problem in the present structure of the Act with recognition of these claims and that is the fact that Section 17 of the Act makes wage claims a non-dischargeable debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.358" offset="11112782">I've asked the Clerk for the convenience the Court to distribute the text of Section 17 to each of you because it wasn't included in the briefs and I've underlined the applicable provision there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.162" offset="11175999">You notice that it is virtually identical with the provision in the priority section with the exception that there is no limitation in Section 17 to $600.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.512" offset="11233468">And this Court recognized in the Embassy Restaurant case itself that the meaning of wages due to workmen in the two sections is intended to be the same and that is corroborated in the legislative history of Section 17, which we have cited in our brief in note 23 on page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.585" offset="11321762">Yet, the Court has said that “In view of the well-known purposes of the Bankruptcy Law, exceptions to the operation of its discharge thereunder should be confined to those plainly expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.182" offset="11388113">There's a -- the tendency has been, not only in the courts but in the Congress itself to construe the discharge provision very narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.417" offset="11433044">And when Congress amended Section 17 in 1966 so as to decrease the extent to which tax claims are not discharged, the House report noted that nondischargeability “operates in a manner which is unfairly discriminatory against the private individual or the unincorporated small businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.308" offset="11540564">Because in most cases, when a corporation is the petitioner in bankruptcy, that the nondischargeability of the debt is without significance because the corporation is liquidated after the bankruptcy proceedings, but these debts remained with individuals and partnerships and small businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.508" offset="11621439">Now, if Congress were to change the rule of the Embassy case, it might well decide not to make fund contributions a nondischargeable debt even if it wished to grant them priority and it's certainly might further decide that their priority should be subordinate to the present wage claim priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.694" offset="11714121">Indeed, the Bills that have been introduced expressly provided that the priority to be granted by an extension of the wage claim would be subordinate to the present wage claim and that if there were not assets enough to pay both the worker and the fund, the worker would be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.478" offset="11813282">These are reasons why it might seem more advisable for Congress to consider how to accommodate the structure of the Act to granting of the claim priority that the petitioner has asked in this Court to grant if indeed Congress thinks that such a priority should be granted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.285" offset="11904502">In the nine years since the decision in the Embassy Restaurant case, Congress has been most unresponsive to Bills that have been introduced in every session to repeal that case by statutory amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.568" offset="11965628">And this is true even though --</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.395" offset="12068968">And in this particular instance, it seems it's especially questionable to attribute the failure of Congress to take action to congressional neglect of the subject due to oppressive other affairs because the fact is the Congress has in 1966 amended Section 64 in other respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.046" offset="12163532">And in 1967, it completely reenacted the Section as we noted in our brief at page 11.</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.375" offset="12540844">And in fact, it is rather difficult to imagine any interest group of comparable political influence that would be motivated to oppose these amendments that have been submitted year after year.</text>
