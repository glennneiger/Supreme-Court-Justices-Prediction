            <text syncTime="44.232" offset="280325">It involves the control of the retail price of the Globe-Democrat newspaper to home delivery customers on a suburban route in St.Louis.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.579" offset="385651">In 1961, the Globe-Democrat took the position that the home delivery carriers were not employees but were independent merchants and they took the position that they would not renew the collective bargaining agreement with the carrier's union when it expired in May of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.163" offset="511979">It did expire, it was not renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.023" offset="523473">The policy statement of the newspaper expressly says that in its position, in its view, this home delivery carriers are independent merchants.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.314" offset="848645">He had employees occasionally whom he paid and his wife helped him quite often with respect to clerical manners, people calling the house in order to make changes and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.480" offset="893262">Whenever he had employees, he paid this out of his proceeds, the difference between the prices that he paid and charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.648" offset="929938">In 1961, the Globe-Democrat having decided that it did not chose to make deliveries to employees on its some 172 routes that one of the deal of independent merchants nevertheless wanted to control the price at which the customer bought the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.685" offset="1030144">And the facts set forth in the amicus brief here or make clear of why that is, the charge that they are able to make for advertising depends on the size of their readership and therefore they want to keep the price down to their ultimate customer and get as much readership as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.021" offset="1107466">They -- therefore, the newspaper therefore published daily their suggested resale price in their newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.132" offset="1139858">And in 1961, this was set at a dollar and 60 cents a month for the daily paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.552" offset="1169533">Mr. Albrecht charged a dollar and 70 cents a month or 10 cents a month more for the daily paper than the suggested resale price of the Globe-Democrat to persons who did not pay in advance.If they paid in advance, he charged a dollar and 60 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.652" offset="1237974">From time to time, beginning in 1961, customers wouldn't see the suggested price in the newspaper, call into the newspaper office and make a complaint that they were charged a dollar 70 or more than the suggested resale price.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.653" offset="1302026">And when this occurred, it was the policy of the newspaper, the circulation director, to get in touch with the carrier, with Mr. Albrecht to warn him that he was charging more than their suggested price, to tell him that they insisted that he charge the suggested price.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.385" offset="1376946">This happened from time to time between 1961 and May 20, 1964, on at -- on two occasions in 1961 or 1962, the circulation director talked by phone with Mr. Albrecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.675" offset="1442043">And in 1962, he also had Mr. Albrecht into the office and discussed it with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.486" offset="1469315">Mr. Albrecht continued to charge a dollar and 70-cent price, and on May 20, 1964, the newspaper sent him a letter in which they enclosed another letter which they proposed to send to all of the people on -- within the territory of Mr. Albrecht's route.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.533" offset="1549458">Now this letter would inform these people that they were paying more than the suggested price and would offer to have the paper delivered to them at the suggested price of a dollar and 60 cents if they chose to have this done.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.598" offset="1621765">On May 20th, this letter was sent out to all of the people in Mr. Albrecht's route.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.622" offset="1645902">It was followed subsequently by telephone solicitation by a circulation company mainly Circulation Sales Company, which involve quite a number of hours of calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.661" offset="1698043">There were three persons employed, 13 hours a day and a director of this company estimated that they call for about two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.287" offset="1732524">This was followed up by a door-to-door solicitation by boys who were hired by the circulation company and instructed by the Globe-Democrat.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.603" offset="1929801">The result of this solicitation was according to the uncontradicted testimony of Mr. Albrecht that people he'd known for 20 years would meet him on the street and refuse to speak to him, his customers call him up, cursed him, call him a cheat and a thief, people moved away from him in church and this was effective cooperation -- or was effective coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.951" offset="2047143">For a little over for about three years from 1961 to 1964, the Globe-Democrat had been trying to persuade Mr. Albrecht to charge a dollar and 60 cents instead of a dollar 70 cents and have not been able to persuade him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.911" offset="2123003">Within about 20 days after this solicitation began, Mr. Albrecht had been subjected to this abuse, he had lost over 300 of his 1200 customers and he was forced to reduce his price to their suggested price, so you had him clubbed into compliance with their resale price maintenance so there's no question that this was effective coercion.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.843" offset="3046693">This has not seriously been argued in this case for the very simple reason that it -- all of the facts clearly show that under the rule of good faith competition in the restatement Section 709 on the early leading case, Tuttle versus Buck, this was not good faith competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.161" offset="3132061">It's absolutely clear they were never in the carrier business.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.156" offset="3143973">They said they didn't want to be in the carrier business.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.154" offset="3155989">When they took these 300 customers away, they didn't even assert any proprietary right over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.262" offset="3176469">They didn't view them as having become their customers at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.426" offset="3193083">They advertised for another carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.111" offset="4031822">With respect to resale price maintenance in a situation such as this, where the seller's action is to hold down his customer's price to the disadvantage of the customer but to the advantage of the seller, then the question is extremely important what the effect of coercion is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.412" offset="4121057">Now in resale price maintenance cases, I think this Court has already clearly and unequivocally held that if the seller by means of coercion induces the cooperative action of third parties together with him and then brings this combination to bear against the customer in order to affect -- effect resale price maintenance, that this is a violation of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.810" offset="4258565">I think there's no question at that sort, the Beech-Nut case holds, there was no finding of agreements there, only that the coercion effected and arrangement that was the equivalent of an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.479" offset="4313318">Now then I think it's absolute this Court has also absolutely clearly and unequivocally held in the Simpson case, Simpson versus Union Oil, that if the coercion of the seller, not involving third persons at all but solely against the buyer, results in the buyer signing his name to a contract even though it's against his interest and whenever he can he will not abide by it and this case came up because he didn't abide by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.895" offset="4442990">But if that formality resulting from the coercion is to sign a contract, then that -- he's in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.636" offset="7937964">A fundamental question in this case was touched at by Mr. Justice Fortas a moment ago when he pointed out that this case had been tried to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.919" offset="7995016">And this was done, not at the request of the defendant in the trial court but at the request of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.775" offset="8022497">Page 7 of the transcript you will see that in the bottom of the complaint that plaintiff said -- the plaintiff request a trial by jury of all the issues herein pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.418" offset="8077040">Now we had a trial by jury of all the issues here and pleaded and they lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.680" offset="8102118">And they took an appeal to the Court of Appeals, and he did alleged error in the trial of the case and the submission of the case in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.214" offset="8148198">But in this proceeding, in this certiorari, no error, not any error is alleged as a ground of reversal and no relief is prayed for except outright reversals, not remand for a new trial because of an error in the charge of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.744" offset="8234297">The question presented appears at page 2 of the petitioner's brief and the question presented is only whether as a matter of law, a newspaper's actions of soliciting away the customers are in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.091" offset="8303783">Similarly, the prayer of the petition which appears at page 32 of the petitioner's brief is simply, petitioner respectfully prays the Court to reverse for decis -- reverse the decision below and direct the judgment be entered for the petitioner Albrecht on the manner of liability and the trial be had on the amount of damages resulting from the unlawful solicitations and unlawful termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.199" offset="8412139">But the only question before this Court is, shall the case be remanded with instructions to the District Court to enter a judgment that this defendant has violated a criminal statute which raises before the Court a most vital constitutional question which is thoroughly briefed in the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.989" offset="8507329">This Court has no constitutional jurisdiction to make such an order as plaintiff seeks here because the predicate of liability here is a violation of a criminal statute, a misdemeanor enacted by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.728" offset="8578278">And the relief sought is the punishment of the defendant, treble-damages has to be a punishment because the cons -- the bill of rights says that no fact found by a jury can be otherwise reexamined.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.307" offset="8916616">And the question really presented here is whether on the record in this case, the Court shall adjudge the respondent guilty of the commission of a federal crime which is the predicate of recovery here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.555" offset="8965622">It has to find a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act but for any liability can arise Your Honors have held that treble-damages aren't punishment, punishment is protected by the bill of rights except imposition by reason of the requirements of the bill of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.118" offset="9059871">Now I have briefed this, there are 40 cases cited in the petition -- on the petition -- on the respondent's motion to dismiss and 28 cases from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.729" offset="9110340">The constitution -- the legislative history of the enactment of this Section is also set forth in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.027" offset="9139493">Time of course did not permit me to go into that at any length but to answer Your Honor's question, I do contend that to instruct a verdict which would have the result of imposing punishment upon the defendant for the violation of a misdemeanor statute is protected by the bill of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.605" offset="9221831">May I turn if you please to the -- what I might call the antitrust case that is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.593" offset="9249729">Mr. Dorsey is somewhat at error in the origin of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.314" offset="9272613">It is not true that the Globe-Democrat told the plaintiff here and others in his position that they would deal with him no longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.957" offset="9311169">There was a contract between the -- a so-called union of carriers of these newspapers and the defendant and it was the union itself including Albrecht that notified the Globe-Democrat that it would no longer abide by this contract and didn't consider itself to be bound that the parties weren't going to have anything to do with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.939" offset="9407091">Now the contract while informed, a labor contract was actually merely a matter of convenience and it reserved the right to the newspaper to set the retail price of the newspaper unilaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.948" offset="9467173">And at page 56 of the record, you will see that when the union teminated the contract relationship, the newspaper said very well, “These are the circumstances under which we will permit you to sell our newspapers in your territories.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.584" offset="9537703">And they're all set out and there is no doubt that they were followed in this case, they appear on pages 56 and 57 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.814" offset="9582634">And they say that we will permit you although we can't set your territories and although we reserve the right to terminate the territorial sale of newspapers by you in this area, we recognized that people do sometimes buy and sell these routes between themselves and we will not object to someone else to whom you wish to sell it, appointing him as a news dealer in this area by reason of the fact that he is paying something for it although we do not recognize any property rights with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.181" offset="9720142">And we say that it is necessary to the prosecution of the newspaper enterprise that a minimum price be maintained -- a maximum price I should say be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.782" offset="9778552">And if you violate this maximum price, we will compete with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.403" offset="9796942">This is what we said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.517" offset="9805406">Now Albrecht paid $11,000 for this route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.506" offset="9821393">He was a man of little education, no business background, he had been a route salesman for a bread company and some others and had done a little farming, and he had to mortgage his house to raise the $11,000 and make some notes to the fellow that he -- from whom he bought this route, and this was his all, this route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.001" offset="9911359">Now Your Honor said in Parke, Davis that Mr. Dorsey is fond of reporting that we cannot go further than a mere declination to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.721" offset="9966216">Now it's a position with the respondent here that in the facts of this case, we didn't go as far as the mere refusal to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.493" offset="10005295">It -- does -- I think the wording of Mr. J -- Mr. Brennan's -- Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion as a simple refusal of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.875" offset="10038836">A simple refusal to sell in this case wouldn't have been very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.217" offset="10060257">For Albrecht, it would have been a complete wipeout of his entire investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.359" offset="10080841">The mortgage on his house would have come due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.942" offset="10095156">And what the Globe-Democrat said, instead of saying, “Sorry, we're not going to sell you anymore,” is “We'll continue to sell you and we'll sell alongside of you as long as you insist upon setting your own price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.727" offset="10154297">And therefore, we will make available to the people in your territory, the newspaper at the price which we think it ought to be sold at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.237" offset="10188361">And we continued that way for several months, he's selling at his price and I suppose later as the record tells he reduced his price, at least he so testified but it was not until this suit was filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.790" offset="11470555">A newspaper after four hours has gone by, is only good to start a fire with or line a garbage pale, it isn't any good as a commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.875" offset="11502843">Therefore, it has to be distributed to home delivery promptly and right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.783" offset="11526457">This is the only way it can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.642" offset="11537951">Therefore, I think there's an immense difference between the system, the distribution between automobiles and newspapers which can't be reconciled by what I might call a doctrine error or approach to the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.456" offset="11641187">If I may develop that a little bit further, there's undoubtedly the right of the manufacturer of the newspaper to sell directly to the reader.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.095" offset="11683715">We can with our own employees deliver the newspaper to the reader's door instead of through independent merchant as we do now and as we did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.901" offset="11726973">And of course since three-fourths of the newspaper's revenue comes from the advertising rather than from the circulation revenue, the newspaper is going to see that the price is kept down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.207" offset="11788204">From the standpoint of the news dealer, he is better off to sell a hundred newspapers at a dollar and 500 newspapers at 10 cents because it's a lot less expensive to make such delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.909" offset="11851003">He said, he would do so of course if he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.164" offset="11859989">This would be death to the newspaper, couldn't stand that because its (Inaudible) line rate would go to (Inaudible) and it wouldn't sell any advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.063" offset="11891649">So, if it is impossible for a newspaper to require its news dealers to maintain a certain minimum price, the only alternative for the newspapers is to wash out all such people and to wash out their investments, their $11,000 or $20,000 whatever they may be, and deliver the newspapers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.965" offset="11991228">This is the economic consequence of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.525" offset="12005439">But I think more than that, if Your Honor please the fact that there must be an immediate delivery that the economic necessity of the sale of the newspaper requires the delivery, requires a different approach to the territorial franchise as in the case of an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.721" offset="12074297">There's no difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.657" offset="12077955">If I'm going to pay $2-3000 for an automobile, I don't mind to be driving a hundred or 200 miles to get a better price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.289" offset="12108570">And an automobile in itself of course is a mobile device.So perhaps this makes a distinction between the Chevrolet case or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.964" offset="12147231">But I would like to turn to a question which Mr. Justice Brennan asked Mr. Dorsey a while ago and that is, who is the combination with?</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.783" offset="12282546">Now at the time the charge was being made up, after all the evidence was in, the plaintiff saw that it was very awkward to suppose to the jury a combination with parties unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.240" offset="12340328">So he amended his complaint at the time of the charge to say that you combined with plaintiff's customers and/or merely circulation sales which was a circulation company and/or George Kroner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.871" offset="12902902">He's in no position to ask the Court to make an instruction of this sort, where there are alternative pleadings and of course you can have alternative pleadings and alternative submissions because the rule of law is, that a jury may select between alternatives which are well-pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.400" offset="12980955">But this does not mean and the reason for that of course is because where alternatives exist and are supported in the record reasonable minds can differ but the predicate of a directive verdict is that reasonable minds cannot differ and therefore, where he submits a pleading and this was done not back in the pretrial days, but after trial, at the time the charge was being made up, history was that there were seven alternative combinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.961" offset="13103208">Actually I think we've demonstrated in our brief that there was no combination with anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.785" offset="13122539">And this I think is the true position which the petitioner takes both in his brief and in his argument because the question presened does not predicate an agreement with anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.041" offset="13175515">The question presented on page 2 of their brief and also in the petition itself says nothing about a combination with anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.734" offset="13194324">It says, whether as a matter of law, a newspaper's actions of soliciting away the customers of one of his independent merchant carriers in order to induce him to comply with its suggested resale price and then terminating sales to him for his continued refusal to agree to comply are in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.898" offset="13294947">So that he would have you say that merely the combination between the coercer and the coercee constitutes a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.511" offset="13353462">And yet the statute itself, the wording of the statute requires that there'd be a contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise or a conspiracy in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.649" offset="13401945">None such was pleaded.None such is showed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.471" offset="13417305">The rule of law which the petitioner strives for would not require any such -- the existence of anything of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.580" offset="13457742">So we feel Your Honors that there is no jurisdiction here to afford the relief which the plaintiff wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.225" offset="13484283">And in any event, it is not available to him under the theory of the case in which it was tried below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.109" offset="13511764">And that lastly, the statement of law upon which he predicates his claim for relief is not in accordance either with the statute or with the decided cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.326" offset="13552724">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.071" offset="13571636">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.200" offset="13656168">We didn't allege that there was error in the instructions when it went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.397" offset="13685008">But our feeling was that a -- since all of the facts are there, there's no factual question to be decided that there would be no question sending -- there's no point in sending this back for a new trial but -- and so we asked direction that you direct that judgment be added for petitioner on the liability in the new trial solely on damages.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gray L. Dorsey</label>
            <text syncTime="3455.733" offset="13926275">Well, I simply would be -- I think that applies in this way that it is unreasonable per se when price fixing has occurred and there's no need to inquire whether this price-fixing affected a substantial amount of the market and that's their -- I think there's no need to inquire in this case with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.717" offset="14026271">This matter of the unconstitutionality of the treble-damage action, I really think that there's nothing substantial there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.330" offset="14064724">Over a hundred years ago, this Court said that punitive damage has been a part of the Civil Law for over a hundred years at that time so that for more than 200 years, it's been accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.162" offset="14112057">It's logically somewhat anomalist but it's a good bargain to get at the expense -- slight expense of logic to get a doctrine that has been useful and has been used for over 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.915" offset="14167019">In the House of Lords in 1964 did reconsider on the merits and decided to leave it in as a part of the Civil Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.554" offset="14197635">Now, I would like to point out that Mr. Hocker is not correct that the carriers wrote -- the carrier's business manager wrote to the business manager of the newspaper, called attention of the fact that the contract expiration date was coming up on February 16 of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.287" offset="14288541">And on February 17, wrote offering to negotiate for a new contract and that the newspaper wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.418" offset="14317066">Then shortly before that expiration date in May saying they would not negotiate because the carriers are independent merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.559" offset="14353638">Now, I think really this argument that they didn't go beyond because they were more kind to Albrecht that -- is really ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.434" offset="14401076">It's not a question of whether they were kind to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.360" offset="14412779">It's a question of whether in the matter of coercion they went beyond announcement and declination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.621" offset="14441827">They clearly did go beyond even if it were disastrous for Albrecht to stand on his right, he had the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.950" offset="14471189">And furthermore, it was not disastrous because it misrepresents to say that by refusing the sell to him, they wiped out his investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.510" offset="14505462">They don't wipeout his investment, he owns the route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.545" offset="14517582">The contracts to deliver to those people in Kirkwood belong to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.341" offset="14532733">He bought them from the previous man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.827" offset="14542660">He had the right to sell them to the next man and he did sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.602" offset="14557811">It wasn't any great act of kindness to give him 60 days to sell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.876" offset="14574843">They didn't have anyone who had the right to deliver to those people and they could only agree to sell to someone who did have that right and that man could only get that right from Albrecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.815" offset="14618624">Now, it's true that the newspaper has the need to control price because of their short shelf life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.986" offset="14647359">They certainly could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.130" offset="14651852">They could hire employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.958" offset="14659166">They could plan employee's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.528" offset="14669511">They could ensure the job security that the union contract ensures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.602" offset="14685811">They have been so kind to Albrecht that at the age of 50, he's out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.120" offset="14707858">He's done nothing except home delivery work for 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.490" offset="14725308">He's 50 years old, now he's terminated, he doesn't have a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.496" offset="14741400">If they want to ensure that they can charge the price, they can hire employees and deliver it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.573" offset="14769716">Kroner's -- was instructed at the time that he took over these 300 customers, that of course you know what our policy is, and it was clear that he understood that the condition of taking over these customers was that he would follow this resale price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.924" offset="14843068">So our position is Your Honor is that on the undisputed facts, that the coercion has clearly gone beyond prior announcement and mere declination to sell that the real protection of people in this situation would be for this Court unequivocally to rule that coerced this antagonistic coercive relationship between the buyer and the seller alone gives rise to an unlawful combination that that in any event if the Court chooses not to so rule, that there is the relationship between the Globe-Democrat, the customers of Albrecht, the circulation company and the other carrier, Kroner, that establishes a sufficient combination between them so that in this instance, there was a violation of the Act in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.364" offset="15036792">We feel that the only thing -- that there's no need for a new trial which should be directed on the matter of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.628" offset="15069915">Thank you.</text>
