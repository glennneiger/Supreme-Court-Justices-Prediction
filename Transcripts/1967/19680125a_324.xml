            <label>Mr. William H. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="55.255" offset="324420">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.551" offset="337586">In this case, the Norfolk and Western Railway is challenging an assessment of its rolling stock by the Missouri State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.980" offset="375306">In brief, its claim is that the assessment is so greatly in excess of the actual value of Missouri, of Norfolk and Western rolling stock that was in Missouri, that Missouri has placed out of state values on its tax rolls and that this is in violation of both the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.228" offset="480319">The question arises in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.208" offset="492231">Ordinarily, in the case of the of an interstate railroad, no particular unit of its rolling stock will be in a particular state permanently and yet it is said to be permanent presence in the state that gives a state jurisdiction to tax an object.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.056" offset="567568">But it's been recognized that it's proper for a state to be able to tax and reach in some manner the rolling stock that is constantly passing through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.041" offset="607587">So in recognition of this, this Court long ago reframed situs doctrines so as to permit the states to tax an average amount of rolling stock that was in the state, a fraction which will be constantly changing in content but which will be more or less stable in size of the entire uh complement of locomotives and cars that are on there, otherwise controlled by the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.271" offset="728482">The next step was to permit the states to determine the size of this fraction by the use of formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.757" offset="762441">Missouri assesses rolling stock according to one formula a form of the mileage or trackage formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.571" offset="797654">Under this formula, a railroad's mileage, branch line and main line in case of Missouri, mileage is computed as a total, as a percentage of its total such mileage and this percentage is then applied to a value ascertained for the entirety of the carrier's fleet of rolling stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.482" offset="893262">In other words, if a railroad had a 10% of its mileage in Missouri, Missouri would attribute to itself for property tax purposes 10% of that carrier's -- the value of that carrier's rolling stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.819" offset="962644">The premise for the use of this formula in both the Missouri Supreme Court and this Court has recognized this is that rolling stock is roughly, evenly divided throughout a railroad system.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.425" offset="1013112">Missouri mileage formula was first applied in the Norfolk and Western in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.711" offset="1034219">That was after the N&amp;W had acquired by lease all the properties of the Wabash Railroad.Before the -- before that lease, which took back at October 16, 1964, the Norfolk and Western did not operate in Missouri, although the Wabash and Lines in operations there.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.574" offset="1113631">The Missouri statute and terms applies to property owned hired or leased by a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.176" offset="1136097">On this basis, the Missouri's Tax Commission asked and received from the N&amp;W a detailed statement of its mileage owned or leased in Missouri and elsewhere and of its units of rolling stock and their value at cost less accrued depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.484" offset="1217285">Most of the cars and locomotives that the N&amp;W returned in this manner to the Tax Commission were coal carrying equipment used in the well known N&amp;W coal operation from the mines of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, to Tide Water and the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.965" offset="1299205">As it turned out, the Missouri mileage was about eight and a quarter percent of the N&amp;W's total mileage.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.791" offset="1334523">The Commission took 47% of this cost less depreciation figures that the N&amp;W had supplied as the value of its-- of its rolling stocks as the assessed or equalized value of the entire fleet of rolling stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.272" offset="1404426">It used that same 47% factor for all railroads in the state in that year and when applied to the equalized value of the entire fleet, the eight and a quarter percent mileage factor yielded an assessment of nearly $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.204" offset="1484152">It is that assessment of rolling stock that's in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.901" offset="1498990">It appeared suspect at once that assessment because in the previous year, the rolling stock of the Wabash in the hands of the Wabash had been assessed at only a little more than $9 million and there had been no change in the Missouri operations as a result of the lease of the properties to the -- to the N&amp;W such as would logically it was thought lead to any such inquiries in the value of the fleet that was in Missouri.</text>

            <text syncTime="2276.002" offset="9207411">Now on rolling stock, the way the Commission reaches its valuation is to depreciate and equalize the entire rolling stock so in that respect, in answer to your question well it would be yes, that there would be a larger valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.969" offset="9271254">Well we have one more thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.418" offset="9277001">First of all, we apply the equalization factor which 45, 47% then we apply the track formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.653" offset="9310020">So the chances of getting a larger figure would depend on the total of depreciated figure that we began with and unless that figure was obviously excessive, it would be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.121" offset="9935809">Mr. Allen has contended has contended that there's no relationship between enhanced value and allocation by a trackage format and they cannot be applied and I'm not quite sure whether he means a wholly inconsistent or whether it's a (Inaudible) account but that isn't true and has not been true since I think probably the Union Tank Line Company versus Wright because that same contention was made in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.054" offset="10039568">That you cannot use a proportion formula to allocate both intangible and tangible properties and this Court will not specifically deciding on that issue did reaffirm enhanced value so I don't think that that particular point has any validity whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.822" offset="10130683">In other words, it is our position that enhanced value does sustain it, that that is what the Missouri Supreme Court has recognized and we feel that it is very definitely a factor that at least must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.823" offset="10186689">Now, the appellants have not even recognized it, have not said how can it be computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.947" offset="10203199">They assert that it should be computed at some other phase of the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.187" offset="10220126">But they have not shown us what it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.990" offset="10235382">And apparently it either has no value or they are not recognizing it as having a value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.698" offset="10262131">And certainly, there's no question about it that it -- that there is enhanced value that accrues to the separate pieces of equipment being assessed when they're part of a going concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.093" offset="10307793">That particularly there is absolutely no surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.025" offset="10323466">So it is directly on that point that Missouri Supreme Court has affirmed this case and it is on that point that we feel that this Court should sustain this case.</text>
