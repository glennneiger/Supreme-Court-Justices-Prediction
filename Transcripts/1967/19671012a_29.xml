            <label>Mr. Emanuel Redfield</label>
            <text syncTime="17.668" offset="174059">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.709" offset="194226">This is an appeal from an order of the District Court of the Eastern District of New York in which a three-judge Court was convened, and the order denied the plaintiff's application for a temporary injunction and dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.759" offset="314389">This case and this review raises questions whether Section 781 (b) of the Penal Law, which was only a few weeks ago renown that Section 457 of the Election Law without change of content, and the question is whether that law is a prior restraint on speech, in that it forbids distribution of anonymous literature reweighting to, I'm paraphrasing the statute, elections of public offices and also with respect to amendments to the State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.756" offset="502366">And, it also raises the question whether the three-judge Court abused its discretion in abstaining from deciding the issue and in dismissing the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.117" offset="567881">The attack here by the appellant is on the face of the statute, and I should also mention that there are no issues of fact involved and, so much so, that at the hearing before the three-judge Court counsel stipulated that a final order might be entered in this case in view of the lack of dispute as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.292" offset="692537">I go back to the early beginnings of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.967" offset="715212">It had a history in the state of the art Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.899" offset="730990">A few days before the congressional elections in 1964, my client, Sanford Zwickler, stood in front of a democratic political club in Brooklyn New York, of which club the candidate then running for Congress was the leader and he distributed the leaflet which appears on page 6 of the record and -- which attacked this Congressional candidate's record with respect to his acts in Congress, and the leaflet bore no name or address and did not comply with a mandate of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.288" offset="964524">He was prosecuted in the Criminal Courts of New York and the constitutionality of the statute was attacked as being an infringement of his rights of free speech and repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.535" offset="1053550">That objection was overruled and, since there has been no controversy about the facts, he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.477" offset="1097331">An appeal was taken by his counsel to the Intermediate Appellate Courts and that Court reversed this conviction, did not pass upon the constitutionality of the law but merely said that there was not-- had not been sufficient proof of a quantity of literature having been distributed because the statute speaks of a distribution in quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.914" offset="1219062">The district attorney who was the defendant in this action pursued the case further to the Court of Appeals of New York, our highest Court, and that Court affirmed the prior reversal of the appellate term.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.023" offset="1307460">That affirmance was in December 1, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.758" offset="1330448">But, my client who was anxious to make such distribution but was afraid of being prosecuted again, he's a very simple person but he is civic minded, he's not a professional agitator, he hasn't such attainments, he wanted to make this distribution again and he still wishes to make distribution but he knows what he went through in his prior experience in New York Court by his arrest which was a very traumatic affect upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.014" offset="1491466">So, he started suit in the District Court of the Eastern District of New York in which he alleged in his complaint the facts which I've just stated of his prior conviction in the reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.995" offset="1571401">He also alleged that he desires to distribute this literature again for the election of 1966, at which the same Congressman was going to be a candidate, and he wishes to distribute it at subsequent times.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.640" offset="1649977">And, he also alleged that he wishes to distribute it in quantities of 1,000 copies or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.235" offset="1684355">He also stated which we could well understand, his fears on the matter and that he does not wish to exercise these rights unless he is protected by a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.448" offset="1761155">While this came on before, it convenes three-judge Court and that Court by a 2-1 decision held that it should abstain in the matter and dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.055" offset="1843597">In othre words it's rather odd that it abstain but refuse to hear, terminated the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.529" offset="1881527">It wrote three opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.865" offset="1886856">Each judge wrote an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.435" offset="1901066">The majority held that there was a case and controversy involved but abstained for two reason, as I make it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.836" offset="1950699">One is that since the State Courts provided a remedy by way of declaratory judgment, why he should've gone to the State Courts and not to the Federal Courts and, secondly, held that Douglas against Jeannette for that -- or at least lasted to the Court's discretion not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.476" offset="2053308">It sort of mandated the Court not to grant relief under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.895" offset="2082983">Judge Grosling wrote in a dissenting opinion, he held that there should not have been any abstention because, to him, the statute was clearly unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.866" offset="2142856">He held it so be -- for three different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.133" offset="2159888">He said the statute was overbroad because, by its text, it covers all campaign literature not merely scurrilous and false.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.296" offset="2220596">And, in any event, the statute covered ideas like the ones pertaining to amendments to the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.264" offset="2268453">And, the third reason he gave was that even if the statute were limited, the fault and scurrilous literature, as the Attorney General then urged as the proper interpretation of the statute, he said that this violated the Constitution because it was clearly an infringement of the right of free speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.070" offset="2611702">And, you'll find in the record on page 11 an affidavit by the Attorney General in which he stated that he participated in the enactment of the statute and that was the purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.463" offset="2677217">But, in the brief in this Court, on page 11, you will find that the Attorney General takes a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.132" offset="2723924">He states that the statute applies to all literature and by -- that is anonymous and by “all,” I suppose he means -- he includes the innocent or non-scurrilous literature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.586" offset="7397752">The Chief Justice asked how many states had statutes similar to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.705" offset="7418232">According to our brief, there are 36 states having -- 36 states having similar statutes and, in two states, the Supreme Court of each of the states of California and Pennsylvania have upheld the statutes against First Amendment challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.438" offset="7505168">In addition, the prototype of all of these statutes as in the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, Section 612, which was upheld there a few years ago in US against Scott, a District Court case, involving literature circulate with respect to Senator Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.555" offset="7605582">The origin of the statute goes back to the 1940 election when literature -- anonymous literature of highly emotional content was circulate throughout the country as a result of which the then Attorney General Jackson appointed a special assistant and a special grand jury as a result and the culmination of that was a recommendation which, among other things, recommended a statute similar to the one in New York now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.578" offset="7829713">It said in their report, “we recommend amending the Corrupt Practices Act to prohibit circulation through United States Mail of any and all literature, the purpose of which is to influence the election of candidates for federal office or presidential, advice presidential electors, or the enactment of the feet of measures before the Congress of the United States unless it is signed by the person or persons or committee or organization responsible for its circulation, together with their addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.792" offset="7966490">We also suggest that all such printed matter contained the names and addresses of the person, persons, committee, or organization responsible for the printing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.106" offset="8019780">In addition to that, on the Floor of Congress, there was much discussion about this recommendation particularly by Senator Gillette on the Congressional record who has copious references to the need for the legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.880" offset="8250911">Now, this statute does not, in any way, censor or prohibit the dissemination of any material at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.066" offset="8287587">It merely says, in substance, that if you're going to distribute literature with respect to any candidate or any proposition on the ballot, that you must identify in some way a name or the name of the organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2592.436" offset="10473096">And, the reason they went through the Federal Court route was that if they went through the State Court route and that they got up to the Court of Appeals and if the Court of Appeals were to declare the statute unconstitutional, then it could only get to this Court by the Attorney General of the state appealing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.678" offset="10722095">Well, he started an action in the New York Supreme Court -- New York County Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.508" offset="10745396">He got a decision which upheld the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.739" offset="10766294">He went directly to the New York Court of Appeals from that and in a space of four months, he got a decision from the New York Court of Appeals which held that the statute was unconstitutional, so that the process took four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.998" offset="10823346">Now, let's see what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.686" offset="10834108">The decision by the Court of Appeals here and the criminal prosecution, to which my adversary referred, took place on December 1, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.065" offset="10875591">He did not start this action in the District Court until the later part of April 1966.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.138" offset="10907878">Had he started the action in the New York Supreme Court, he would've had a decision by April 1966 because the New York Court of Appeals is up to date and there is no delay in New York State Courts on a motion for judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.780" offset="10986454">It's up to date.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.190" offset="11156146">And, when this case went into the Criminal Court, in the lower Criminal Court, the judge asked my adversary at the end of the people's case, he said “you move to dismiss on the ground there's no prima facie case,” and there wasn't a prima facie case because all the evidence that was there was that one circular -- the complainant one circular, no -- no question of quantity, and Mr. Redfield said, “No, I don't move to dismiss on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.429" offset="11281115">I move to dismiss on the ground that the statute is unconstitutional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.186" offset="11300133">And, when he got up to the Appellate Courts, he did the same thing, now, so that what he was trying to do was get a decision in the Criminal Court even though the case was insufficient factually to challenge the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.635" offset="11365961">And, in that way, we feel or we felt when this case was originally instituted that this was a situation arranged because they feel that the statute should be challenged and that the -- Mr. Zwickler set himself up as the pigeon for the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.289" offset="11468570">Now, in the -- in the Dombrowski case, the majority opinion points out that the statute was vague and it's the vagueness that caused this so-called chill, but this statute -- there's no claim in this case, there is no issue that the statute is vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.080" offset="11551744">In this case, the amicus brief is hard -- put to put in a suggestion of vagueness arising from the use of the word in the statute in connection with an election but the election, of course, is machinery -- the election is machinery set out in detail in the election law of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.839" offset="11670758">In the federal statute, instead of “in connection with,” they used the words “relating to or concerning” which is about the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.019" offset="11707434">The claim by the amicus that the -- that this phrase is vague is untenable and, finally, the amicus only, not the appellant, says that the words in quantity suggest vagueness but the word “in quantity” as construed in the very case in the Criminal Court means a substantial amount, that means not one or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.000" offset="11847346">It means a substantial amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.957" offset="11855182">At any rate, the appellant never tented that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.769" offset="11870438">Now, Judge Roselyn, in his dissenting opinion which you will find very confusing, I believe, because he had to extract portions of that opinion which were contrary to the record before him but, in that opinion, he claims that the statute may be overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.534" offset="11989556">Overbroad in which way?</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.418" offset="11997080">Overbroad for the reason that it should be limited to malicious false statements but we don't claim that that's the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.986" offset="12047339">We say it -- if it's to be construed that way, it should be construed by the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.047" offset="12075551">We claim that the statute, as it reads, which requires identification of person circulating literature as if they're committees, any person who circulates literature in connection with the campaign thereby denominates himself a committee, whether it's one or more than one, and is subject to the provisions of the state election law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4047.871" offset="16294849">As to it being a case in controversy, that issue was tended and decided by the District Court and the Court clearly held that there was a case in controversy involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.638" offset="16333928">The case is very similar to the Evans against Wyeth case that this Court decided some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.179" offset="16356080">If you recall, that was the case where some Negro boy down south tried to sit in the part of a bus reserved for White people and who was threatened with arrest, and he got off the bus rather than being arrested but he entered suit in the District Court for an injunction and declaration of the invalidity of the ordinance that required him to sit in that part of the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.180" offset="16456077">And, this Court sent the case back and held that there was a controversy that should be decided.</text>
