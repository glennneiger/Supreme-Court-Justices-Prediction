            <label>Mr. David Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="16.972" offset="171238">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.675" offset="186075">This is an appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit affirming the order of the District Court of Pennsylvania dismissing the appellant?s complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.828" offset="250650">The appellant was the plaintiff in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.720" offset="262248">He was a resident of the State of New York and a shareholder in the defendant corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.956" offset="303208">He filed a complaint seeking to have the court grant an order permitting him to examine the books of the defendant corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.330" offset="352737">This is a right given by the statutes of Pennsylvania under which the defendant corporation was incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.378" offset="404877">The defendant filed an answer or the merits denying the good faith of the plaintiff, the appellant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.498" offset="441344">Also, denying that the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.358" offset="468825">Subsequently, just before the case came to trial about three years later, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, in which it said that the District Court had no power to grant the type of order prayed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.944" offset="559104">That is an order in the nature of a mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.815" offset="578644">The District Court agreed with the contention of the defendant, dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.208" offset="604244">We appealed to the circuit court which also agreed with the contention of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.127" offset="639875">Judge Smith wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.911" offset="646980">It was concurred in by Judge Freedman and Judge Ganey wrote a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.654" offset="681984">This appeal then followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.932" offset="703091">Under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, a stockholder is given the right to examine the books of the corporation at reasonable times and for reasonable purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.806" offset="766621">The statutes of the State of Pennsylvania then go on to say that this right to examine the books may be enforced by what is called a writ of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.848" offset="826807">Though I surmise that if the statutes had not said so, that the courts in the State of Pennsylvania would probably have found some other method of enforcing this writ either by way of an equity proceeding or by conforming some common law writ of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.579" offset="913638">Now, the courts further have held, that is the courts of the State of Pennsylvania, that the courts of equity in that state can not enforce this right because there is a remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.266" offset="996394">But the courts inequity will enforce the right if some other relief is called for or is asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.579" offset="1025651">This case we asked for no other relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.527" offset="1037458">We asked merely to examine the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.008" offset="1055431">The District Court and circuit court said, Well the State of Pennsylvania calls this a writ of mandamus, you are asking for an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus, we have no right to grant this.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.634" offset="1121886">And this position arises in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.171" offset="1140067">The District Courts being courts of inferior jurisdiction, of course had only the power granted, or rather the jurisdiction granted to them by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.854" offset="1202761">Now, Congress in the original -- under the original judiciary acts and subsequently, has granted the District Court?s jurisdiction in civil matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.707" offset="1266186">In the first cases which arose on this subject, case of McIntire-Wood -- of the McIntire and Wood McClung versus Sullivan, decided that the -- under this statute the District Courts had no right to grant a writ of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.303" offset="1356570">In those cases what was prayed for was an order against a land registrar to register a deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.802" offset="1386559">A land registrar was an executive officer of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.810" offset="1406621">The courts or rather the Supreme Court in those cases said, We are given civil? -- or rather ?the District Court is given civil jurisdiction."</text>
            <text syncTime="339.917" offset="1463045">This is a writ against an executive officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.659" offset="1481958">This is not civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.176" offset="1500035">So the point in those early cases was not that the District Courts did not have a right to issue a mandatory order.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.365" offset="1548831">The point was that the District Courts did not have a right to issue an order against an executive officer of the federal government, because it was considered that this was in the nature of the old prerogative writ of mandamus and was not the jurisdiction which Congress wished to confer upon the District Courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.910" offset="1667009">Now, these cases were followed by cases which dealt with the enforcement of the payments of debts by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.903" offset="1723016">A case such as Rosenbaum and Bauer I mentioned in my brief dealt with the question of forcing the state officer to pay bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.127" offset="1767842">And the usual manner in which the state and municipal debts are collected is by a writ of mandamus in the states against those particular officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.750" offset="1818415">And the courts have held that in diversity cases, the federal courts have no right to issue this type of order against the state officers again on the ground that this is in the nature of the old prerogative writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.481" offset="1913292">This concerns the interference of the judiciary with the executive branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.544" offset="1933563">It concerns the problem of the federal government versus the state government, and for these reasons, it was felt that the Congress never intended the District Courts to have power to interfere in these very delicate matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.652" offset="2009945">The next case decided on this subject by the Supreme Court was the Knapp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.558" offset="2033560">The Knapp case dealt with the construction of certain features the Interstate Commerce Act and the question on that case was whether a writ of mandamus could be granted requiring the railroad to publish a tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.654" offset="2121958">The court in that case said that, We weren't given this right that is the District Court is not given this right by the Act and besides there are equitable revenues under the Act by which the saying resell could be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.782" offset="2186533">I?m not quite certain why that was so important in those days, why it was so important for the federal court to say that we can do this by way of equity and we cannot do it by way of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.360" offset="2260825">And I suppose it is because they thought in terms of causes of action rather than in terms of rights and remedies as we do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.887" offset="2310875">Nevertheless, that case, I think, is one which does not deal with ordinary civil litigation and does not come within the meaning of the word civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.210" offset="2396244">These are the cases which the Supreme Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.053" offset="2415574">In the lower courts, there are -- there have recently been, since the 1960s a few cases at which the lower courts have said, We are bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court which stated that we have no power to issue a writ of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.444" offset="2521109">These cases are very often dealt with cases of officials either of the state or of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.957" offset="2559248">And those cases I think also do not come within the terms civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.955" offset="2579205">However, there were a few cases in the lower court where they decided that they didn't have the right to issue a writ of mandamus in a case where an ordinary mandatory order in civil litigation was prayed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.662" offset="2650049">Cases similar to this one, cases in which a stockholder wanted to examine the books of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.291" offset="2688502">It is our position that merely because the State of Pennsylvania enforces this right by what it terms a writ of mandamus, and merely because the same word mandamus is applied to different things that the right of the District Court to issue that type of order is not limited -- that was never intended to be limited by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.126" offset="2831862">If you state the proposition in this way, if you say, Congress never intended the District Courts to have the power to issue a mandatory order in private civil litigation where it is requested by one individual against another, I think the question answers itself, because the mere statement of that question which shows that the courts would be so inhibited in granting relief under modern conditions that is impossible for Congress ever to have desired such an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.221" offset="3028302">It is our position that the District Courts do not have a right generally to issue mandatory orders against public or state officials except as modified by a recent Act in 1962, but that they do have the right to issue orders against individuals to enforce purely private rights and private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.535" offset="3165497">Now, the dissenting judge in the Circuit Court of Appeals approached the problem in a slightly different manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.289" offset="3208547">He said or he inferred that under the present rules, there are no -- there is no differentiation between actions at law in equity, we only have civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.068" offset="3275630">And if a mandatory order is asked for, who is to say whether it's asked for at law or whether it?s asked for in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.173" offset="3308022">The mere fact that the state says that you do it by an action and mandamus at law doesn't bind us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.192" offset="3340100">We have a right under the doctrine of the York case and under the general doctrines of the federal courts to make up our own enforcement laws unless they are specifically prohibited to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.901" offset="3415019">There certainly is nothing in the statutes which inhibits the District Court from making a mandatory order.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.220" offset="3460263">The statutes merely say that the District Courts shall have civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.294" offset="3488580">Everything else with regard to mandatory orders and private litigation is substantive which has been added only by the lower courts under, I believe the mistaken impression that the word mandamus so taints a mandatory order of any kind that the lower courts, District Courts have no right to grant that writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.473" offset="3741236">While it is true that the narrow issue presented in this case is whether a Federal District Court has jurisdiction to issue a mandatory order in the nature of mandamus where that is the only relief requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.356" offset="3816782">There is a much more fundamental issue which is presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.894" offset="3838934">And that is whether an individual state by conferring a certain right and a certain remedy upon a plaintiff which remedy is enforceable in the in the state courts can thereby expand the jurisdiction of the federal court in a diversity case so as to grant the same remedy to that plaintiff in spite of the jurisdictional limitations contained in the Acts of Congress with respect to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.265" offset="3980413">I think it's clear in this case that the relief requested by the plaintiff is in the nature of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.980" offset="4011342">That is, it is a mandatory order directed to a corporation to disclose certain records which the plaintiff wishes to see, and I --</text>

            <text syncTime="988.116" offset="4055855">Well do you suppose the Pennsylvania remedy had been characterized as a mandatory injunction instead of mandamus, would that have made any difference?</text>

            <text syncTime="997.947" offset="4095143">I don't believe so Your Honor, because in the case of Smith against Bourbon County in this Court, it was said that this remedy is a -- the objection to the granting of this remedy is a substantive one and that it cannot be cured by converting the action into an equitable action or by calling it by any other name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.158" offset="4188035">If it is in the nature of a mandamus, that is a mandatory order directed to someone to carry out an act, it is subject to the jurisdictional objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.088" offset="4235682">I think it is important for us in this connection to examine the language of the act which is being considered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.013" offset="4263372">The old Writs Act which is found in Section 1651 of Title 28 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.296" offset="4292524">That language says that, The Supreme Court and all courts established by Acts of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Brown, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1487.415" offset="6053073">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.063" offset="6059656">I'd like to call the Court?s attention to the congressional intent which we believe controls the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.229" offset="6092257">The original judiciary article -- judiciary act in 1789 was limited the jurisdiction of the federal courts severely in the nature of the writs which they could issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.260" offset="6152443">And I think as it's indicated in our brief, Charles Warren in his article in the Harvard law review points out that that was a compromise to get the votes of those in the constitutional convention who were willing to have a federal constitution, but they were not willing to have federal courts with unlimited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.294" offset="6236557">And in the intervening years, since 1789, Congress has enacted a number of Acts in which it has conferred on the federal courts mandamus jurisdiction in certain specified isolated areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.352" offset="6296743">For example, in the Interstate Commerce Act, jurisdiction is given to the federal court to issue a mandamus against a carrier to file tariffs, but it does not give mandamus jurisdiction with respect to Section 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act which compels, or which calls upon carriers to file annual reports with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.790" offset="6390575">Similarly, in 1962, Congress enacted Section 1361 of Title 28 of the United States Code, which is the general jurisdictional section of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.166" offset="6448044">And in that amendment, it was provided the District Court shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof, to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.050" offset="6531532">It was -- it would have been very easy if Congress had wished to confer unlimited jurisdiction upon the federal courts to issue orders in the nature of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.265" offset="6572387">To have simply provided, the District Court shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus period, but Congress did not choose to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.472" offset="6625259">And this omission was not inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.359" offset="6636857">It was clearly intentional, because if the Court please, there were three congressional reports filed prepared and submitted at the time that amendment was being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.165" offset="6692028">Two House Reports and one Senate Report, and in each of those reports in 1962 there appears the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.699" offset="6738213">The single exception to the general proposition that the U.S. District Courts do not have jurisdiction over original actions for mandamus is the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.694" offset="6806131">And not only did that language in each of the congressional reports, but it was incorporated into the congressional record at the request of Senator Mansfield, the majority leader, at the time that that Bill was being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.599" offset="6865795">Now, we submit that with that legislative history of the original limitation upon the power of the federal courts in 1789, the limited expansion of that jurisdiction over the intervening years enacts such as the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.386" offset="6940923">And the conduct of Congress in 1962 in passing this limited amendment to the jurisdictional statute providing for the issuance of writs of mandamus solely as to public officers of the United States, not as to state officers, not as to local officers and not as to corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.360" offset="7028799">If there is to be any change in the jurisdiction of the federal courts in the area of the issuance of writs in the nature of mandamus where that is the only relief sought, this change should come from Congress through a considered study of the situation and consultation with the bench and bar of the legal organizations and full study of the consequences of such a change.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.408" offset="8068995">Judge Ganey's dissent in the Court of Appeals argues that under the doctrine of Erie against Tompkins, a federal court in a diversity case ought to be able to grant the identical relief to a plaintiff which he would have gotten if he had gone into the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.854" offset="8150810">And it appears to be Judge Ganey's contention that Erie against Tompkins deals not only with the rules of law to be applied by the court, but with the remedies which the court is able to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.589" offset="8213713">As I read Erie against Tompkins, it deals with the interpretation of the Rules of Decision Act and holds that in deciding a case on the merits, the federal court sitting in a diversity case should apply not only the statutory law of the state in which it sits but also the common law decided by the courts of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.458" offset="8301171">So that a decision on the merits of that case would not be different for a plaintiff in the federal court that it would have been in the state court because of rules of decision which would applied differently in the state court from the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.745" offset="8366373">And as I read Guarantee Trust Company against York, the so called outcome determinative test which is been widely referred to is really a test as to what rules of decision will be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.447" offset="8421125">And we submit that neither -- that this Court in deciding Erie against Tompkins and Guarantee Trust Company against York did not intend to decide that not only must the rules of decision of the state be applied in determining the answer on the merits, but also that every remedy available in a state court must be available in the federal court in a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.092" offset="8523734">And I submit that this Court didn't intend to say that because of the recognized jurisdictional limitations on certain kinds of cases which the federal courts are not at liberty to consider and decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.186" offset="8576084">I would like to offer to the Court two or three examples in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.622" offset="8597817">Section 1332 of Title 28 provides that the District Court has jurisdiction in a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.028" offset="8635434">It has long been held that civil -- the word civil action does not include ordinary domestic relations cases, support orders, illegitimacy determinations and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.170" offset="8692067">It is also been held that civil action does not include such things as will contests and administration of estates and trusts which are customarily left to the state courts to decide, but if Judge Ganey's theory were carried out, if there were diversity of citizenship and a jurisdictional amount involved, and if the plaintiff could go into the state court and get relief in a domestic relations case or in a will contest the federal court ought to be able to grant him that same relief without regard to any jurisdictional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.539" offset="8825501">Let me offer another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.109" offset="8835845">The Norris-LaGuardia Act imposes a jurisdictional limitation which prevents federal courts from granting injunctions in labor disputes, but there are 14 states which have no little Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
