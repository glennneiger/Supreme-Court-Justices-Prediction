            <label>Mr. Michael H. Rauch</label>
            <text syncTime="81.948" offset="431208">It's our position as I -- and I will get to that shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.342" offset="452733">It's very difficult to separate the nature of Fourth Amendment rights from the nature of Fifth Amendment rights in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.617" offset="485857">Briefly, the facts are and I repeat, they are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.620" offset="497873">The respondent was the vice-president of a Local Teamsters Union in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.727" offset="518248">He was indicted by Nassau County grand jury in 1959, along with two other union officials and 12 other individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.042" offset="555551">They were charged with extortion, coercion, and conspiracy all in violation of the New York penal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.653" offset="585958">The substance of the charge of the indictment was that the defendants were using the Local Union as a tool to establish an illegal monopoly of the jukebox and gaming machine industry in the metropolitan New York City area.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.344" offset="636740">Additionally, that they were -- through the mechanism of the Union, extorting from owners of such machines -- money from owners of such machines by compelling payment of tribute disguised as Union dues, initiation fees, and assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.524" offset="713435">Shortly, prior to the return of this indictment, the Nassau County District Attorney issued a subpoena for the books and records of the Union, calling for these books to be produced at the District Attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.205" offset="772159">This subpoena was served upon -- served at the Union offices in Manhattan.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.818" offset="790653">Their union offices I believe were on 42nd Street in Manhattan.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.093" offset="811760">It's been stipulated or conceded in this case that the union office consisted of one large room in which several of the union officials and employees had desk including the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.366" offset="872887">And the subpoena was served at a time when the respondent was present in these offices, other people were also present.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.863" offset="906846">The respondent refused to comply with the subpoena and upon his refusal the police took the union records over the objection of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.230" offset="968286">There is no claim that any of these records were taken from the respondent's person or from his desk or from any other place which was set aside for his personal use, nor is there any claim that any of his personal property was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.434" offset="1033070">Solely, union records were taken and these included such things as minutes of union meetings, applications of prospective members, union charter, deposit slips.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.872" offset="1094823">And I should say also that many of these are items and this is also conceded here, many of these items were at least in part prepared by the respondent here in his role as an officer of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.017" offset="1147486">And again, most of these items, a large portion of these items were introduced into evidence over objection at the trial -- at the joint trial of the respondent and the 14 other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.043" offset="1207568">The respondent was -- I should add that that trial took several months.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.437" offset="1237138">The respondent was convicted in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.381" offset="1264933">His appeals in the New York State Courts were heard after this Court's decision in Mapp against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.251" offset="1292413">And the New York Court of Appeal -- the New York Courts considered his claims that his Fourth Amendment rights have been violated by the taking of the union records.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.360" offset="1336822">And they held that the search and seizure of the union records did not violate any of the respondent's Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.113" offset="1367855">This Court denied certiorari in 196 -- in October of 1963 and that the respondent began serving his sentence of three to five years, most of which is by now completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.147" offset="1423966">In March of 1966, the respondent applied to the District Court for the Western District of New York for a federal writ of habeas corpus claiming among other things and this is the only claim in this case that his Fourth Amendment rights have been violated by the search and seizure of the union records.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.908" offset="1514977">The District Court agreed with the unanimous conclusion of the New York Courts that no personal rights of the respondent were violated by the search and seizure of the union records and denied the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.786" offset="1562520">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and issued the writ and this Court granted certiorari in January to review, as I said before, the question of whether this particular search and seizure violated the personal Fourth Amendment rights of this defendant -- of this respondent, to be secure in his person, houses, papers and effects which is the language of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.966" offset="1663248">The language which this Court has said many times since the 19th Century in Boyd against United States, that the purpose of this language was to protect the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of his life from unreasonable intrusions by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.031" offset="1831476">What is the New York law in that they are -- if the police were given a subpoena to serve, they go to a place and the person refuses to turnover the books called forth by the subpoena, remember, we're not talking about a search warrant.Have the police got the authority to take the books and bring them in?</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.697" offset="5446196">At the outset, we recognized as the Courts observed in the Katz case that the Fourth Amendment protects people and not places.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.627" offset="5773876">The Jones case, this Court held in substance that defendant who was entitled to use his friend's apartment who had free access to that apartment was entitled to believe that the sanctity of the home and privacies of life extended to this place which was in effect an extension of his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.079" offset="5863737">We submit that there is no basis in this record for concluding that the Union premises were such a private place that in terms of the Fourth Amendment, it was tantamount to an extension of the respondent's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.450" offset="5913161">There was nothing certainly to entitle him to consider the Union premises as a private personal enclave.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.694" offset="5950151">He shared this one large room with other people and it presumably was open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.916" offset="5971048">The use of this office was limited to his function as an officer of the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.592" offset="5993723">And here, I would submit that the same rationale which denies him privileges and personal privileges in the books also denies him personal privileges in the premises themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.202" offset="6040221">He should no more have a personal right in the premises because he has a right as a -- in his capacity as a union official to be there, then he should have a personal right in the books because he has a right in his capacity as a union official to retain custody of the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.558" offset="6113573">I should say that the only really personal activities that the defendant is trying to claim were secluded here or his criminal activities which were used by which he used the Union as a façade for engaging in various criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.696" offset="6222137">And we would submit that there is no more Fourth Amendment right to rely on the privacy or the secrecy of union premises to maintain the secrecy of his criminal activities, any more than that the defendant in the Louis case, decided recently by this Court, was entitled to the shelter of the Fourth Amendment with respect to using his home as a base for criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.241" offset="6276368">I'd like to just deal with one other aspect of Jones which I think respondent laces his heaviest reliance on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.872" offset="6302908">That is the fact that the respondent here was on the premises when the search occurred and Jones says -- this Court said in Jones, that an individual who is legitimately on the premises is entitled to object to a search of those premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.915" offset="6371035">And the Court did in fact say that and this respondent was in fact “legitimately on the premises”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.636" offset="6397889">I nevertheless urge this Court that while that standard, namely the “legitimately on premises” test may be a sufficient standard to test searches of homes or as in the case of Jones, apartments, is a singularly inappropriate guideline for cases involving searches of premises which are open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.032" offset="6479496">And particularly in cases involving searches of commercial premises which are open to the public in which employ many people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.729" offset="6506245">In such cases, unlike cases involving searches of purely private premises, the mere presence, even if legitimate, carries with it no implication of any personal right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.722" offset="6558281">We recognized as we must that business or commercial premises may be entitled to the protection and indeed are entitled to the protection of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.423" offset="6601017">The questioned raised by this case is on who's behalf or such premises constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.103" offset="6627767">It is our position and we urge it upon this Court that the “legitimately on the premises” test dealing with a -- what was in substance a home in the Jones case, simply doesn't answer this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.673" offset="6674056">We must look beyond this whether or not the objecting defendant is legitimately on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.851" offset="6706761">And when we do in this case, we submit there is nothing to justify the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the search of these premises intruded upon the inviolability of the respondent's person or upon the sanctity of his home or upon any place which could reasonably be considered an extension of his person or home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.382" offset="6788890">And we submit that it is this test which must be answered before the Fourth Amendment applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.667" offset="6814072">And when we apply this kind of reasoning, it -- the inclusion of the Second Circuit that the respondent's Fourth Amendment rights were invaded by the search is unsupportable and we urged that it be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.803" offset="6970598">Your Honor, the illegality of the search is not in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.173" offset="6996093">The respondent takes three avenues of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.892" offset="7010931">Number one, Jones versus United States gives respondent standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.399" offset="7032978">Number two, Silverthorne Lumber Company versus the United States also gives standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.446" offset="7061191">And then number three and I think this is important, I think that the whole concept of standing perhaps should be reexamined by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.886" offset="7110928">I do not intend at this time to do so unless the Court wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.784" offset="7134542">But I suggest it for this reason, that in the case of Simmons versus the United States, which was just handed down approximately one month ago in Footnote 12, involving the question of hearing evidence and allowing evidence on standing to go into trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.979" offset="7203297">Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out that the question of standing perhaps was examinable in the light of the fact that Linkletter versus Walker was predicated upon deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.381" offset="7260871">Approximately 10 days ago and after I had submitted my brief to this Court that I saw this case, but I refer the Court to Footnote 25 of my brief which says, “In which I argued before the United States Court of Appeals on a response to a direct question by Judge Kaufman who wrote the opinion, that counsel for the respondent suggest that because the Fourth Amendment is based on deterrence rather than self-incrimination, a complete examination of the "on the premises" test and the standing question is an order”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.407" offset="7413008">This is also predicated upon Linkletter versus Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.280" offset="7428472">And in this same Footnote, I cited the same Footnote -- I cited the same law review article that Mr. Justice Harlan had cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.828" offset="7458670">I don't know how far the Court wants me to get into this because that has not been thoroughly briefed, but I think it has absolute merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.186" offset="7488136">And I say this for this reason, that I have been with this case for approximately two years and I have nothing -- I've had nothing but to occupy my time in the issue standing outside of the private practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.395" offset="7544978">And that it seems to me, there is great grounds to employ standing anymore if we're going to have the deterrence rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.787" offset="7582490">Because if deterrence is the jugular vein of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.788" offset="9922539">I think that the Court of Appeals is saying that DeForte is a respondent -- was the victim of a search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.050" offset="9943542">In other words, when the State of New York went in and seized these books and records, there were many factors that indicated that he -- and not just the Union, was the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.799" offset="9990562">Those factors were this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.653" offset="9997981">Number one, monitors had been placed on the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.399" offset="10012923">Number two, there were wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.172" offset="10024103">Number three, by extinguishing the respondent as well as the other two Union officers, the Union really ceases to exist because you incarcerate these people if you can convict them and the only way that you start up the illegal activities again is to either do one or two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.755" offset="10094425">You bring in new officers, or you get the same officers to comeback and start at the same operation again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.156" offset="10120025">And I think in this light, the Court of Appeals applied the "directed at" test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.983" offset="10135280">In other words, as I read Justice Frankfurter in his decision in Jones, he says that he must be the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.351" offset="10168822">That is against whom the search and seizure is directed in order to qualify as a person aggrieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.893" offset="11586957">But Judge Kaufman of course accepted my argument at the Court of Appeals and I filed a very detailed brief of 45 pages that really went into this quite thoroughly as to with Jones, because Jones at that time, in Silverthorne were like two main attacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.754" offset="11658428">I thought Jones apply because I thought obviously that DeForte was the victim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.783" offset="11766471">Now, in their brief -- in the written opinion, the Court did not deal with my Silverthorne argument because of course they didn't have to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.287" offset="11864482">Secondly, Silverthorne Lumber Company which I've laid out in my brief, I think again is another ground.But third of all, if the Court is interested and I don't -- and I do not urge the Court to do this, and I say that it is not required to, but if the Court is interested in discussing standing, and I only say this in light of the reference that Mr. Justice Harlan made in the Simmons case, because in that Footnote, it says that it is suggested that perhaps we should do -- we should reconsider the standing requirement, and that's why I began my argument on those premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.772" offset="12098435">It's a very short opinion written by Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.146" offset="12107943">And in Silverthorne, basically what happened was that there was an illegal search and seizure of corporate books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.826" offset="12138663">The books and records were copied by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.789" offset="12154546">They were then returned to the company in its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.184" offset="12172100">Thereafter the Government, through a subpoena sought to obtain the originals of the same records for indictment purposes I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.328" offset="12216717">They've refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.275" offset="12220479">I say they, I mean the officers and Mr. Justice Holmes back in 1920 without even mentioning the word standing, said that these books and records could not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.027" offset="12283486">And in discussing the Fifth Amendment which was raised at that time, he stated that the Court -- let's see -- the Court in Silverthorne rejected this contention on page 22 of my brief stating that the rights under the Fourth Amendment are to be protected even though the same rights and the same result might have been achieved in a lawful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.987" offset="12383274">I think what the Court was saying is that you preceded in a lawful way and therefore you cannot derive the reason -- benefits of this unlawful search and seizure and that basically is the holding of Silverthorne.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.277" offset="12436459">While it gave corporations the protection of the Fourth Amendment, it also said that this evidence could not be used against the officers of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.987" offset="12475329">This decision was filed up by the Second Circuit in the case of the In Re Dooley which I say in page 23 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.496" offset="12509393">In In Re Dooley which is really the first case that considered the question of standing of officers, affirmed Silverthorne in its interpretation on the particular facts and implied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.273" offset="12564459">And they said that the illegal search and seizure of corporate books and records of a corporation could not be used against the officers of the same corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.084" offset="12615659">It was as contempt proceeding when the corporation and its officers refused to turnover to -- in obedience to a subpoena, the corporate books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.980" offset="12663306">And as Justice Holmes' opinion indicates the -- that subpoena was in turn grounded upon a secret unlawful search of the corporation's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.340" offset="12720776">Therefore, it was an unlawful subpoena and it didn't have anything to do with the admission of evidence either against the corporation or against the corporate officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.394" offset="12764975">It simply was the reversal of their contempt convictions because they said that they were entitled to resist an unlawful search.</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.510" offset="12873435">And in substance, this is what the Court was saying, no matter how it arose, the point was that there was an illegal search and while it was in response to subpoena, the Court said that you can't use this evidence and therefore we're not going to hold a party in contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.254" offset="12992345">In this particular case, I say that really there is no remedy for the officer of the Union because when the books and records were seized, the authorities have got to use of the books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.856" offset="13054830">There is no way that they could object through the Union at the time because the books and records have been seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.578" offset="13077713">Assuming that the -- assuming whether or not the union had or the officers have or they do not have a Fifth Amendment right, they have -- the officer has a Fourth Amendment right to be protected that in this particular case, he was the victim if the Court is going to still ascribe to the Jones ruling and that as a result -- whether we're talking about the Jones case, whether we're talking about the Silverthorne case, beyond the premises test of Jones, the victimization test of Jones, the respondent is entitled to suppression of these books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.468" offset="13229223">The illegality is admitted and the only question is standing and I urge the Court to affirm the decision of the United States Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.361" offset="13288782">All I would say in rebuttal Your Honors is that the issue which the respondent has attempted to inject indirectly into this case, namely the whole question of standing itself is one that was not briefed below and I can't say whether it was argued below because I didn't argue in the case below myself, but it was not -- neither has it been briefed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.793" offset="13390555">I would not consider it to be a proper subject for this Court's decision but in any event I would repeat what I began by saying in answer to a question of Mr. Justice Fortas, namely that standing is an often misused word which I take to be a shorthand description of whether or not the objecting individual's Fourth Amendment rights were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.607" offset="13489821">So, it seems to me they talk in terms of eliminating any standing requirement would be to rewrite the Fourth Amendment and I would consider that that's not something were interested in doing.</text>
