            <text syncTime="24.972" offset="203212">This matter is before the Court today on oral argument arising out of a conviction in a state court of petitioners Lee, Brashin and merit in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.532" offset="253471">The defendants were brought on for trial before the trial court on various counts of violation of the Florida Lottery laws and dissemination of raising information by telephonic methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.599" offset="321808">The trial resulted in a verdict of guilty as to three of the defendants petitioners here and during the course of the trial, take recordings or wire recordings of conversations had between the petitioners Lee, Brashin and Marrette and others were introduced at the trial over objection of the counsel for the defendants below.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.404" offset="432985">Now, the procedure used and I might address and say in this instant, Florida does not have a permissive wire tap law or a law similar to the one apparently just struck down by this Court in the Berger case that New York has.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.399" offset="520965">The method adopted in this case were that police officers and deputy's sheriff of Orange County arranged with the Winter Park Telephone Company to install a line, a telephone line in a house next to the petitioner Lee's house and advised the telephone company they wanted a party line, that is a line that was on the same cable with the petitioner Lee.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.023" offset="755440">There is evidence that there were some conspiracies so to speak between the deputy sheriff who ordered the line in the one part telephone company to arrange a party line for Mr. Lee so that they could then intercept telephonic communications on that line and record them.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="259.993" offset="1143306">We should differ with the Florida Court on this?</text>
            <text syncTime="261.732" offset="1150307">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.002" offset="1151352">I don't think if this finding is really relevant to the issue if the Court wants to file or believe with the historical fact that the Florida properly stated the question and I would certainly be happy to go along because I believe the very ruling of the Florida Court is limited to the statement that Your Honor had just made or the finding of the Florida Court that there was knowledge on the part of Mr. Lee that he was getting a private -- a party line instead of a private line.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.035" offset="1283532">The first and most obvious fact is that at no time did the police or the deputy sheriff seek a search warrant to obtain the information which they subsequently obtained by the use of this equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.388" offset="1364929">Now, to go in a little bit more into the history of what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.730" offset="1378304">Once the defendant Lee obtained this party line, the police arranged with the Winter Park Telephone Company to install a party -- another party line in a house which were rendered -- which was rendered by the police and an electronic actuator and some other sophisticated type of electronic surveillance equipment was attached to a wall outlet in the house which permitted the police to overhear by headsets and to record by equipment, recording equipment all the conversations that were either placed from an outgoing call or were received by incoming calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.331" offset="1552697">There is no evidence in the record nor has the state contend in its brief and our position to this petition that the police had probable cause to conduct a general search which I believe the State of Florida will have to concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.971" offset="1611212">They did in this fact, a mere search for evidence which of course has been condemned by this Court many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.131" offset="1639946">There was no effort whatsoever to obtain a search warrant to conduct the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.587" offset="1661680">The police merely arranged to have a party line installed in Mr. Lee's house and for the telephone company to install a line whereby they could intercept and record the messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.592" offset="1729703">I believe that the distinction is there is one amounts to no difference for this reason Mr. Justice White in answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.986" offset="1771290">Admittedly Mr. Lee, according to the findings of the appellate court of Florida had knowledge that there was a party line in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.729" offset="1822281">This creates then a double standard if Mr. Marette who called in from his private line and if Mr. Brashin who called in on their private line are protected either under the Fourth Amendment or by Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act then it would resolve itself to an economic problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.776" offset="1930428">That is a person who can afford a private line carries the immunities of a private line without the burdens of perhaps being eavesdropped upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.896" offset="1995003">Now, like this Court has and of course counsel is certainly aware of Schwartz versus Texas a case some years ago where in this Court held that Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act does not apply in state court and we're cognizant of this case and I'm satisfied the counsel for the respondent will argue this case very strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.935" offset="2103150">But I have noted in the recent case of Pugach versus Dollinger where justices of this Court including the Chief Justice have stated that the rationale or the underpinnings of Schwartz had been swept away by the case of Benanti versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.223" offset="2224253">Now, in the Pugach case, although there was an affirmance of the lower court, the issue was not directly connected with the question of the applicability of the rule of exclusion under 605 in this federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.891" offset="6442924">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.791" offset="6466539">The controlling question as I understand it to be in this case is whether a person who is operating an illegal gambling operation over a party line telephone has a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.197" offset="6616168">Before addressing myself to that question, I would like to comment very briefly on the remarks made by my colleague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.466" offset="6665279">First, to answer a question put by one of the justices, petitioner Lee did in fact know that he was on a party line and he had been told by the man who installed the party line telephone and that is in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.662" offset="6786069">Next, one of the members of this Court inquired as to whether or not the Court below did find that the petitioner had been told that he was on a party line telephone and that court did sole said out in its opinion and that is in the appendix also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.428" offset="6917099">Now, we contend that there was no wire tapped in this case within the meaning of the Federal Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.321" offset="6972688">All the police officers it did was to have a telephone installed in a house on a party line and in order not to have to pick up the handle of it every time the telephone rang in there, they put an automatic actuator attached to their own party line so that when the telephone rang in the petitioner's house they could hear it without having to go through the manual operation of picking up the telephone handle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.210" offset="13416260">I don't think this is that violent because it would not be necessary to make Katz retroactive as to trial to this cause and the grounds on which we are relying are preceded -- the trial preceded Katz, the grounds on which we were relying are similar to those raised in Katz and would be merely reaffirming Katz if this Court applied the rationale of Katz and not making it prospective in application as opposed to retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.227" offset="13540289">The point that the general here has completely overlooked is that there are three appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.184" offset="13584071">The record indicates that Brashin and Marette had party -- had private lines and there was no evidence that they knew Mr. Lee was on a party line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.182" offset="13628061">So certainly, when they picked up the phone and dialed Mr. Lee, whatever their motive was, they did not exposed themselves to any recordation, interception or interference and the evidence in the case that convicted Brashin and Marette was nothing more than the recorded conversations and I think this answered Mr. Justice Fortas' question that the incoming callers certainly should be given the protection and I think in this case the outgoing caller should be afforded to protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.742" offset="13778317">Since he has granted the privileges of the line and the immunities, he certainly should not have carried the burdens of having a party line.</text>
