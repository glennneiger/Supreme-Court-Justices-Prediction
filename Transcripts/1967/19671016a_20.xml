            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="27.280" offset="212511">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.893" offset="230902">The question in this case is whether a majority of a quorum of the Federal Trade Commission may issue a valid cease-and-desist order under Section 1 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.039" offset="287535">The Commission is composed of five commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.617" offset="301850">Since its inception, its rules have provided that a majority of the commission that is three commissioners constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.930" offset="343124">A three-judge Division of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a three-member quorum could not act when divided two-to-one.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.435" offset="381158">The Court of Appeals itself was divided two-to-one and the Commission petitioned for rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.688" offset="406131">The Court of Appeals adhered to its ruling that a single dissent would bar valid action.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.055" offset="435597">It divided itself on this issue five-to-four.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.874" offset="458898">The Commission is here on a writ of certiorari because it believes that the ruling below will severely impair its ability to function when only three of its five members are available to participate in a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.978" offset="539251">Now, an order issued by divided two-to-one quorum of the Commission is an order issued by a minority of the total number of commissioners authorized by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.253" offset="588361">The Court of Appeals taking note of this concluded that this is not what Congress had intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.630" offset="613857">It relied on two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.083" offset="623679">First, the statute makes no express provision for action by a three member quorum and second, the Commission must have a politically balanced makeup, at least the statute says that not more than three of the five commissioners shall be members of the same political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.905" offset="711032">So in effect, the Court of Appeals held that the Commission could act by a three-member quorum, but the three member quorum would have to be unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.137" offset="775920">A dissent by the three member quorum would constitute a veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.006" offset="803401">The Commission proceeding involved charges that the respondent Flotill Products, a West Coast canner and food processor made payments in lieu of brokerage, illegal under Section 2(c) and payments of promotional allowances illegal under Section 2(d) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.145" offset="867976">There were cross appeals from a hearing examiner?s decision by the respondent and by the Commission?s Complaint Counsel and these cross appeals were argued to a full five member panel of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.637" offset="917922">But while the case was under submission, two of the commissioners resigned, leaving only three commissioners who had heard the oral argument sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.242" offset="952299">A fourth commissioner was appointed prior to the decision by the Commission, but he declined to participate on the ground that he had not heard oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.313" offset="992632">The three remaining commissioners were Chairman Dickson, Commissioner McIntyre, and Commissioner Elmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.202" offset="1016142">They agreed with Commissioner Elmon concurring in the result that the charges of illegal promotional allowances had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.550" offset="1045608">Now the Court of Appeals affirmed and enforced this part of the order, so that aspect of the case if out.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.843" offset="1066715">When it did that, it also of course recognized that the Commission may act by a valid three-member quorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.262" offset="1100466">Now the commissioners disagreed as to the illegal brokerage charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.197" offset="1116139">There were three elements in this charge of illegal brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.726" offset="1130245">As to one of them, all three commissioners were agreed that the charge should be dismissed and they dismissed that aspect of the charge on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.096" offset="1167757">As to a second, Commissioner Dickson and Commissioner Elmon were agreed that they should be dismissed, but Commissioner McIntyre dissented, so those aspects of the charges were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.164" offset="1216031">Now, the third aspect of these brokerage charges involved the respondent Flotill and they concerned some charges, some illegal brokerage it was alleged, paid to the Nash-Finch Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.297" offset="1280606">Commissioners Dickson and McIntyre agreed that the Nash-Finch charges had been sustained, and Commissioner Elmon dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.753" offset="1318431">So what we had was a situation in which one of the illegal brokerage charges was unanimously dismissed by the three member panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.485" offset="1345285">One was dismissed two-to-one and the Nash-Finch charges were sustained two-to-one.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.859" offset="1374856">The Court of Appeals set aside the portion of the order relating to the payments in lieu of brokerage to Nash-Finch and that is the issue that's before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.719" offset="1418219">And the practical question is what the Commission is to do when there are only three commissioners who can participate in a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.443" offset="1457194">The Court of Appeals and the respondent here concede that the Commission may consider a case when only three members participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.032" offset="1495542">Indeed the respondent at page 18 of its brief says that the problem that we have here does not arise from the Commission's three commissioner quorum or which it had since 1916, rather what respondent objects to is to the corollary to that rule and the corollary is of course that when a deliberative body is permitted to act by a quorum consisting of less than its total membership, the decision of a majority of that quorum is dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.921" offset="1619048">As applied to administrative agencies, we think that this rule has been expressed in holding or dictum many times.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="385.619" stopTime="386.263">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="385.619" offset="1645798">As what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_e_shapiro" startTime="386.263" stopTime="462.871">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="386.263" offset="1648410">As applied to administrative agencies Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.091" offset="1659695">We think the general rule that majority of a quorum may take valid dispositive action has been sustained either in holding or recognized in dictum many times by the lower courts and this appears to be the only decision to the contrary by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.944" offset="1743182">Now, I want to make clear that the quorum rule and its corollary that a majority of a quorum control is regarded by the Commission as a rule of necessarily not a rule of preferred practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.139" offset="1795950">There are situations in which five commissioners are not available to participate in a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.314" offset="1824580">They can cease to occur on the Commission as they did here, a commissioner may be ill; a commissioner may be disqualified as this happened in a number of recent cases and when that happens, then a quorum which consists of a bare majority may be all that is available to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.691" offset="1910157">Well, that is the justification really for the rule which the Commission has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.511" offset="1941400">Now ?</text>

            <text syncTime="470.608" offset="1985808">The commission always sits with five members if they are available except when it uses its powers under reorganization plan number 4 of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.284" offset="2044531">It has delegated some of its powers to a single commissioner to dispose of motions and requests and interlocutory appeals from hearing examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.487" offset="2089357">The single commissioner's action however is reviewable by the full Commission on a vote by a minority of the Commission to take up the single commissioner's action.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.215" offset="2144214">I see that the reorganization plan also provides more delegating through a division.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.702" offset="2166157">Is this comparable to the authority, say in the ICC by statute to delegate through a camera?</text>

            <text syncTime="530.320" offset="2224671">No but it certainly seems that this plan would contemplate forbidding the Commission to delegate to a panel but in that event I suppose the panel would be at least three, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="584.915" offset="2443055">It's conceivable as they have, they might want to grant fuller power to a single commissioner, but of course all these would be subjected to the powers under the reorganization plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.198" offset="2552142">Here I take it that there is no suggestion that this was a deliberate voluntary decision of the Commission, but rather that this panel which is consisted of the only qualified members of the Commission at the time the hearing was held?</text>

            <text syncTime="769.765" offset="3182425">In most instances, Congress has expressly provided by statute that a majority of the deliberative body constitutes a quorum and the corollary to the rule follows automatically that a majority of a quorum can take dispositive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.452" offset="3257135">Now, when Congress has intended to depart from the ordinary rule, it has done so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.489" offset="3281377">It made expressed provision in the Court of Claims for example, when that was a five member court that three members of that court would have to concur in a decision for a valid decision to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.044" offset="3331532">It made a similar provision in 1909 for the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, both of these are courts where statutes adopted prior to the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1940 and a similar provision now appears for one administrative agency only, the Federal Maritime Commission, which also must as a result of a 1961 reorganization plan, make its decisions with the concurrence of three members.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.811" offset="3986578">Is there any other federal agency that under statute like the Federal Trade Commission acts as you suggest, they should be entitled to act in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="984.147" offset="4039973">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.423" offset="4045093">The Securities and Exchange Commission, like the Federal Trade Commission does not have any statute and express provision stating that a majority shall constitute a quorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.982" offset="4091277">Nevertheless, the Commission since its beginning days, some two years after it was organized has held that it can act by a quorum consisting of majority of its five member membership and that a majority of the quorum it can take dispositive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.255" offset="4160345">Now the SEC statute actually is a good illustration of Congress' recognition of the propriety of this course of conduct the FTC has followed since it was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.415" offset="4205066">The original Securities Exchange Act of 1933 was to have been administered by the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.185" offset="4232129">And in 1934, Congress set up an independent agency and transferred those functions to the new Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.215" offset="4268283">Well, that provided in the statute that the new Commission was to begin its functions as soon as a majority of the commissioners were qualified, So that it apparently contemplated that as soon as there were three commissioners on the five member SEC, they could take action by majority of a quorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.274" offset="4364518">Now, the Court of Appeals suggested that one of the justifications for its rule was that the Commission is a politically balanced agency that is that not more than three members of the Commission may be of the same political party, but this is true for all of the great regulatory agencies and they all have the same general approach to this question of quorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.443" offset="4457096">They have a provision that permits them to act by a majority of quorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.147" offset="4479979">I think a second answer to what the Court of Appeals suggested is that the regulatory commissions are not supposed to be voting according to partisan viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.795" offset="4514565">They perform quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.400" offset="4528985">And as the Court, this Court said in Humphrey's Executor, the Commission is to be non-partisan and the members of the Commission and the very nature of their duties have to act with impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.710" offset="4578200">For this reason, I think that the Court of Appeals emphasis on the political makeup of the commission is somewhat --</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.248" offset="4648312">And I think that points up the exact situation, certainly the issues that come before the Federal Trade Commission, don't follow partisan line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.882" offset="4686869">Even if some tiny weight were given to this political balance element, I suggest the unanimity rule is more disruptive than the two-to-one rule, because with the unanimity rule, the Court of Appeals adopted thus as to give to the dissenting member a veto over valid action by the Commission, which he wouldn't have in the full Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.626" offset="4773909">If two members of the Commission dissent, the decision goes into effect nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.891" offset="4798986">Here is a situation where one member dissents, no action can be taken at all and then there is some practical considerations that come with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.699" offset="4834200">The Commission can't know in advance of course when two members are disqualified and three members are sitting whether the three will agree, so this would mean that the cases have to be reheard and if a valid or qualified -- another qualified member couldn't be found to break the deadlock there might be no valid action at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.645" offset="4929912">Now, the respondent argues that the case, the Commission should act by an absolute majority for a judicial body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.136" offset="4967946">I think the short answer to that is it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.601" offset="4977768">It is a quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.945" offset="4995114">It does not have the attributes or powers of the Court, it never has had them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.923" offset="5011101">This Court said as much in Federal Trade Commission against the Eastman Kodak many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.657" offset="5042030">There are some other practical considerations that are advanced in support of the rule by the Court of Appeals suggested that two-to-one decisions are inherently unstable, because they may be overruled later by the full Commission or they may be overturned in appeals by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.654" offset="5105977">Well, this objection really goes to an institutional problem that all deliberative bodies are faced with, the close decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.370" offset="5136802">The principles underlying a three-to-two decision may be modified because of a subsequent change in the Commission's membership or because the commissioner has changed his thinking or because he has been persuaded by dissent and as far as the possibility of cases being changed in the Courts of Appeals are concerned any decision that is supported by a well-reasoned dissent invites resort to the courts by the losing party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1285.333" offset="5244740">Well, what it comes down to is that two-to-one decisions are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.121" offset="5255816">There were times when the Commission is not going to be able to act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.851" offset="5274728">If the Commission can act with a two-to-one decision, there may be some disadvantages on occasion because after all we are dealing with the situation in which you are faced with some imperfection in the administrative process, because a full Commission isn't available, but you have to balance the consequences of permitting a veto on the one hand against the effective performance of the Commission's duty on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.239" offset="5372322">Now in the absence of some of congressional expressions to contrary, I think that the general rule that ordinarily applies to deliberative bodies applies to the Federal Trade Commission just as it applies to all the other administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.738" offset="5422373">For these reasons, we think the Court of Appeals has erred that its rule would simply serve either to bar action by the Commission in some cases or to deter the expression of dissenting views and that neither of these possibilities, which server the purposes underlying the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.235" offset="5536266">This case involves a simple question of statutory construction and that is whether the Congress authorized the Federal Trade Commission to decide adjudicatory matters with the concurrence of less than a majority of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.352" offset="5604812">Now while the Court may not -- need not go beyond this question of statutory construction, we urge that there is no basis in the administration of justice for reaching a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.874" offset="5666879">The facts of this case illustrate the need for the rule which we advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.090" offset="5695718">In 1958, a complaint was filed against Flotill, charging them with the violation of the brokerage provision of the Robinson-Patman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.153" offset="5731976">This Section makes it illegal for a seller to grant or a buyer to receive a discount in lieu of brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.015" offset="5767398">Precisely the same standard, precisely the same liability is fixed for the seller and the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.070" offset="5799685">Two issues were raised; one with respect to field brokers and one with respect to advertising or promotional allowances made in 1955 to a single customer, the Nash-Finch Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.701" offset="5858200">When the case came before the Commission for decision, there were three separate opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.293" offset="5880560">No commissioner concurred in the opinion of any other commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.605" offset="5901772">Chairman Dickson and commissioner Elmon dismissed the field broker charge, commissioner McIntyre dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.894" offset="5942941">Chairman Dickson and Commissioner McIntyre held as liable on the Nash-Finch payments, commissioner Elmon dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.136" offset="5975960">Commissioner Riley who was qualified to act in every respect did not participate and may I say Mr. Justice Fortas, it is quite frequent for commissioners who have not heard oral argument to participate in the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.156" offset="6036041">Now subsequently, the very same issue involving the very same transaction came before the Federal Trade Commission in a proceeding against Nash-Finch, who had received this illegal brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.507" offset="6097377">The same witnesses were called in the Nash-Finch case, the same documents were offered in evidence, I might add humbly even the same lawyers represented both the litigants, but in the Nash-Finch case, by a vote of four-to-nothing, the complaint was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.593" offset="6169788">Commissioner McIntyre, who had been the one holding guilty all the time in the Flotill case did not participate and the Commission's action in the Nash-Finch case was foretold by its action in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the Empire Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.154" offset="6247946">The Second Circuit had handed down a decision which basically followed the majority opinion in this case, in a case pending before the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.493" offset="6293295">On rehearing, the Court of Appeals asked the Commission to file an amicus curiae brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.921" offset="6319104">The Commission did so and four commissioners, with Commissioner McIntyre dissenting, adopted in that amicus brief what is substantially the view of Commissioner Elmon in this case and therefore Commissioner Elmon's minority view here became the majority view of the Commission and when Nash-Finch came before it that case was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.289" offset="6420564">Now, I turn to the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.485" offset="6433311">There is no language in the statute, none whatever which justifies a decision by less than a majority of the commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.815" offset="6474585">First, Congress provided for this quasi-judicial body of five members and it said that no two of their term should expire in the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.940" offset="6519097">This was obviously designed to promote continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.741" offset="6534353">Then it said, they could be removed only for cause and in the Humphrey's, this Court held that the President could not remove a commissioner except for a good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.735" offset="6578343">Third, the Congress provided that no more than three of the members of the commission should be of the same political party, obviously to achieve a bi-partisan agency and yet if the Commission's view is sustained here, the President can appoint three members of his own party and let the other two vacancies be unfilled permanently and the three members of his party could constitute the commission and destroy the congressional bi-partisan purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.194" offset="6796100">The Commission today asked you to interpret that language to say that two vacancies shall not impair their ability to act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.066" offset="7887600">Secondly the validity of the quorum rule cannot be confused with the power of the Commission to act by a vote of three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.159" offset="7928038">For example, if the Commission had adopted a quorum rule saying that two commissioners are a quorum, I would be here urging that that rule was invalid or if they had said one commissioner was a quorum, I would urge that rule is invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.163" offset="8664064">Frischer versus Bakelite holds that governmental bodies like City Council, zoning boards, that sort of entity may act by a board of a majority of a quorum, but the judicial bodies, bodies exercising judicial functions require a majority of the whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.023" offset="9247431">And if we had been entitled to review by the full Commission, what the full Commission did in Nash-Finch would certainly indicate that our case would have been dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.168" offset="9828080">From the first two-to-one decision that we are aware of, there have been 30 cases decided by the Commission by vote of three members.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.482" offset="10273311">The final point that I would like to make is that the Commission argues here for administrative practicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.233" offset="10328273">They say they would like to have five commissioners sit, but it is not always feasible and so they ask this Court to substitute convenience for justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.481" offset="10445302">They argue that if only three commissioners hear that argument, they can't know whether they will be unanimous and the argument might turn out to be a waste.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.609" offset="10681762">Mr. Shapiro, before you head into your argument, may I ask you this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.640" offset="10709974">In view of the fact that Congress has passed this Reorganization Act that gives you the right to set up panels, but with the right that reviewed by the entire Commission, why do you not accept that congressional approval of this saying and do it in the way Congress apparently intended to be done rather than the short circuit, they act and do it your way, that denies someone a hearing before the whole Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.987" offset="10847274">Is that a fair question to ask?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_e_shapiro" startTime="2689.303" stopTime="2749.024">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="2689.303" offset="10860544">Well, I think I have been trying to answer it [Laughter] as fairly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.956" offset="10895235">The Reorganization Plan when is intended to give the Commission more flexibility in carrying out its functions, it was not intended to correct any oversight about the nature of quorums in the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.528" offset="10949465">Now the Commission here hasn't purported to act under the Reorganization Plan because it did not have available a full -- well, because it has never felt it necessary for it to sit in panels of two or one or three, simply as a matter of general practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.105" offset="11051760">What it has done is to adopt -- is to adhere to its rule now some 50 years old that when it can't sit except with the fair majority, then it will go on and carry on its business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.024" offset="11099512">I understood Mr. Simon was saying that there had been 27 cases that had gone to judgment where you have had only three to sit?</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.970" offset="11151235">There have been I think 30 cases, where only three have sat because of vacancies on the Commission and disqualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.400" offset="11184985">It was not a choice of the full Commission to sit with only three, it was a necessity that they felt they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.382" offset="11216854">They had to sit with three because they just were not the other members available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.301" offset="11244544">Of the 30 cases, 17 resulted in unanimous decisions by the three members and 13 they were dissents, they were two-to-one decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.578" offset="11285713">The Reorganization Plan does not is not the basis for the Commission's action here and it did not purport to act on Reorganization Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.070" offset="11323643">We refer to it because it does indicate that less than a full Commission can take valid action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.843" offset="11498768">Now, this is rough paraphrase.</text>
