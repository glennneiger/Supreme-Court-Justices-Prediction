            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Number 63, Nelson Sibron, Appellant versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.722" offset="316332">Mr. Finkel you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kalman_finkel" startTime="55.484" stopTime="384.324">
            <label>Mr. Kalman Finkel</label>
            <text syncTime="55.484" offset="327408">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.140" offset="337962">This is case is here on direct appeal from the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.030" offset="353531">It is an appeal from the judgment convicting the appellant of the crime of possession of narcotics as a misdemeanor after a preliminary motion to suppress evidence was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.879" offset="392923">Since the judgment was predicated on a plea of guilty, under New York practice, the only issue litigated on appeal, both at the Intermediate State Appellate Court and to the to New York Court of Appeals was whether the appellant’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated because of the manner in which the evidence against him was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.584" offset="463768">No majority opinion was written in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.106" offset="473799">However, the dissenting opinion and the New York Court of Appeals amendment to its (Inaudible) indicate that in affirming the judgment of conviction, the New York Court of Appeals considered appellant’s contention, that Section 188 of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure was unconstitutional and found “That the statute does not authorize an unreasonable search and seizure” and that in this case there was no denial of the defendant’s, appellant’s constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.919" offset="581110">Briefly Your Honor the pertinent facts adduced at the hearing on the motion to stress were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.814" offset="604724">Patrolman Martin testified that while in uniform, he observed the appellant for a period of eight hours standing on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.676" offset="632101">The officer had no information concerning the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.676" offset="644117">During the prior period of his observation appellant was seen conversing to six -- with six or eight known drug addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.664" offset="680061">The officer explicitly testified that he did not overhear any of the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.961" offset="701273">No money passed during the entire period of any – of these observations, nor did any narcotics passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.239" offset="730425">The officer then observed the appellant enter a restaurant, sit down, order coffee and pie and converse with another three -- three different addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.257" offset="766474">Again the officer did not overhear any of the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.400" offset="779013">The officer entered the restaurant, went over to the appellant and told him to please come outside with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.121" offset="805867">Appellant complied with the officer's request and what transpired then can be best summarized at page 16 of the record and I quote, “I said meaning patrolman Martin, you know what I am after?</text>
            <text syncTime="187.189" offset="854141">Appellant, he, meaning appellant reached into his pocket and he held something into his hand, at the same time I went into his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.650" offset="884025">A metal tin foil wrapper containing narcotics was seized.”</text>
            <text syncTime="199.199" offset="902207">It is noteworthy Your Honor that the officer in his sworn complaint stated that appellant did put his hand in his left jacket pocket and pulled out a tin foiled envelope and did attempt to throw the same to the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.325" offset="962706">The following question was also asked to the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.479" offset="979320">You didn't think, when you reached into his pocket, you didn't think he was reaching for a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.053" offset="997606">Answer “I thought he might have been.” Appellant testified Your Honor that he was talking with these known drug addicts about narcotic people.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.787" offset="1044522">He also testified that when the officer came over to him and asked him to come and he accompanied the officer outside, the officer stated to him you know what I am after, appellant replied no, the officer then searched him.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.439" offset="1099170">At the conclusion of the testimony defense counsel moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that the officer did not have probable cause to believe a crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.737" offset="1132398">Initially the Court was disposed to grant the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.930" offset="1145145">The Court reminded the District Attorney that the officer didn't overhear any of the conversations and the appellant could have been talking about the Cassius Clay fight with these non-drug addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.405" offset="1187046">The officer refused the -- excuse me refused to find that appellant consented to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.049" offset="1209616">The District Attorney didn't pursue any theory of abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.864" offset="1220901">However the District Attorney reminded the Court that appellant at the suppression hearing admitted that he was talking about narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.331" offset="1254755">Defense counsel objected on the ground that this totally irrelevant because the officer explicitly testified that he did not overhear any of the conversations, nonetheless the Court found that the officer's action was predicated on probably cause and denied defendant's motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.071" offset="1325704">At the appellate term level the People abandoned the theory of probable cause and instead argued that the denial of the motion to suppress could be justified under Section 180 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.407" offset="1379098">The appellate term affirmed without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.901" offset="1389025">In the Court of Appeals, the appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutional on it's face, because it authorized a stop and search on a standard of less than probable cause and even assuming that the statute was constitutional and inapplicable to the facts of this case, because in this case the officer didn't have reasonable suspicion to believe a crime was committed more than he had reasonable suspicion to believe that he was in danger of life or limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.322" offset="1494664">The Court of Appeals affirmed, two Justices dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.350" offset="1514830">Your Honor -- Your Honors, I would like to discuss here now exactly the powers that the police have under this statute, the conduct that is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.005" offset="1565403">Judge Keating writing in a majority opinion in People v. Peters stated that under vast analysis it is not the language employed that counts, but it's the conduct that is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.069" offset="1605736">We wholeheartedly agree, we must look to way the Court of Appeals has construed this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.133" offset="4901972">They've gone far beyond that limited pre-statutory holding in Rivera with a limited search to a frisk, a patting of the outer clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.983" offset="4937394">Here they say that they are talking about search and they mean search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.817" offset="4956724">So what emerges Your Honor with respect to the rights of the policeman is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.898" offset="4976995">They have the same powers that they ordinarily would only have under probably cause, the power to cease someone and the power to search for evidence and introduce that evidence whatever they found, whether gun or any other put into criminal prosecution on a standard of less than probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.632" offset="5051914">Now Your honor I'd like to turn to that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.577" offset="5067692">The standard is reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.521" offset="5079500">Reasonable suspicion is used in two separate contexts with the same definition; reasonable suspicion to believe a crime is or will be committed and reasonable suspicion to believe that the officer is in danger of life or limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.216" offset="5138328">The Court of Appeals has defined reasonable suspicion as follows and I quote from the Peter's opinion, “Probably cause requires satisfactory grounds for believing that a crime was committed while reasonable suspicion requires satisfactory grounds for suspecting that a crime was committed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.188" offset="5210216">The difference between these two standards is proportionate to the difference and degree of invasion between an arrest and a detention between a full search and a frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.987" offset="5249400">The court went on to state that the standard incorporates “The experienced police officer intuitive knowledge and appraisal of appearances of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.674" offset="5288166">His evaluation of the various factors involve, ensures a protective as well as definitive standing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.850" offset="5316796">Your Honors, one is immediately struck by two aspects in this quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.232" offset="5330380">Number one, the Court of Appeals in Taggart, a subsequent decision acknowledged that there is no distinction between a full search and a frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.281" offset="5358592">They have acknowledged that this statute gives the right to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.256" offset="5374474">Secondly with rather striking Your honor is the fact that it is the officer's evaluation, his intuitive knowledge that has given primary emphasis, very subjective and I say Your Honors let us turn to the facts of this case and now we can see how subjective the reasonable suspicion standard is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.886" offset="5452946">In this case basically the most that the officer heard was or most of the officer observed was not overheard conversation between appellant, a man whom he had never seen and various drug addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.944" offset="5505191">Yet the court was willing to say that that was reasonable suspicion, the officers there had reasonable suspicion to believe appellant is committing a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.983" offset="5541345">You don't have to prophesize to be able to do that in any case where the officer was so and has a record, where he has information or where he knows he is a drug addict any of these people, if they are sitting in a restaurant of course the officer would have reasonable suspicion to remove those people from the restaurant on to the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.433" offset="5611144">Likewise Your honor in Rivera great reliance is placed on high crime rate and the lateness of the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.468" offset="5639252">In that case Your honor anyone walking down the street late at night is possibly reasonably suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.449" offset="5667255">Now the district attorney says, agreed that in this particular case the officer did not have reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.981" offset="5693377">However, he does say one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.876" offset="5700901">He says the Court of Appeals in Taggart had second thoughts about this case and it had this case come to the court subsequent to Taggart, the Court of Appeals might have reversed this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.014" offset="5749488">Your Honor, with all due difference to Mr. Siegel this procedure he has completely misread the Court of Appeals decision in the Taggart case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.189" offset="5790135">Number one in Taggart, the Court of Appeals mentioned that Sibron was a case involving reasonable suspicion and adopted the reasoning of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.568" offset="5835692">The district attorney on page 46 of his brief relies on this Court from the Court's opinion in Taggart to sustain his proposition, “Needless to add the serious problem is suggested only in cases involving serious personal injury or grave irreparable property damage and not by the problems associated with the enforcement of certiorari laws such as narcotics violation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.115" offset="5925867">However, the District Attorney forgot to read the previous paragraph which states, “There are exigencies affecting life, limb, or great property damage in which the police receive information of crime and not sufficient to establish probable cause, but on which they must act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.103" offset="5981874">But the Court of Appeals meant in Taggart Your Honor quite simply is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.431" offset="5995144">Where the police receive an anonymous phone call that a man is engaged in violating the narcotics law, they can go over to him and immediately grab him by the arm and search him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.461" offset="6031297">However where they receive a anonymous information that a man has a gun in his pocket, they can't do that, but nowhere did the Court of Appeals in Taggart intimate that what the officer observed in this case the non-overheard conversation between Sibron and these known drug addicts was something less that probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.783" offset="6116561">Your Honors, I am going to conclude my part of the argument with, I think I've attempted to show where this statue is vulnerable to constitutional attack on many grounds and I am leaving Your Honor for Mrs. Oberman will discuss what I consider the great vice of this statue and that is with the second context of reasonable suspicion, reasonable suspicion to believe that the officer is in danger of life or limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.752" offset="6220424">There Your Honor, I just want to briefly state that we maintain that there was a -- it is a total judicial adjudication to the judgment of the police, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.466" offset="7135336">– very little to say here Your Honor if nothing else, I would rest on the fact that this case has been called a run-of-the-mill case and for that reason perhaps it would be better to hear argument in terms of a run-of-the-mill case, because I really do believe that this is the sort of case, the statute is aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.656" offset="7264068">Now in speaking about the statute I would like to highlight very briefly some of the major difficulties that we have found with Section 188.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.687" offset="7340136">First of all there is a variance between the face the statute, the words of the Court decisions and the facts of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.530" offset="7387575">So that in order to determine what the statute permits the police to do, you have to look at it simultaneously on three levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.905" offset="7429057">What does a statute say, what does the Court say and what does the conduct and those three levels never come together unless you are willing to take a step through the looking glass into that lonely never, never land where as humpty dumpty said, when I use the word it means what I choose it to mean no more no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.267" offset="7530517">I think that this is very apparent when you look at the statute and see the variance between stop, explanation of actions the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.252" offset="7586419">The Court of Appeals has said this is the limited intrusion of asking one for an explanation to his actions and then what the policeman have done in making this stop limited intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.223" offset="7650262">In Peters, the companion case to this one the policeman to make this limited intrusion took the defendant by the shirt collar and pointed a gun against his stomach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.264" offset="7706478">That was the limited intrusion of asking one for an explanation of his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.333" offset="7734794">This statute creates virtually a never, never land where if you look at it just on the level of what it purports to be without looking how it operates in the world, you can't, you can't get any meaning from it and perhaps this is why in terms of the statute like this you can't look at the face merely without looking into decisions and why you couldn't look at the face of the statute without looking at Sibron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.119" offset="7881916">The second problem as Mr. Finkel has pointed out is what does the standard mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.017" offset="7917443">When does the statute permit the police to exercise the powers that it gives them and I think that we have shown you in our brief that the statute curtails the policeman's power or the standard curtails the policeman's power only when the citizen's conduct is perfectly normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.469" offset="8011274">It sets up a range that can trigger police conduct or a range of citizen action that can trigger police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.968" offset="8065296">Anything less than certainty, until perfectly normal because when you look at the, when you focus upon the intuition of the experienced police officer and upon his appraisal of the appearances of criminality then anything that's not perfectly normal is reasonably suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.821" offset="8168741">The third major difficulty with the statute is that it's a break with precedent and I think that this is acknowledged because police powers in the area of criminal law enforcement have traditionally -- of this sort have traditionally been only granted upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.279" offset="8250556">Now the departure from --</text>

            <text syncTime="2678.209" offset="10818288">It was tantamount to an arrest and then, even the justification that's advanced is no longer support for the such part of the statute, because before Taggart at any rate, the depiction was relied upon in the language of the cases that this statute authorized something less than a search even though on it's face it said search, it authorized a frisk, a lesser indignity than a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.641" offset="10956006">But in Taggart, the officer conducted a search and to find authority for sustaining that activity, the Court of Appeals went back to all its prior cases and said in all of those cases, expect People against Rivera, what the officer did was to engage in the search, and therefore we said before that the officer -- if we sanctioned those searches before, we can sanction those searches now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.428" offset="11083170">So that this lesser than rationale just doesn't hold water analytically, because the powers that the statute gives are not lesser than the traditional powers, they are the same powers and when you give the same powers, you can't give them on a lesser standard.</text>
