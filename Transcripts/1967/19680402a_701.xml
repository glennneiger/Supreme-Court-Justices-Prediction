            <label>Mr. Jack Supman</label>
            <text syncTime="37.019" offset="251486">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.993" offset="271339">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Juvenile Court of Fairfield County, Ohio, finding the petitioner to be a delinquent child.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.657" offset="334033">I will describe pertinent facts and my co-counsel, Mr. Rezneck, will present the legal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.531" offset="365484">Petitioner, Buddy Lynn Whittington, was charged with juvenile delinquency on the basis of a single act, the murder of a neighbor and family friend, 63-year-old Mrs. Gladys Willard on July 29, 1966 in the small village in Baltimore, Ohio in violation of the Second Degree Murder Statute of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.530" offset="489514">He was one week past his 14th birthday when the case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.589" offset="517726">This boy has consistently denied this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.950" offset="539146">He had never been in trouble with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.008" offset="555447">The District Court of Appeals found that there was an abundance of evidence as to Buddy Lynn Whittington's good character and reputation prior to July 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.090" offset="603721">He was regular in attendance at school, church, Sunday school, and youth groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.104" offset="631829">He had been obedient at home and at school, and subjected himself to the reasonable control of both his parents and teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.979" offset="675297">Mrs. Willard was reported missing on July 29th.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.959" offset="691179">Many persons in the village, including the petitioner, engaged in a search for her lasting many hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.839" offset="726706">Her body was discovered that evening by the petitioner and his father under the bed in petitioner's bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.218" offset="764217">He was interrogated that night by the principal of law enforcement officials of the village and county, including the juvenile probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.910" offset="807058">The defendant was interrogated in his home, which was under the exclusive control of the law enforcement officials from approximately 8:20 p.m. at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.082" offset="867662">Although the total duration of the questioning is not established precisely by the record, probation officer Rutherford was specifically called after 10 p.m. to participate in an interrogation of this boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.051" offset="935581">Buddy was given no warning as to his right to remain silent or to have the advice of an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.077" offset="963688">While denying the crime, certain of his statements under the interrogation were used against him by the state in his trial to try to support his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.511" offset="1013426">He was formally arrested under a Juvenile Court warrant issued on the basis of a complaint charging him with being a delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.380" offset="1052923">The Juvenile Court judge issued this warrant after consulting with the Juvenile Court probation officer about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.439" offset="1089076">The probation officer who is appointed by the Juvenile Court judge and works under the direction of the judge had interrogated the petitioner on the night of the crime, had accused petitioner of committing it, had participated with the prosecuting attorney and the police chief in the decision to bring the charge, executed the arrest warrant, and appeared as a witness against the petitioner at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.548" offset="1217599">There is no doubt from the record that prior to the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrant, probation officer Rutherford consulted ex parte with Judge Hastings about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.927" offset="1275068">On a motion to dismiss because of the fact that the judge had discussed the case with Rutherford, the Court called Rutherford as a witness and Rutherford said he had reported on his investigation to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.564" offset="1337657">The judge himself not only did not explain or testify as to the extent of the consultations but foreclosed further inquiry by us into what Rutherford reported about the case prior to the filing of the complaint and subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.107" offset="1427832">After the arrest, petitioner was put into solitary confinement in a cell in the Fairfield County Jail at adult penal institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.560" offset="1485615">Fairfield County does not have a juvenile detention facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.884" offset="1510902">The small cage-like cell had no light bulb and it merely contained a bed and a toilet.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.758" offset="1542353">Everyone agreed, including the judge that this jail was not a proper place of confinement for a juvenile, but the state took the position that it was the only place they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.306" offset="1592613">Mr. Kistler and I as his attorneys tried on several occasions by several motions to have him released on bond or in his parents' custody, or at least transferred to a detention home in an adjoining county pending the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.315" offset="1832626">Not having received it, the case then was remanded by the State Supreme Court down to the Juvenile Court, and it then did not retain the jurisdiction but bound him over to the grand jury which indicted him for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.424" offset="1905037">This time first degree and the case is being held up subject to further order of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.390" offset="2012975">And of course, Mr. Rezneck will explain why we're asking to have this judgment set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.389" offset="2032933">And if it is, then this other indictment cannot stand because it is an absolute prerequisite in Ohio that for there to be a binding over and an indictment that there must be a valid judgment of delinquency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.513" offset="8693426">Furthermore, you have a difference in the way juvenile and adult Courts operate in the sense that a Juvenile Court, once it adjudicates someone a delinquent, it has a continuing supervisory jurisdiction over a juvenile and can make dispositional orders of a temporary nature and it may modify them from time to time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.452" offset="10153148">But again, we do submit that this particular question is really foreclosed by the decision of the Ohio Court in this very case, holding that this is a final judgment of delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.551" offset="10201527">I don't have very much time left to argue the merits here, but I would like to indicate what our views are on the assumption which we think is undeniable on the record and under the statutory framework here, that this was a trial of delinquency, no different from any other trial on the merits of a charge of delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.360" offset="10264848">And here, we would submit to the Court that first, this was a proceeding in which the charge of delinquency was based solely upon the violation of a state criminal statute and a serious state criminal statute at that of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.192" offset="10316152">This was not a case in the Court below so held in which an adjudication of delinquency could have been upheld on any other ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.146" offset="10347917">And this was a proceeding which as I've already outlined carried various serious consequences for the juvenile, a possibility of seven years incarceration in a state institution, the stigma of being labeled a murderer and a juvenile delinquent, and the possibility of certification as an adult, which in fact came to pass here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.472" offset="10421269">And we would submit that if you look at what happened below that you will see that this was a Court which although it purported to be a Juvenile Court was functioning with all the harshness and all the stringency of a criminal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.041" offset="10467558">That this is a Court for example which has the power to commit juvenile delinquents in certain instances directly to the state reformatory, which is an adult penal institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.775" offset="10502457">And the whole pattern of the proceeding below is like a criminal trial that charge arraignment of plea, and a trial there is absolutely no indication on this record, that the Juvenile Court here was functioning as Juvenile Courts under their theory are intended to function, namely with therapeutic concern for the individual, with a view to his treatability, to his possible rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.564" offset="10585631">In other words, this Court acted upon this boy with all the harshness that a criminal Court would have acted but without some of the most important safeguards that any criminal defendant would have had, and --</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.957" offset="10971199">But the journal entry when it actually came out and that is the judgment, stated that the Court finds him to be a delinquent and the Court of Appeals below reviewed it specifically on that basis that you had a judgment of delinquency and they upheld it on the civil standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.143" offset="11031907">We would point out that if this boy had been one week over 18 instead of one week over 14 at the time when this case arose, he would have had the rights if he had been charged with the same offense, second degree murder, to a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, to an impartial triar of fact, including trial by jury if he desired it to the protections of Miranda versus Arizona, to right to bail in advance of trial, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.282" offset="11140472">But because he was a juvenile and he was charged with what the state chose to label juvenile delinquency in the Juvenile Court, he received none of these protections which have been deemed fundamental for persons accused of criminal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.706" offset="11190209">And we submit that as this Court made very clear in Gault Case, when you have that kind of gap between the procedures, particularly procedures which go to the reliability of the fact finding process, that wide a gap between juvenile and adult proceedings that requires more than mere verbiage to bridge the gap.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.128" offset="12779917">I'm the prosecuting attorney of Fairfield County, Ohio and such represent the county and the state in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.035" offset="12819519">First, I would like to elaborate little on the facts of this case as I believe them to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.833" offset="12870719">It was on the 29th of July of 1966 that Gladys Willard disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.679" offset="12926098">She was, I think, 63 years of age at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.124" offset="12947832">She was last seen at eight o'clock in the morning by the petitioner here, Buddy Lynn Whittington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.287" offset="12988479">And from that time on, we have not been able to find anyone who saw Gladys Willard alive after that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.967" offset="13035290">At approximately sometime between 7:30 and 8:30 of that evening, she was found dead in the Whittington home under the bed of Buddy Lynn Whittington in his room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.480" offset="13121285">And she was under that part of the bed which was nearest a window and away from the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.222" offset="13156289">Now, this was a small room and there was not much space between the head of the bed and the foot of the bed.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Raymond Morehart</label>
            <text syncTime="3326.072" offset="13407692">The cause of death was due to asphyxiation from strangulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.403" offset="13429008">And in addition to that, she suffered, I think, four or five broken ribs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.395" offset="13448965">She had hematoma of the scalp indicating that she had been hit over the head, and the coroner estimated later that she had been dead approximately 12 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.084" offset="13527751">He also said that she had been in this position for a length of time due to the livor mortis of the body that was apparent then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.626" offset="13565889">An autopsy was made of this woman, and they gave us the cause of death as I have previously stated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.078" offset="13611656">In addition to that, the contents of her stomach revealed, according to the pathologist who performed the autopsy that she had died within one and a half to three hours after she had consumed the food that was then in her stomach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.064" offset="13695666">Now prior to this time, we had ascertained the time when she had eaten this food.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.104" offset="13727744">So I mean this was learned later as to what the contents of the stomach disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.873" offset="13750836">We had learned that she had eaten breakfast at a quarter to six and that she had a dry wheat cereal for breakfast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.946" offset="13795140">And that this food was consistent with what the pathologist found to have been nearly digested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.860" offset="13826800">And that it was he said from one and a half to three hours after she had ingested this food -- after she had taken this food which would then place the cause of death or the time of death some place between probably 8:00 or 8:30 or a little after 8:30 within those limits -- this would also be in line with what the coroner found to have been the time of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.060" offset="13955636">Now, when she was -- of course the authorities recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.488" offset="13973295">And the chief of the police of the village of Baltimore which is a small village of approximately 2500 population, and there's only one policeman there and he is called the chief of police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.163" offset="14023973">The sheriff's office was called and I was called as prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.540" offset="14049573">And later then the Juvenile Court officer was called a photographer was called to make pictures which is our usual procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.460" offset="14089174">A number of questions were asked -- I think everybody around there was questioned including the neighbors who were there and there were a lot of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.937" offset="14131075">The folks were probably in a small town something like this happens you have quite a bit of difficulty keeping people out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.798" offset="14162526">The neighbors were questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.294" offset="14172557">Mr. Whittington and his -- not Mr. Whittington, but Mr. Willard and his son who was living with them were questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.681" offset="14202128">Their families which lived next door to them were questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.587" offset="14221772">Mr. and Mrs. Whittington and Whittington boy were questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.727" offset="14238281">This is a question he was referred to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.344" offset="14248730">They were questioned that night concerning what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.783" offset="14266493">No one was accused of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.738" offset="14278301">No one was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.954" offset="14283212">No one was taken into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.384" offset="14300871">And the statement I think is in air when they said that the premises of the Whittington's were under control of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.810" offset="14338591">They were in control again so far as they would not permit anyone else in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.547" offset="14353533">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.211" offset="14360221">But at no time Mr. Whittington was told they had to stay there or that they could not leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.497" offset="14381328">So I don't think there's any question that either any of the Whittington's or Buddy Whittington, the petitioner here, was not in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.283" offset="14408495">He was not taken into custody and he was not taken into custody until almost a week later which would have been the 5th of August when a warrant --</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.022" offset="14563453">My understanding is, this was the first time he'd ever been left alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.518" offset="14573484">And he was left there because he was going to summer school.</text>

            <text syncTime="3629.685" offset="14622072">And the reason he gave for not going to school was that he had contracted a stomach ache of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.895" offset="14646941">And he said that he spent the time in on his bed playing the record player.</text>

            <text syncTime="3723.995" offset="14999385">And Mrs. Goodrich and her husband and this neighbor went out the place to where they were known to have picked blackberries and they searched for Mrs. Willard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3745.817" offset="15086634">And they kept up the search including some people from the Boy Scouts and so forth of the community there who came in to look for her, and they kept up the search until dusk.</text>

            <text syncTime="3760.960" offset="15147238">And it was shortly after this that the Whittingtons' came home I think about 7:30 if my memory serves me correct.</text>
