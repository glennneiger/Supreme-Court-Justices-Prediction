            <text syncTime="70.155" offset="383979">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.347" offset="404773">I represent the petitioner in this case of Bumper versus the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.919" offset="427029">It comes on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.851" offset="450748">It originated there or came there as a direct appeal from a conviction in one of our superior courts of one of our counties in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.603" offset="489827">The petitioner was convicted on October of 1966 on a Capital Bill of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.806" offset="522637">The jury recommended mercy, however, and so he was not given the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.878" offset="542908">He was also convicted in the same proceeding on two indictments of aggravated assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.940" offset="571120">He was sentenced to serve two-year -- two ten-year sentences, plus a life sentence in the State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.296" offset="608528">The questions which are before the Court are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.970" offset="627231">One of the questions is almost identical to the one involved in the Witherspoon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.030" offset="651473">That is namely the constitutionality of the exclusion of jurors who have conscientious scruples against the death penalty, on due process, equal protection and impartial jury grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.768" offset="706435">The second question involves a search and seizure matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.021" offset="735483">The state searched the premises where the defendant live with his grandmother and there seized a riffle, they did so purporting to act under a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.050" offset="779577">At the trial of the petitioner however, the solicitor or prosecuting officer chose to rely solely on what he said was the voluntary consent of the petitioner's grandmother to the seizure of this rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.448" offset="841122">Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed on that ground both of the questions at bar in this Court were presented to the Supreme Court of North Carolina and there's no question about the petitioner's having raised this questions in apt time both at the trial in the appellate levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.569" offset="929625">Now, the matter involving the first question of the conscientious scruples against the death penalty has been of course very thoroughly and ably explored by counsel in the preceding case.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.898" offset="1002977">And I would like to reserve most of my time to argue on the search and seizure question but I have a few matters of impression on the conscientious scruples issue which I would like to discuss with the court if the court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.255" offset="1080404">Now, to begin with, this case differs from the Witherspoon case in that my client, his trial was permitted to ask plenty of questions to the prospective jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.581" offset="1149680">The judge himself asked lots of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.378" offset="1164936">And I think there's only really the case of maybe one or two prospective jurors on the voir dire who were not quite thoroughly gone over on this question of whether they had conscientious scruples against the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.957" offset="1223241">I think quite clearly from the record that the jurors understood what it was and they were asked if they could impose in any case and if they said they could impose it in any case or a proper case, ordinarily the court permitted them to sit on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.685" offset="1278098">So, in the Bumper case, we face the question head on and we present the broader question which the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Crawford v. Brown, the four justices who represented the majority position of the court chose to use in setting aside the conviction of Crawford in that case, namely the --</text>
