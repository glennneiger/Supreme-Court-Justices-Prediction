            <text syncTime="46.492" offset="289311">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.294" offset="304567">This case is hereon a certiorari to the Ninth Circuit to review the judgment of that Court denying enforcement of the Board's order issued against the respondent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.261" offset="368410">The basic question presented is whether an employer interferes with strike activity and discriminates against strikers in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, where he treats returning strikers as having lost their right to be reemployed ahead of new employees simply because on the day that they asked for their jobs back, those jobs are temporarily unavailable due to a reduction in production caused by the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.738" offset="538311">Now, the basic facts are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.217" offset="556283">Respondent company is a manufacturer of mobile homes in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.572" offset="585644">On August 6th of 1964, as a result of a breakdown in collective bargaining negotiations, between the company and the carpenter's union approximately one-half of the company, the 108 employees, went out in support -- went out on strike in support of the Union's demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.074" offset="679685">That was an economic strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.660" offset="694000">Because of this reduction in working force, the company cutback its production schedule which had been about 20 units per week to 10 units per week and curtailed its standing orders for raw materials accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.538" offset="777488">By August 18, the company hired 21 new employees and some of the strikers had returned to work so that its workforce was now 71 as concurred with a prestrike level of about 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.922" offset="847078">On that date, the Union accepted the company's last contract offer, terminated the strike and requested reinstatement of the remaining strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.171" offset="904025">Although the company intended to increase its production and workforce to the prestrike level as soon as possible and I'll come back to that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.483" offset="953344">It explains that the Union, that it could not, right at that moment, handle any of the returning strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.420" offset="993050">The Union requested that the strikers be put on a preferential hiring list.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.291" offset="1016560">The company refused saying that although it would consider them for openings as they occurred, if desired, they'll remain free to hire from the outside market as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.721" offset="1098271">On August 20, two days after the strike ended, six strikers applied for reemployment and on a number of occasions thereafter, they renewed their applications making it quite clear that they were ready and able to return for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.065" offset="1183640">Between October 8 and 16, the company hired six new employees for jobs which the striker applicants were qualified to fill.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.441" offset="1241109">None of these jobs was first offered to the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.878" offset="1262843">The six striker applicants were reemployed between November 2nd and December 14th.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.541" offset="1329507">The Board found that when the six strikers applied for reinstatement at the end of the strike, they had not been permanently replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.585" offset="1369736">No one has been hired to fill their particular jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.336" offset="1392724">The Board further found that the lack of immediate openings at that time was a temporary condition which the company knew would change and intended to change was its purpose later achieved to return to full production and to a full crew as soon as practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.480" offset="1485302">The Board concluded that in these circumstances, the strikers were entitled to be reinstated, a job when it came open and then when the company failed to do that in October and instead hired new employees, the company discriminated against the strikers in violation of Section 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.522" offset="1597419">The Board ordered the company to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices and to reimburse the strikers for any loss of earnings attributable to the failure to hire them in October.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="538.162" offset="2256018">Now, what you had here was nothing like that and it is so substantially different on those two situations and we submit that it does present a very basic legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.522" offset="2325504">I would like to illustrate what I'm talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.751" offset="2362389">Now, this was not under Mackay, there is no question that in an economic strike, the employer would have a right to hire permanent replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.034" offset="2435532">Now this was not -- despite the fact that the respondent here talks of this as though it were a situation of replacement, this is not a Mackay situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.651" offset="2505958">By that, I think it's perfectly clear that respondent did not show in this record that it was his obligation to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.095" offset="2551724">He didn't hire any particular person to replace the new strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.835" offset="2586728">I think that that's quite apparent on the letter which the respondent's counsel wrote to the Union which appears at page 81 of the record where he says, “Since we did not hire nearly as many replacements as the number of persons on strike, it's really impossible to supply a statement indicating which individual strikers the new employees replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.595" offset="2733746">And similarly, the plant manager at page 62 of the record said that as to who replace who, it is difficult to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.771" offset="2774497">But as to what man filled, what man's position on page 63, I can't honestly say these men were hired in preparation for increasing the production and getting it backed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.274" offset="2820472">In other words, the company was in the process of expanding its production back to the pre-war level even -- no, it hired some new employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.710" offset="2866239">It was still well below at least over 30 jobs below of the pre-war compliment which it was intending to get up.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.823" offset="2902706">There was no replacement in -- on Mackay, nor was there any permanent job abolition in the sense that the prior cases have regarded as legally sufficient to be the equivalent of -- to be sufficient could deprive the employees of their employee status.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.573" offset="3009703">Because after all, what we have to set is again is to require of course specific provisions in Section 2 (3) of the Act which says that an employee on strike has not lose his status as an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.024" offset="3075427">You have to have something -- a very substantial before it is going to rise to a stature of being sufficient, could deprive the employee of his employee -- a striker of his status as an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.270" offset="3148466">A permanent replacement is one of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.807" offset="3170617">Yes, permanent job abolition is another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.859" offset="3186813">Now, let us examine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.025" offset="3195486">With respect to that, we have the credited testimony here of the plant manager, Mr. Chapman, on page 51 of the record in which he is asked, “Did you subsequently increased your program production of units?”</text>
            <text syncTime="798.258" offset="3296423">He answered, “Yes, we did, for the purpose of purchasing and getting reorganized, we agree that we would -- say, programs 10 units a week until we found out how things was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.275" offset="3340518">But it was our intention to get back the flow production as soon as possible”.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.675" offset="3366118">And he repeats the same thought on page 17 -- 57 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.434" offset="3385135">You did intend at all times to get production as quick as possible up to 20 trailers a week, correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.260" offset="3420453">So here is a situation where at the time the strikers asked for their jobs back, on August 20, those jobs were not filled by anyone that was hired during the strike as replacement for the strikers nor could it fairly be said that in any realistic sense, those jobs had been abolished.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.834" offset="3806751">And since -- what occured here is likely to be a situation in most strikes to regard this kind of a temporary job unavailability.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.857" offset="3954813">It is a far more devastating than the right of permanent replacement which is recognized in Mackay because after all, permanent replacement depends upon a number of variables.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.976" offset="6647306">Now that is precisely the very question which the Board itself said it was determining, which the Ninth Circuit said it was determining so that they cannot constitute a valid distinction of those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.554" offset="6705612">Well, I think that's just wrong.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugh_j_scallon" startTime="1655.444" stopTime="2243.499">
            <label>Mr. Hugh J. Scallon</label>
            <text syncTime="1655.444" offset="6725151">Now, although not addressed to an oral argument here, the petitioner suggest that a different result might be compelled in this case because of this Court's recent decision in the Great Dane case which holds that given the discriminatory act by an employer, that an intent to discourage membership in a union organization in its broad sense can be inferred in the burden of proof shifts to the employer to justify his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.859" offset="6850853">Now, we submit that Great Dane is not applicable to this case for these three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.093" offset="6883767">First of all, as Mr. Come said this morning, the Labor Board concedes that no preference is required for strikers whose jobs had been abolished, now I submit that it couldn't have been the intent of Great Dane to require an employer to justify an action which the Labor Board concedes as a matter of law it had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.808" offset="6990555">Secondly, and probably recognizing the foregoing, the law of the Labor Board in it's own brief here only applies Great Dane to unreplaced economic strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.607" offset="7049801">That appears in their brief at page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.539" offset="7061504">Now, as I indicated, we stipulated at the hearing orally to -- on the record and we have contended ever since that if the strikers' positions had not been permanently abolished, they were entitled to preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.740" offset="7122317">But if they had been permanently abolished, they were not entitled to preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.783" offset="7138513">But again, this turns on that fact issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.295" offset="7176547">There is even however -- I think a more fundamental reason why Great Dane is not applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.209" offset="7204237">And I think -- and it goes to the whole heart of the Government's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.979" offset="7227329">In Great Dane, the -- an employer on July 12th suddenly announced that back as of July 1, vacation eligibility would be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.933" offset="7271111">The result was that the strikers were not eligible for vacation, nonstrikers were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.990" offset="7299323">At least in the opinion of the majority, this was a clear case of discrimination and the Court to hold it to both of its opinion to the issue of intent and burden of proof in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.815" offset="7358673">Now, the Court pointed out in Great Dane an 8 (a) (3) violation consisted two elements, ithas to have the discriminatory act and there has to have the intent to discourage union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.724" offset="7406320">Here, we do not have the first element of the 8 (a) violation, a discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.532" offset="7437458">As the record shows the -- and the Court of Appeals so found, what we had here was really a permanent cutback of operations and these strikers were unemployed as a result of a permanent cutback.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.605" offset="7473821">And this doesn't constitute a discrimination, and again, I -- I think the best statement of why it doesn't constitute a discrimination appears in the petitioner's brief where they say and I'm quoting, this is at page 15, “Where there's always a risk that changes in economic conditions or inefficiency of production may prompt the elimination of the jobs that some employees hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.918" offset="7623032">And still another argument, what seems to me to be basically inconsistent incidentally with the Board's acceptance of the general principle of permanent abolishment constitutes replacement, the petitioner here suggests that we should be compelled to establish a preferential hire list because the employer might use an economic cutback as a deliberate subterfuge to pun -- to continue to punish strikers after the strike is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.798" offset="7738598">Now, this I submit is just another way of raising a fact issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.584" offset="7753749">It goes to the question whether there was in fact abolishment or whether there is a deliberate withholding of the position from the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.730" offset="7790320">I'd like to point out here, that the hearing examiner found, the Labor Board adopted and the Circuit Court approved the finding that the employer had no conscious intent to discriminate against these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.344" offset="7844760">Its discrimination if any was inadvertent in determining whether there had been a permanent cutback or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.598" offset="7901811">Turning to the amicus brief and so far as it goes beyond the intentions of the Labor Board, is the position of the AFL-CIO that notwithstanding the entire body of law that has developed under the Mackay Radio case back 1938, this Court sua sponte should establish a rule that an employer must create a preferential hire list or striking employees regardless of the business conditions and so on that exist after the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.407" offset="8049037">It is very candid in its brief and is -- and it admits that the contrary rule had been applied and I've quote without exception since the Mackay case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.689" offset="8106088">Now, there are a number of reasons why the Court should not act on the suggestion of the amicus in this brief or in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.855" offset="8138794">I'd say first of all, that this is not the type of case that this Court decides as a matter of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.198" offset="8164185">This is a highly important and highly -- very noble decision that should not be made without the -- without prior consideration of lower levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.304" offset="8200547">As this Court said in the (Inaudible) case, which I quoted in my brief, followed the Board's decision is not the last word, it must assuredly be the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.915" offset="8243075">Second, I believe the contention of the amicus is not sound in law either in the language of the statute or in its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.893" offset="8290931">First, looking specifically at the language of the statute, Section 9 (c) (3) deals with the rights of strikers who have been replaced and speaks specifically in terms of reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.016" offset="8343385">Section 9 (3) -- (c) (3) simply gives them a very limited right, the right to vote and we submit that the limited nature of this grant indicates that the Congress did not have in mind to grant them any additional right beyond this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.574" offset="8421648">Second, if you look at -- or third rather, if you look at the legislative history of the 1947 and 1949 amendments to the Labor Management Relations Act, there are twice specific reference to the Mackay Radio case and is significant, the language that the spokesman at that time used is the position of the amicus that Mackay holds nothing more than that an employer may hire permanent replacements, but did not address itself to the question of what the right of those persons who have been replaced -- what their right will be after the strike is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.037" offset="8579532">But if -- we're referring to page 22 of my brief where the pertinent legislative history is given, it should be noted that the Senate Report Number 1126 says this, “If such strike is an economic one and not caused by an unfair labor practice of the employer, strikers permanently replaced have no right to reinstatement”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.518" offset="8685484">In other words, Congress at this point had recognized the further extension of the Mackay doctrine that it not only give the employer the right to replace but hire replacements, but it also terminated the rights of reinstatement of the replaced employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.682" offset="8754134">Now, that's from the Senate -- that is from the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.438" offset="8765106">As all -- I had -- it's very significant, although it comes from a critique of the bill, Senator Pepper used this virtually identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.611" offset="8805857">Finally, there is a practical reason why the Court should not change this rule at this stage of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.168" offset="8832084">This has been the virtually universal -- or the universal rule for almost 30 years and employers all over the United States have acted in reliance on these rules concerning reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.952" offset="8883179">Now, if this Court were to change that rule today and apply it to my client, essentially on a retroactive basis, the result would be that subject only to the statute of limitations, every employer in this comp -- in this country, who hired as of -- which might call off the seniority list, in other words a new employee would be subject to an unfair labor practice finding and the substantial back pay liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.645" offset="8993938">I've cited in the -- in my brief, the cases in this Court which point out that when there has been a long reliance, unchallenged on an administrative interpretation of an act that this Court will not likely reverse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.507" offset="9065409">I have nothing more unless the Court has some questions, I will --</text>
