            <text syncTime="18.916" offset="179075">Although this case appears on the docket as United States versus Louisiana, it in fact has nothing whatever to do with Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.950" offset="215124">The dispute here is as between the United States and the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.492" offset="237380">The legal principle involve cannot conceivably affect any other state but Texas with the single exception of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.654" offset="269981">It could not and does not as we view it at least affect Louisiana or any other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.425" offset="301119">Nevertheless, perhaps in thought because of the title, perhaps also in part because of the response filed by the State of Texas, Louisiana has expressed its concern that the Court might think otherwise than we do as to the breadth of the ruling in this case, and have asked for an opportunity to briefly state their views.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.548" offset="393592">In a spirit of accommodation, I have agreed to cede few moments of my time to Louisiana so that it may present that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.378" offset="428910">As I understand it, their view simply is that the case has nothing to do with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.229" offset="452315">After I conclude, I will therefore cede to Mr. Sachse, Special Assistant Attorney General of Louisiana who will say a few words in behalf of their state.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.672" offset="522010">We are in agreement that the case is not bear on the question of how to delineate their (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="112.285" offset="552521">The issue in this case is on this motion -- in this case is whether in delineating the nine-mine -- nine-mile belt which was granted to Texas by the Submerged Lands Act as construed by this Court several terms ago whether in measuring that belt, one begins measuring out from artificial harbor-works which project into the gulf or rather whether as we contend, you begin measuring out that belt from the natural shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.074" offset="707688">Now the question is here because as it happens, they're all rather long jetties that Galveston and Sabine Pass projecting into the gulf some two or three miles and some distance into the gulf from those jetties all valuable oil lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.400" offset="772995">Well, what's the measure Mr. Claiborne of the difference between the 1845 where the 1845 line would be and from which Texas contends the measurement should be?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="179.333" offset="820746">Assuming Mr. Justice Brennan that the 1845 shoreline is very much like the present shoreline, the difference between measuring out from the shoreline and measuring out from the jetties, the ends of the jetties as would be the rule under the California case is some two to three miles an arc of that diameter, I've got the right geometry, that much more into the gulf in the shape of an arc.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="221.321" offset="988662">That is not entirely clear because that part of the coast was not fully mapped in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.587" offset="1021680">However, we do have maps dating from some years thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.214" offset="1040280">I would hope as I will say in conclusion that should the Court sustain our first position which is that he must go -- he must measure out from that 1845 shoreline as it then existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.636" offset="1101928">But nevertheless, it may well turn out that as a matter of administrative compromise because there had been both accretion and erosion, the United States and the State of Texas might amicably agree to stipulate that the present shoreline is the shoreline as of 1845.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.315" offset="1196596">It could be determined with some approximation based on these later maps but still there would be some problems if the parties could not stipulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.167" offset="1256051">I would have every hope that the parties could even stipulate what the 1845 shoreline was or stipulate the present shoreline is as a practical matter sufficiently close to that old shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.954" offset="1307146">There has been relatively little accretion or erosion on the Texas coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.917" offset="1331075">Now, I do not mean to imply by saying this that we have explored with Texas what agreement they would or would not be willing to enter into should the decision go as we would urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.328" offset="1380707">I should add even now that we do have an alternative argument which is that if the shoreline isn't fixed on the ground as it was in 1849 -- 1845, the boundary might be viewed as an ambulatory one which would now include the present shoreline but not artificial harbor-works to take in into the gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.672" offset="1482062">In that instance of course, there's no problem about fixing the boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.777" offset="1498467">No problem about simply discounting the projections of the jetties.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.360" offset="1612779">Oh, of course Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.973" offset="1619257">We simply -- when we speak of the nine-mile or three-league boundary, we're simply referring back to where you begin to measure it out from and that's the only relevance of the shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.512" offset="1669413">We're not of course contesting that Texas is entitled to a nine-mile belt, that's the measurements.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.374" offset="1704835">Now, as I say, the question here arises because there are valuable oil lands at the end of the jetties projecting out in Galveston and Sabine Pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.188" offset="1748093">And because in the California case at the 64 term, this Court determined to adopt the rule of the international convention on the territorial sea in the contiguous zone to the effect that a coastline does include artificial harbor-works, permanent artificial harbor-works and that the territorial sea is measured from the ends of those works.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.403" offset="1860942">So that if the California decision were applicable to Texas, it would follow that its nine-mile belt should begin from the ends -- begin to be measured from the ends of those jetties.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.144" offset="1919979">Now, because this leads Texas to say, why shouldn't we be treated like everyone else?</text>
            <text syncTime="459.800" offset="1942549">Why doesn't the California decision applied to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.141" offset="1959894">It applies to Louisiana as they demonstrate at some length in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.087" offset="1979747">The Government has always conceded that it apply to Louisiana or in California and while the Government had conceded in that, this Court so held in the California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.327" offset="2024678">Now the answer why Texas is to be treated differently in this sense in our view is that Texas, unlike every other state except Florida has a belt which is determined by history not by the arbitrary three-mile belt that was granted under the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.214" offset="2132198">The Submerged Lands Act as the Court will remember gave every coastal state a three-mile belt of submerged lands, measured out from its present coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.948" offset="2187160">And under this Court's decision in the California case as I've said, present coastline would include permanent harbor-works.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.363" offset="3220773">The Submerged Lands Act first granted each of the states three -- a three-mile belt measured out from their present coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.027" offset="3255463">That's through the states on the Atlantic, on the Pacific and in the Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.602" offset="3273749">The Submerged Lands Act -- that claim is available to Texas like to every other state and it doesn't -- Texas is still free to make a claim under that provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.686" offset="3330069">And perhaps it would be helpful if I refer to the Act itself which is -- relevant portions of which are reprinted on pages 25 through 27 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.711" offset="3386180">Now this first grant, the three-mile grant is perhaps -- well, it's specified twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.053" offset="3427558">On page 26, Section 3 is the actual granting provision that if you read it, it will tell you nothing about how much is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.836" offset="3470712">It simply says, what is granted is the lands between navigable waters to the boundary of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.441" offset="3497148">So we have to turn back to Section 2 to find out what those terms mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.176" offset="3520031">In Section -- we're now on page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.150" offset="3531943">Section 2(a)(2) provides that lands under navigable waters means first, lands and I skip to the third line, seaward to align three geographical miles distant from the coastline of each such state.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.319" offset="3616684">That's the first grant that applies to each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.582" offset="3625671">Now, the same idea will be found in Section 4 on pages 26 and 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.426" offset="3661093">It said there that each of the original states has a three-mile boundary from its present coastline and that any subsequently admitted state may extend its boundary two to three miles from its present coastline and it may do so at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.393" offset="3732982">So the practical effect of this is that each state got a three-mile belt measured out from its present coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.363" offset="3760776">And as I say, that's available to Texas but that is not what Texas chose to claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.389" offset="3784913">Texas claims rather under the second part of Section 2(a)(2) on page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.480" offset="3821275">After the part I just read, it says that submerged -- lands between -- beneath navigable waters also means lands -- seaward three miles from the coast and to such boundary line of each such states where in any case, such boundary as it existed at the time such state became a member of the Union or is here to -- before approved by Congress extends seaward beyond three geographical miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.020" offset="3947499">So Texas is making this claim for something over the normal three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.503" offset="3973413">In Section 4 incidentally, we find out or rather in Section (a) -- Section 2(a)(b), we found out that this claim for anything over three miles applies only to the Gulf States and not to the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.526" offset="4081455">Texas in other words claims to its historic boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.642" offset="4101935">There are two types of historic boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.637" offset="4109876">One is the boundary of the state when it came to the Union, the other is a boundary subsequently approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.430" offset="4145089">Florida was in the second case, Texas is in the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.603" offset="4161808">It claims the boundary that it had at the time it entered the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.361" offset="4200782">Now the Act says nothing about how you measure that boundary, how you determine that boundary as it existed when you came into the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.824" offset="4250624">It doesn't say that you measure it out from the coastline, it doesn't say of course how wide it is and there's a good reason for this that historic boundary may not have been related to the coast at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.147" offset="4307989">It may not have been X miles from the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.652" offset="4321991">It might have been a fixed line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.113" offset="4331813">Louisiana at one time claimed a line of boundary on the 27th parallel that was not parallel to the coast or not exactly parallel to the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.071" offset="4371623">It might have been a line made up of straight lines between reefs that were not even distance from the coast at all points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.675" offset="4410075">Or finally, it might have been a boundary that is defined in terms of so many miles from the high water mark rather than the low water mark which is what coastline means in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.501" offset="4461380">Because of all these possibilities, quite naturally, the Act did not say where a historic boundary is measured out from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.850" offset="4518745">What the Act in effect says that whenever you have a historic boundary, whenever you can establish a historic boundary that is somewhere between three and nine miles from the present coast, you're entitled to all the land -- all the submerged land enclosed within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.813" offset="4598575">I say not exceeding nine miles because the Act puts an outer limit, a maximum of nine miles from the present coast as the most that any states even a gulf state could get.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.277" offset="4872443">Now, the net result of these grants by the Submerged Lands Act is that any state which had a historic boundary that was more than nine miles from its present coast would get nine miles from its present coast including harbor-works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.017" offset="4947466">Any state that had a historic boundary of less than three miles from its present coast could now claim three miles from its present coast.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.479" offset="5037328">Now, because all the Gulf States made claims to boundaries beyond the three-mile grant that everyone else received, trying to set up historic boundaries but only two of them prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.721" offset="5094275">They were Texas and Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.543" offset="5109530">It so happens and I think this is the source of the confusion that Texas' historic boundary is a nine-mile three-league boundary measured more or less from the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.996" offset="5167313">The question is whether that nine-mile belt which is a matter of history was the Texas boundary is coextensive with the nine-mile maximum which would be measured from the present coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.440" offset="5237112">We say it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.569" offset="5245680">But in any event, the question whether those two boundaries are coextensive cannot be resolved by looking to the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.867" offset="5278804">That question has to be resolved by looking to the historical documents which determine where the old boundary was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.280" offset="5308479">The Submerged Lands Act is not going to tell us that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.464" offset="5329272">All the Submerged Lands Act says is that Texas or any state in this comparable position may take to its old boundary as it existed at the time it came into the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.426" offset="5397086">Now in the case of Texas, the historic document that is relevant to fixing the historic boundary is as this Court found in the case entitled United States versus Louisiana or in Texas etcetera is the Texas Boundary Act, the Boundary Act of 1836 which was passed by the Republic of Texas and which was deemed to have been accepted by the United States when Texas was admitted to the Union in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.325" offset="5524668">And it is to that document that we must look to determine where the Texas boundary was and whether it was nine miles from the present coastline which on its face seems unlikely if there's been any change in the coastline or rather whether it was nine miles from some other baseline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.360" offset="5604812">Now at this point, Texas really abandons the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.379" offset="5628844">None of their brief is addressed to the question what nine miles from land means in the Boundary Act of 1836.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.027" offset="5675447">Texas' entire position here is that the Submerged Lands Act tells us where the Texas' historic boundary was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.029" offset="5711496">If we are right that the Submerged Lands Act does not resolve this question, I take it and I maybe corrected that Texas has no further argument to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.427" offset="5761128">And that's not surprising because if one accepts our position that the 1836 Act fixes the old historic boundary of Texas, it's perfectly plain that that boundary had no relation to the present coastline but have relation rather to the coastline as it existed at that time or a few years later in 1845 when the state was admitted to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.832" offset="5886725">Now as I've said, the Texas Boundary Act sets a boundary for Texas in the gulf three leagues from land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.301" offset="5924551">Three leagues being the first nine miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.515" offset="5937403">Now we assume that land in that context means below water mark along the shoreline rather than the high water mark or some intermediate point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.475" offset="5981288">In that respect, we accept the notion that the waterline involved is the same kind of waterline that is spoken of in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.205" offset="6036146">But there are at least three reasons why harbor-works cannot have been included in this nine-mile belt that Texas had as a matter of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.900" offset="6082957">The first and really dispositive reason is that these harbor-works did not exist in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.585" offset="6109706">Indeed, there were no harbor-works thus stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.451" offset="6125171">There were no harbor-works projecting from the Texas coast in 1845 when that state was admitted in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.632" offset="6157876">Furthermore, the international practice of fixing international boundaries in the sense of territorial sea from artificial harbor-works is a practice that developed very much later and was not current in 1845 and because it's wholly unlikely that Texas having no harbor-works of its own would have devised a new and radical way of defining its own boundary contrary to the then international practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.151" offset="6308028">Finally and I've even stressed this, land, the word used by the Texas Boundary Act, tends to connote not artificial structures added but rather the natural shoreline.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.419" offset="6425057">It would extend the boundary but that was because water boundaries as then as now all viewed as ambulatory to the extent that natural and perceptible accretion or erosion occurs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.380" offset="6532890">And to the extent that the Submerged Lands Act is viewed as confirming the Texas historic boundary as it would exist today, we would have to concede that any accretions or erosions by natural forces should be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.916" offset="6611048">It doesn't seem to us however that that's really what the Submerged Lands Act has in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.647" offset="6633932">It seems to us rather that when the Act speaks of the boundary as it existed at the time of admission, it means as it was then located and as I've pointed out that it could present problems of retracing the boundary but I think those problems could be worked out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.137">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.368">We thank the United States Court permitting us to have a few minutes of its time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.875">Our purpose in being here this morning is to bring to the Court's attention that Louisiana has filed a motion for a supplemental decree number two in an effort to have recognized the coastline of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.672">Mr. Archibald Cox and Mr. Louis Claiborne have informed us that they would be ready to respond to our motion by December 1st which the time is agreeable to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.008">When that motion is before the Court, arguments that really are germane to the Louisiana situation will be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.930">We expect to show that the coastline of Louisiana is in the water, at the outer limit of inland waters that this line has been designated and defined by duly authorized agencies of the Federal Government, accepted and approved by Louisiana historically, economically and necessarily established for the benefit of the United States as a nation and the State of Louisiana as a part of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.146">We are concerned not with the narrow issue between Texas and the United States in this matter where they talk about a harbor-work or a jetty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.039">But we are concerned that the language used may somehow impinge upon the argument as between Louisiana and the United States without it being noted as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.750">For example, arguments relating to shore, arguments relating to the land and nothing to do with the Louisiana situation, the Submerged Lands Act sets a definition of coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.840">The Act of admission of Louisiana into the Union deals with coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.406">This Court has recognized in the California case an essential distinction between our situation and the California situation or the Texas situation when Justice Harlan for the Court referred to the waters of Louisiana that are not truly navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.933">And we are anxious not to have these issues overlooked or somehow or another confused by argument of counsel who are not concerned with that issue at this present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.571">I would like to call to the Court's attention that when this litigation commenced, Louisiana was the only state before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.950">And after we had our first argument in April of 1957, the Court received the brief from Texas in having res -- which was not a party to the case and having received the brief from Texas, the Court then barely said as we point out in our motion that the issues in this litigation are so related to the possible interest of Texas and other states situated in the Gulf of Mexico in the subject matter of this suit that a just, orderly and effective determination of such issues requires that they'd be adjudicated in a proceeding in which all the interested parties are before the Court and the Court then invited the other states into the action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Houghton Brownlee, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3283.293">The Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.663">I'd like to point out first of all that on our brief we had as our counsel, the former Governor and Senator from Texas, Price Daniel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.743">We were very sorry that he was unable to make this argument this morning for this day but he has accepted a job for the President and he had to refuse himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.465">But I can assure you that every word in there, in our brief has his thorough thought in backing and it's just as if he were here today as far as our brief is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.299">I'm sorry that we missed on having the benefit of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.754">This leads me to our first point and let me simply state our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.287">It's very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.224">Texas' position is that the California case did settle this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.670">We think that inland waters are involved here and that we have an inland water problem and that this is a key just it was -- as it was in the California case to a proper decision by the Court for arriving at our coastline as defined in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.171">Now, the Government has apparently taken the position that well, we must go back to 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.028">Why, because that -- prior to that time we had an old boundary act on the republic statute books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.728">Of course we were here in 1947 urging this Court to accept that old boundary act as our proper boundary and the Court turned it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.373">It was rejected and the Court said, "We never had any title out there".</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.214">When we joined the Union we lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.850">So whatever grant we got came from the Submerged Lands Act it did not come from the old boundary act of the original Republic of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.697">It came strictly from the Submerged Lands Act from the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.051">Now, our position is simply this that the Congress intended only one baseline or coastline for all of the gulf coast of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.975">Whether the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic or the Pacific coast or how could Congress had known in the first place, which of the states if any on the gulf coast might be able to prove up some additional historic distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.409">We say that the word historic boundary as that term was used in debate and so forth refers to historic distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.428">It was used with reference to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.453">It was used with reference to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.383">It was used with reference to all of the states not just the State of Texas or the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.939">So that we do not see how the Government gets this -- out of this particular part of the statute that they quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.452">Now, let's look at again Section 2 and I'm not going to read the whole thing but I merely want to point out that it gives each state and this is all at the same time three miles from the coast then it says, "and to such additional historic distance" and I'm interpolating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.950">That's the way we read the act as the state may prove of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.738">It does not say that you have to back up, switch around and start out with an entirely new baseline if you are fortunate enough to be able to prove up an additional historic distance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Houghton Brownlee, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3506.229">That's correct and I think what they were referring to there was the historic distance and the historic boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.109">I'll tell you why I think so and why I think this is important to keep in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.378">There was an effort on the part of Louisiana and if you go back and read the California case, the Court went into this history in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.882">Louisiana did want an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.240">They did think that they would have an additional step out, like they could get a big advantage out of this if they had an option of either relying on the ancient boundary or the present coastline regardless of whether that can prove their historic distance or the -- in the additional three miles or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.728">Well, of course the Congress turned this down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.868">It never got into the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.468">That does not say you can either do this or do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.551">It merely defines coastline and I would point out that the decree in this case and in the California case adopted those very words in defining coastlines and in defining where inland waters commence where we start measuring from.</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.320">You have to get to the outer limit before you commence measuring grants, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.421">And none of the convention the waters within these jetties are within inland waters and we have stipulated that this particular harbor-works would qualify under the convention as that type of harbor work that would be assimilated to the coast.</text>

            <label>Mr. Houghton Brownlee, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3670.933">No sir, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.738">As a matter of fact, that is one of the stipulations which we have filed with the Court, stipulation number three which I now read that jetties at Sabine Pass and Galveston Harbor are permanent harbor-works constituting integral parts of the harbor system within the meaning of Article 8 of the conventional (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.668">There's no issue on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.021">That I suppose might be a fact issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.108">There are no fact issues in this case as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.489">We stipulated to the plain facts that the jetties weren't there in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.859">They weren't -- they were completed about 1909 as a matter of fact, Galveston and the ones that Sabine Pass before the turn of the century, they've been there a long, long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.452">They've been repaired and so forth but in their present form as they are now, we also stipulated that they were there and exist in their present form in 1953 when the Submerged Lands Act was passed if that's a relevant date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.777">The reason I point this out is that in the California case, this Court will remember the Government first took the position before the Submerged Lands Act was passed and while the case was before the special master that California was relegated to its ancient historic boundary, the 1850 date of admission boundary and that no harbor-works or other structures built since that time should be included within the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.467">Then after the Submerged Lands Act was passed, the Government conceded that time that yes, it was the intention of the Act not to go back to 1850 but get up to 18 -- 19 -- to 1953 and stop right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.601">In other words, they conceded that it was the intention of Congress to go ahead and see to the state all harbor-works or built up land or anything of that nature that existed as of the date of the passage of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.057">Many references were made in their briefs and I'm not going to quote them here, they are quoted in our brief but to the fact that the gift was a present gift and so forth and that no future build up should be acquired by California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.368">They were willing to stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.140">Then as recently as -- well, it was just a year or so ago, they agreed with Louisiana that off their coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.797">They would go ahead and accept the jetties at (Inaudible) Pass has formed the part of the baseline or the coast and if the waters were inland waters within those jetties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.526">So we are faced really -- we're really almost back to the original 1947 California contention of the ancient boundary because of the historic boundary idea, because they're claiming that we have to go back to 1845 when they admit that we can't find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.859">We don't know where it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.601">We have no adequate maps or anything to let us know where it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.512">I just can't see this from their reading of this one paragraph out of the Act levered and twisted just exactly to give it this interpretation when there are so many other things in the Act itself and in the history of the Act to indicate the Congress was talking about present boundaries, a modern coastline and not an ancient coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.052">For example and we pointed out the language, the terms are in present -- it's not on either are, it's not as they did exist back in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.801">There's nothing to tie it down to an ancient boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.344">In fact everything indicates that the concept that everyone had was not to get involved in all of the difficulties that would necessarily be involved in attempting to fix an ancient coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.385">I think this Court very properly and very wisely took the view in the California case that a modern coastline concept was exactly what the Congress had in mind when it passed the Act that the Court itself was given the job, the responsibility of making those definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.534">The Court did make those definitions in the California case and they said we adopt them for the purpose of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4029.697">I would also point out to the Court that -- and this again goes back to the history of the California case that when the Government first filed its complaint in a motion for relief, file a complaint in the California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.374">It specifically excluded harbor-works.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.846">These were left out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.255">So the decree left them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.466">And when we got to the 1947 -- I mean the 1950 case in Texas and Louisiana, the same pattern was followed and the decree left that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.482">It was never anything that took away from Texas what was left by the decree and that included all the harbor-works, all of the inland waters and of course the jetties were there at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.020">So as far as the grant is concern, we think we got our grant from the Submerged Lands Act of a historic distance of three leagues, measured from a modern coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.800">Now, it would seem to me that in order for the plaintiff to get to their alternative point number two that they must establish their first point which is the ancient boundary theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.779">In other words, you don't get to the alternative until you prove your first premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.984">That's absolutely nothing in the Act that we've been able to find or in the legislative history that would indicate this sort of intent in the part of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="4162.435">Mr. Houghton Brownlee preceded here the -- I noticed the printed docket showed otherwise and I explained that -- so you'll understand that was Mr. Price Daniel was to make it -- opening argument because he had made the argument in 1950 and also in 1960 for this Court and he was employed by the State of Texas and did the briefing in this matter and Mr. Brownlee just took his place in the matter -- in the case -- excuse me sirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.460">I think generally speaking, the Solicitor had been quite fair in his brief and argument in meeting the weakness of the Government's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.115">However, that one argument of that which is not exactly fair and I think is completely erroneous and refer plaintiff's contention here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4247.437">He said, we are thinking to combine the most favorable elements of these two rules in order to end up a more land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.777">Well, that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.406">Not necessarily so.</text>

            <text syncTime="4317.624">Now, let me say in the first place that beginning with the coastline, we're only attempting -- gentlemen, we're only attempting and we're not trying to gain advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.181">We're only attempting to follow what we think Congress -- intended what the Congress said and what you confirmed in the 1965 California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.234">In addition to that, we feel like that the Calcasieu -- the Louisiana case also carry that part so a far as the gulf is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.969">Now, I want to talk in just a moment about just the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.182">Second place is modern coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.825">It's not always the most favored in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.728">We have now before us Galveston Island where Americans stormed 1900, I think everyone heard of the 1900 storm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.928">Congress had a hearing on that and they found that in a House document, a beach erosion in Galveston, Texas which is cited at page 28 in our brief and I'll read from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.536">Early surveyed of shore show that prior to construction of the jetty, there was an extensive erosion on most of the reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.171">Now, what they we mean reach is the east beach to the 10th Street but a maximum section of shoreline from 1838 to 1875 of about 2,000 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.877">Now, that is cited to you to show that this is the very point that we're talking about in this case of the Galveston jetty close to it and we certainly -- 2,000 feet projected out into the gulf would probably give us more the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.414">I may say also that we don't interpret this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.234">Maybe the justice department might change their mind about -- we don't interpret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.549">We can come and go and select is -- what we want and what part of the beach should go up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.481">If I understood that correctly, we don't -- we didn't know that and we're not standing on that this morning because we didn't know that -- didn't understand that to be the position of the United States because we thought that we had to choose once and choose only once and once we chose, we had to stand by it and that's the position we've taken here this morning and that our entire coast stands on the proof of our historic boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.074">At Galveston, we have this present coast is much less than it was in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.479">Our trouble there of course is -- Justice Harlan said a minute ago pointed out that it's almost impossible to determine where the coast was in 1845 because in -- prior to -- along in the middle 50's there was no maps and even up until the present time that parts of the beach have never been exactly charted and that's why -- let me explain right in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.567">That's why that the matter was left to this Court as stated in the California case rather in Congress try to put it in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.088">You remembered one time in the hearings is brought out in the California case that the attorney general brought in and thought they would attach a map to the Act and this would settle everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.396">Will it create such a few or that it -- it will soon drop out and the mapped part was not there anymore at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.607">Now, I want to go to -- back to the law gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.289">Regardless of which the Governments hurts or helps, I think Mr. Brownlee's arguments in our brief clearly shows Submerged Lands Act contains only one baseline and one coastline and that's our contention here and I don't think it was quite brought out enough in our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.741">We have stipulated as far as the facts are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.529">We don't stipulate to force foreign law because it wouldn't be binding on this Court that there were no artificial harbor-works or other structures existing in the gulf and in Texas in 1845 but the most important one is here and that is the jetties at Sabine, that's where --locally, we pronounced it Sabine and Galveston harbor, our permanent harbor-works constituting an integral part of our harbor system within the meaning of Article 8 of the convention of the territorial sea and taking a contiguous zone and that is as far as I can see is there is no fact question gentlemen.</text>

            <text syncTime="4811.070">First, the -- let me say this that the government's chief witness and advisor in the California case, Mr. Aaron L. Shalowitz, one of the leading experts in sea and shore boundaries while he was in Florida by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, he wrote a book and has always desired when you're arguing if the other fellow write a book.</text>

            <text syncTime="4855.854">This is the interpretation of the Submerged Lands Act they put out in order so they might have some guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.480">I begin reading in the middle of the page, reading that as a whole together with the discussions however it seems reasonable to assume that what the Congress wished to preserve for the states was a concept of distance, fixed as of the date of admission, three miles or six miles and so forth rather than the concept of a fixed line in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.053">Under this interpretation, the historic distance would be applied to the present coastline to fix out a boundary of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.352">And I drop on down -- he's got just a little bit more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.077">If this the -- the Submerged Lands Act is encored with the common law rule which is a federal rule that where the sea is a boundary, the doctrine of erosion and accretion is normally applicable and the boundary shifts with the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.102">And if you bear with me just a moment, I won't to read one more sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.019">From the practical point of view, the sea or present coastline is a logical solution or it would be exceeded difficult if not impossible task to determine the line of ordinary low water mark in a distant past talking about the past years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.263">Act -- that surveys of our coast did not begin to come available until the middle of the 19th Century and in mini-sections of low waterline is never actually been surveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.375">That I think is this man, as far as I can see is a well-reasoned book and not just because it was but it -- he has done a tremendous job.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.600">Now, I want to pass another question and that is that the Government in this case took the exact opposite view in the California case and in that case, of course this Court found against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.575">And the Solicitor General of the United States gave his interpretations exactly in the final brief in the California case and I want to quote from it since it's -- we feel directly in point, "We now concede that the Submerged Lands Act by making a grant measure from the coastline in existence the day of the Act has given the state the benefit of artificial works in existence at that time".</text>

            <text syncTime="5041.631">Of course that's all cited in our brief Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.115">Now then, the Solicitor's brief on page 16 makes a further concession that the interpretation sought here by the Government may be incorrect and already foreclosed by the basic opinion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.353">And what we've -- what we -- what we're working with here this morning is what is in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.154">Some of the things that were said here this morning, we were taken a little bit by surprise, but we're going to define or argue the best that we can to what we -- what is in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.196">I start here, it says the reading, and that's on page 16, the reading of the Submerged Lands Act just suggested is not the only permissible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.177">I want to show you the Government says that you can interpret it either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.673">The purpose of Congress in granting the Gulf States the submerged land within their boundaries as they existed, that's in quotation, when the state was admitted to the Union may well have been to give each such state not the particular area what -- that it claimed at the time but the area it would today enjoy if its historic boundary had been effective against the claims of the United States held to be paramount in United States versus Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.724">There's a support for this view in the Court's first opinion in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.953">And we feel like that in closing, we feel like that that is exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.659">I want to say in one of the footnotes here, you'll find that -- and I believe co-counsel mentioned a minute ago, but I'm afraid maybe the Court, some of you didn't hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.728">Mr. Justice, I will comment Attorney General Clark at that time when he filed his original case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.784">That's about taking in new harbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.300">It was a great out draft about the matter and in his brief in the footnote, we have it in our brief here, he said we do not and do not in -- at any time intend to take the harbor-work, claim them to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.344">That was in his footnote there and that's the reason why when you go in to the reading of the Congressional Journal and there are hearings you don't find a lot to talk about it because the Government had no time intended the -- claimed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.223">Not until we got this particular complaint a few months ago that we know that the Government at any time intended to because what you have here is you have a very narrow issue like -- as I understand the Government's case, they say we want to come back and we want to start your baseline or your coastline, it means one thing to Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.692">And California, Louisiana, your coastline means something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.617">We feel like that the Act only contained one definition of coastline and one definition only and is applicable to both of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.420">Now, in closing, gentlemen, I want to read to you just a moment a little bit more and I'll be through.</text>

            <text syncTime="5235.931">That is the original decree of this -- in this case, this is -- I believe have been -- brought out a lot of rule but I want to make -- they'll be sure about it because this is I think is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.242">Decree in this case has awarded Texas title to the submerged lands seaward from its present coastline including the harbor-works and this -- go into the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.344">The Act says, coastline -- and in the decree, the decree that this Court entered said the coastline means a line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact to the open sea and the line marking the seaward limits of inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.454">As against the United States, the defendant states are respectfully entitled to all lands, minerals, and other natural resources underlying the Mex -- the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.531">I didn't just say Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.692">I'm talking about the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.069">This is your decree, entering seaward from their coastline for a distance of three leagues in the case of Texas in Florida and three geographic miles in the case of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, and the United States is not entitled as against any such state to any interest in such lands, minerals or resources with exceptions provided under Section 5, which is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.738">Now that's -- that is 43 U.S.C. 1313.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.020">When this code -- when this decree was entered in December the 12th, 1960, the term coastline, I call your attention, that the term coastline had already been defined in a gulf so far as I concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.480">I think it was certain there United States recognized as early in their brief show, as early as 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.785">They recognized that the inland waters included the harbor-works.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.278">I agree with you that it was in fact in 1836 because it was of no concern at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.910">But in 1930, this nation began and I want to say that the treaty that was entered into in 1958 ordinary thing in the world but codifying, I think the Government was (Inaudible) read this was not anything would work but codifying what the rule already was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.745">And in that debate over there on adopting the treaty, since this is footnoted in our brief, when it was adopted, I believe, "No way".</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.426">They said, "No, no, let's put the word "may' in there" and the French came back and said, (Inaudible) came back and said, "No sir, we will leave the word "shall' in there and that is in the treaty, shall be, include the harbor-works".</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.548">Now, that's our position in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.776">Gentlemen, we feel that the 1958 rule had been further confirmed by this treaty and your adoptions of the treaty as your rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.542">And therefore the case as far as Texas is concerned that there'd only be one coastline and that the Congress didn't intend two coastlines, it'd be one coastline and it would be applicable to all the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="5428.952">First, a word about Louisiana, perhaps I've been too accommodating.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.768">I'm taken by surprise by the suggestion Louisiana makes that in no event should this case be decided until the arguments with respect to the Louisiana coastlines are to be settled and that case conceivably may require reference to a master and therefore delay the resolution of this one for a very long time if that suggestion were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.532">I had thought Louisiana agreed with us that this case has nothing whatever to do with Louisiana or with the Louisiana coastline but the principle involved here cannot under -- in any way affect Louisiana, though it can affect Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.898">As to Florida, I appreciate the fact that Florida perhaps should be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.841">I, on the other hand, feel that perhaps that's their responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.722">They had been said with all papers in this case from the very beginning had chosen not to appear because they appear not to be concerned, and I don't know that this rather pressing dispute should be delayed on that account.</text>

            <text syncTime="5522.273">I remind the Court that this proceeding began by an ex parte restraining order issued on one day's notice by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.015">It involves valuable islands which neither side is drilling at the moment under an agreement not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.542">And unlike the Louisiana case where there's a working agreement which permits drilling in the interim, here there is none and here I speak perhaps more on behalf of Texas than on behalf of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.308">Texas has voluntarily withheld any action in this area and I don't know that they should be required to do so indefinitely simply because Louisiana has what I concede to be unjustified fears if this Court's going astray in its decision here.</text>
