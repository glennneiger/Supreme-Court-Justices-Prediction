            <text syncTime="37.589" offset="253680">A state court injunction prohibits as trespass on private property, peaceful picketing by union men and women in front of a supermarket located within a shopping center, informing the public that the store is nonunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.442" offset="329122">These employees are not receiving union wages or other union benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.328" offset="356707">We have three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.804" offset="366634">One, is this prohibition of peaceful picketing within the shopping center an abridgment of First Amendment rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="75.547" offset="405608">Two, is the conduct within the sole governance of the National Labor Relations Board so that the state court has no power to deal with it at all and three, if the state court is empowered to deal with the conduct, does the injunction prohibit the federally protected right conferred by the National Labor Relations Act to engage in peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.789" offset="522533">Now these questions arise in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.566" offset="537684">Logan Valley Mall is a shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.371" offset="552835">At the time of the events in this case, it was newly opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.222" offset="568299">It's a pretty big shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.362" offset="576867">It expands a perimeter of about 1.1 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.714" offset="594213">It is located at the intersection of two public highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.583" offset="613752">The highways are separated from the shopping center by what are called earthen berms which is an earthen embankment with a ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.705" offset="650219">The highways are separated from the shopping center by earthen berms, B E R M S embankments, they're just -- it's just dirt road and that's about all I can see that it means there's a ditch along this berm.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.349" offset="708733">This is unbroken except for five paved entrances which provide ingress and egress to the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.330" offset="740707">The paved entrances are about 20-feet in width, the berms vary from 12 to 15 feet in width.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.081" offset="775711">Now, from the entrances to the shopping center and the Weis Supermarket which is the store involved in this case, entrances one and two are about 350 feet distant.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.048" offset="831613">Entrance three a little further and entrance four and five are about 450 to 500 feet from the highway entrance to the Weis Supermarket.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.275" offset="1284472">On December 17th, picketing began.The average numbers of pickets were five, six or seven.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.006" offset="3419408">Now, when the injunction was issued in this case, picketing went on until December 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.589" offset="3449710">An ex parte injunction was issued on that day in joining trespassing and picketing on the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.411" offset="3488998">The consequence was to take these people away from in front of the supermarket and put them at the highway entrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.363" offset="3520867">They continue to picket at the highway entrances in numbers of one or two, except that one entrance which served only the Sears, Roebuck Automotive Station and there, they didn't picket at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.443" offset="3569142">At the same time, they began to distribute leaflets at the points of the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.303" offset="3592547">The leaflet said, We appeal to our friends and members of organized labor not to patronize this nonunion market.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.785" offset="3654510">Please patronize union markets ANP, Quaker, Acme.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.866" offset="3670810">We still retain the right to ask the public not to patronize nonunion markets and the public has the right not to patronize nonunion markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.782" offset="3710516">On January 4, 1966, the union moved to dissolve the injunction and it made substantially two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.186" offset="3740087">One that picketing within the shopping center in front of the supermarket premises was an exercise of the right of free speech; and two, that the state court by reason of the National Labor Relations Act had no power to deal with the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.509" offset="3801422">An evidentiary hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.380" offset="3812916">The injunction was made permanent and on February 14, 1966 and the injunction prohibited in so far as it is material to the question we want to bring here, trespassing and picketing on the shopping center premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.320" offset="3880626">And the court -- the Court of Common Plea supported that injunction on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.573" offset="3901628">One, it said this was private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.417" offset="3916988">It has been opened only to that part of the public which will make a profit for the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.855" offset="3942797">It has not been opened to that part of the public with a labor message which will cause the store within the shopping center to lose money.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.588" offset="3977697">And the court said secondly -- this is the Court of Common Pleas -- that the object of the picketing was to coerce the employer to force Weis' employees to belong to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.626" offset="4033912">Now, if the injunction were to stand on that premise, it would be clearly preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.437" offset="4053138">It would be clearly a matter within the control solely of the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.255" offset="4072364">But the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in affirming did not rest on the ground of coercion of union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.743" offset="4106324">It said it need not reach that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.354" offset="4116773">It supported the injunction solely on the ground that this was a trespass and like the Court of Common Pleas, it said the shopping center has invited to this place only those who will benefit it economically and has not made its invitation to all of the world, particularly not to those who would be on economic disadvantage to the stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.640" offset="4229935">There was a dissent with the divided court four to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.246" offset="4244355">The dissent made two points.One, this was an exercise of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.096" offset="4267760">You cannot open the shopping center to part of the community and close it to the rest of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.246" offset="4288345">And two, there were irreconcilable conflicts between the injunction and rights conferred by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.712" offset="4322200">That brings us to our First Amendment point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.277" offset="4340485">Free speech or picketing rather, peaceful picketing is the working man means of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.404" offset="4369011">It is the way in conventional labor disputes that the public is told the facts of the labor dispute from the working man's point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.213" offset="4420211">Why then can it be prohibited in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.301" offset="4436616">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court gives us one answer, it says, it's private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.165" offset="4460022">The title to the property belongs to a private holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.470" offset="4477262">And to that, we think the short answer is the property is private but the use is public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.008" offset="4515401">This shopping center is open to the shopper and the would be shopper, to the employee and the would be employee, to teamsters delivering goods to the stores and the salesmen trying to sell to the stores, to the garbage collector, the policemen, the postmen, to everybody in the community that makes this center function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.051" offset="4599620">Its whole reason for being is its openness to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.623" offset="4613831">It's a public marketplace and on our view, when you open your property to the public in that fashion, you cannot pick and choose among that part of the public which you were let in and that part which you will exclude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.537" offset="6101556">Sir, I cannot quarrel with a view that peaceful picketing because it has aspects of conduct, as well as speech, has been suggested by Your Honor to the totally prohibitable as a matter of constitutional law with the sole differentiation being that a government cannot discriminate and allow some peaceful picketing to some and prohibited to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.778" offset="6218480">I can say with respect to that distinction solely that I do not think this Court has embraced it and I should hope that it would not embrace it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.350" offset="6264769">Now, if we are right, if we are right that this peaceful picketing cannot be prohibited, if it is conducted on a street which faces on a publicly or municipally owned street, then the sole distinction we have is who owns the title to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.847" offset="6350764">If you have title in the municipality, it's constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.728" offset="6374275">If you have title in a private holder, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.582" offset="6389739">And we suggest that the test is not who owns the property, the municipality or a private owner, but whether that property, whoever owns it, has been opened to public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.231" offset="6444283">And in our view, this is a very small extension, if indeed and extension at all, to what this Court said in Marsh v. Alabama where it said, The more ownership does not always mean absolute dominion, the more an owner for his advantage opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.051" offset="6575626">We think here when a shopping center opens its doors to the public-wide, it cannot shut out that part of the public which has a labor dispute with the store within the shopping center and confine it to engaging in peaceful picketing more than a football business field away from the place where the dispute exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.943" offset="6679176">Now, the court below says well, these were never employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.424" offset="6701119">The pickets were never employees of Weis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.475" offset="6713240">We have no quarrels with our own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.972" offset="6723271">We have quarrels with other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.694" offset="6734137">We have no quarrels with our own.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.937" offset="6747094">And for that reason, the injunction is prohibitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.364" offset="6760782">But this Court settled that question a very long time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.450" offset="6777187">It said that you cannot, given the economic interdependence of industry today draw your circle of economic competition so tight as to contain only an employer and his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.584" offset="6833716">And then, an injunction of peaceful picketing cannot be sustained if it is based simply on the absence of an employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.882" offset="6874885">This idea keeps cropping up from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.593" offset="6889723">It's about as hard an idea to kill in this field as exists, but it's dead, it was killed in AFL v.

            <text syncTime="2146.182" offset="8688097">Now, with respect to the appropriateness of the place, there was a decision which came down on March 1, 1968, this -- just this last week by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which we have reprinted verbatim in a supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.214" offset="8756224">Now, at page 14-A, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit touches precisely on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.569" offset="8781615">This was a case in which people who wanted to protest the Vietnam policy of the administration wanted to come into the bus terminal in New York City because this was the place they could most appropriately reach the people they wanted to reach, and they didn't want to stand outside on the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.830" offset="8858728">And the Court of Appeals said this bus terminal is virtually the equivalent of an open thoroughfare and that the people had a right to be within the bus terminal in order to convey their message, and they said this specifically with respect to the kind of question which has just been asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.007" offset="8927378">The defendant, the bus -- the Port of New York Authority argues that the inappropriateness of the place is demonstrated by the fact that Walden's message, the fellow who wanted to propagandize against the Vietnam policy, there's no special relation to the operations of the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.928" offset="9007104">The propriety of a place for use as a public forum does turn on the relevance of the premises to the protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.758" offset="9042422">But this relationship may be found in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.905" offset="9059035">In some situations, the place represents the object of protest, the seat of authority against which the protest is directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.471" offset="9097279">In other situations, the place is where the relevant audience may be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.003" offset="9119431">So for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in either situation would make it an appropriate place in this -- and what they saw in the Second Circuit case was to picket to distribute handbills and to set up a table at which they could distribute literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.286" offset="9188498">Now, for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and for us, either would be enough to establish that it is an appropriate place to picket but we have much the easier of that case because on either test, this -- the premises of a supermarket is an appropriate place to picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.122" offset="9267911">Now, we're told that picketing is more than speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.768" offset="9286405">And of course, it is more than speech in the sense that picketing does involve a patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.624" offset="9313886">But to say that it is more than speech is not to say that it is not speech at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.998" offset="9339382">To say that it is more than speech under this Court's decision so far as I understand that means it can be prohibited if it serves a valid governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.124" offset="9391835">Now, the sole valid governmental interest suggested in this case is one the fair title to the property which we think is invalid because it ignores the distinction of the openness of the shopping center to the public, and secondly, the absence of an employer-employee relationship which we believe is invalid as well in the circumstances of our times and on the basis of this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.873" offset="9494862">So we have no way of supporting the injunction in this case upon the basis of it being in furtherance or the prohibition of picketing being in furtherance of a valid governmental interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2514.251" offset="10160358">Now, the reason I think specifically in this case that the rationale adopted by the court below is totally vulnerable is if that rationale were sound, it would prohibit not only peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.592" offset="10221693">It would prohibit the distribution of leaflets within the shopping center at the premises of the supermarket as well because in terms of whether the fellow was a trespasser, he's a trespasser just as much as if he's in there carrying a placard or if he's in there distributing leaflets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.681" offset="10294105">If being a trespasser is what is enough to prohibit the dissemination of information within this shopping center, you can stop leaflet distribution and you can stop picketing and you stop it by the same argument and there can be no distinction in terms of whether this is private property as to whether you entered to picket or you entered to distribute leaflets.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.634" offset="11741915">Now, we know that this statute is even more explicit than the generality of Section 7 in indicating the protection that Congress intends to give to peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.267" offset="11788413">For example, in prohibiting the secondary boycott, Congress explicitly accepts from the prohibition any primary strike or any primary picketing in regulating organizational or recognitional picketing with certain qualifications that explicitly allows any picketing or other publicity for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers, that an employer does not employ members of or have a contract with a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.380" offset="11924877">Surely then, this is arguably protected and the only answer or the only question really with respect to does it retain its arguably protective character is does it make a difference whether the picketing is conducted on the open but private property of the person with whom you had your dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4827.411" offset="19413034">There were 13 pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.608" offset="19421811">They did picket for abreast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.911" offset="19439052">This picketing took place at the point where customers entered with their cars and were Weis employees worked, thus employees, customers, pickets and cars intermingled resulting in confusion and congestion and that's a fact and it's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.778" offset="19550438">This is considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.987" offset="19559320">Now, the avowed purpose of the picketing was to inform the public that Weis employees were not members of the picketing union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.440" offset="19605086">The trial court after a full hearing continued a preliminary injunction and permitted these pickets to continue out on the berm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.118" offset="19639881">I might just call your attention to page 102 of the record where the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania noted this question that you were asking me a while ago concerning the effect of this injunction in footnote 4, the Court points out that the practical effect was to restrict picketing to the berm areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.364" offset="19732877">I mean this doesn't add anything to our colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.924" offset="19747088">I just thought I call your attention to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.602" offset="19761821">Now, as a result of this picketing out on the berm areas and I might say Your Honors that the berm areas as you can see from the picture, was a leveled area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.503" offset="19809364">It was easy to picket on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.846" offset="19822738">It was wide and there was no danger to the pickets and so the Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.107" offset="19843845">And as a result, not a single person entering the shopping center could be unaware of the union's message, the trial court so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.485" offset="19893269">The union argues initially that the state court had no power to regulate the picketing because it infringes on freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.618" offset="19949798">But as Your Honors have said, picketing is more than speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.390" offset="19988982">Picketing is conduct and that's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.920" offset="20019075">It's the conduct of the picketing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.171" offset="20032031">The 13 pickets marching for abreast, interfering with traffic and customers which gave occasion to the regulation among other factors, it was the presence of the pickets marching up and down which led this Court to its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.137" offset="20111966">The congestion, the hindrance of customers and the disruption of normal business, these were the considerations which resulted in a reasonable regulation with which we are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.122" offset="20159822">Now, the union says that all at once is to communicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.994" offset="20179362">If this is so, why would 13 pickets necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.136" offset="20199946">Wouldn't one picket with some wood signs on front and back have been sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="5278.128" offset="21215901">Now, in the past, this Court -- this Court has been reluctant to disturb state court's injunctions in this area except of course where there is total coefficient of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.281" offset="21284446">This Court stated that a State court's judgment is entitled to a waiting title of respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.656" offset="21317987">It is true that other states have balanced differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.305" offset="21344632">For example, California's public policy is set forth by a specific exclusion from its trespass statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.801" offset="21386533">As a result, California's public policy therefore is to permit labor union picketing within a shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.948" offset="21427179">Pennsylvania in a factual matrix of this case, through its judiciary declares conversely by affirming Pennsylvania, this Court does not upset California's public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.580" offset="21489664">These differences of public policy illustrate as this Court has recognized that states have different social and economic views and that each state must be free to determine its own views on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.897" offset="21558941">Of course, the injunction here as we see it was a narrow one and not enjoining all picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.157" offset="21587989">It merely regulated the picketing to a particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.586" offset="21609723">Thus, I submit, it accommodated all interest, the union's interest in communication with potential customers was preserved as they continue to picket at the berms, right at the point where the customers entered, Weis' property rights, whatever they were, were preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.044" offset="21711600">The public's right to trade without interference was maintained and the states right to maintain domestic peace was preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.399" offset="21752978">It is submitted that this was a reasonable and proper balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.253" offset="21776384">But the union now argues that Pennsylvania was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.310" offset="21808567">From arriving at this reasonable accommodation, although we have argued this question in our brief, we submit that this Court need not reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.242" offset="21856319">I might add that although the term sidewalk has been used here today and all other courts in this case have used the term porch, this is in fact a noncontiguous sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.724" offset="21926222">When the case arose, it was just this one store with Sears off to the side and a lot of construction going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.951" offset="21959137">This is not the type of sidewalk that one visualizes either on a public thoroughfare or within a possible shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.020" offset="21999470">This Court -- this porch didn't go anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.626" offset="22021831">Now, as to the question of waiver, we submit that preemption is a claim of violation of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.021" offset="22087450">This Court has refused to entertain such a claim unless first presented to the highest state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.346" offset="22124753">The law of Pennsylvania is that it will not consider a question not presented to it according to its rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="6321.860" offset="25390791">Our position in fact is that the picket's interference with the merchandising operations just outside the door is as much a disruption of picketing and this is much a disruption of business as it wouldn't happen if the picketing took place within the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.948" offset="25479189">It must be remembered Your Honors that our merchandising operation continued after the purchase of the merchandise have continued while the cars were driven up by the customers and the customers got out of the cars, the Weis employees left -- they didn't leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="6816.585" offset="27369723">In that court, what respondent sought they said, this is not a case in which the court has asked to prohibit defendant from picketing rather the plaintiffs request that the court control its location by directing that the picketing take place on the berm of the public thoroughfare and at the conclusion of its brief in the Court of Common Pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6842.309" offset="27472645">The berms of the public thoroughfares provide a more than adequate area from which the defendant can picket and or distribute handbills.</text>
            <text syncTime="6851.028" offset="27507440">They wanted us off the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.534" offset="27517471">Now, this is what we said in our brief in the Court of Common Pleas at page 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="6858.751" offset="27538369">Picketing should be allowed to continue near the Weis Market store area and the picket should not be restrained to picket only at the shopping center entrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.420" offset="27581001">The defendant union would be willing to negotiate with plaintiff Weis Markets as to the number of pickets to be utilized and the manner of such picketing near the Weis Market store area.</text>
