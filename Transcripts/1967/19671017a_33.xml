            <text syncTime="24.910" offset="203003">The principal question involved in this case is whether or not that a State Court decree conflicts with rights of coal miners, members of labor union and it holds that such labor union is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by employing an attorney on a salary basis to represent it’s members with respect to claims arising under the state’s Workmen’s Compensation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.104" offset="363813">The Bar Association of the State of Illinois filed a complaint in the Sangamon Circuit Court on behalf of it’s committee on unauthorized practice of law alleging that for many years District 12, United Mine Workers had been engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in that it involved an attorney, a duly licensed attorney, State of Illinois to represent its members on workmen’s compensation claims who were injured in the course of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.828" offset="530683">District 12 filed an answer admitting that it did employ such an attorney by stating that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States that it had a right to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.772" offset="598497">It denied that it had engaged at time in the unauthorized practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.424" offset="629112">The Court granted a sovereign decree in the Circuit Court in Sangamon County and joining the continuation of this legal aid claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.661" offset="669968">District 12, United Mine Workers appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois and this Court affirmed the decree of the Sangamon Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.817" offset="722631">The legal aid plan in question here was set up by a convention of District 12, United Mine Workers in 1913 at a convention held at Peoria, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.882" offset="786892">The convention consisted of delegates from the various local unions and various coal mines in the state of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.122" offset="823881">Now District 12 is a branch of United Mine Workers of America, a national labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.216" offset="856273">It's composed of some 14,000 members; 8,500 of these members are working members and some 5,500 are retired members.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.103" offset="911757">The legal aid plan in question here was set up as I say in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.832" offset="942686">It was set up because the delegates, the coal miners at the convention in their discussions said that the claims that they were filing in the state Courts with connection with their injuries were being mishandled.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.142" offset="1007992">I think the words juggled were used and that even the claims were not mishandled that it cost the injured employee approximately 50, from 40% to 50% of the rewards given and attorney fees and in cost to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.335" offset="5036701">Let me read what it said, just very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.496" offset="5049344">Here's what they condemn this legal aid plan for, you have the court's words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.180" offset="5068048">The lawyer is not paid for any services by the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.968" offset="5083199">His salary is paid by the association and because the interests of the employer and the client, the interest of the union collectively may extend beyond the interest of the injured member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.538" offset="5137533">Now, our answer to that Mr. Justice Brennan is just simply this, that the testimony here shows conclusively that a claim, when it comes up that the claimant himself makes the determination on whether that will be settled or whether that will go on to hearing and the awards is incomplete sole control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.691" offset="5226141">Now, there couldn't be any conflict between the union's interest and the man's interests, in the first place the interest came up for reason of these claims and the authorizations, the contract of employment, resolution setting up this department in 1913 specifically provides that this claimant is going to be in control of this lawsuit on what he wants to do of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.872" offset="5326869">And we think that the court's speculation here -- there's absolutely no evidence in this record but at anytime that there's been an abuse of this representation at all, that at any time there has been an abuse of this because of a conflict between the union's interest and the possible interests of the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.268" offset="5420492">And again for instance that in the future if this legal aid plan contend that first thing you know that they're getting people to get divorces for them and they would be doing this and doing that, well of course you can speculate almost anything but it's purely speculation, there's not a cental of evidence in this record that anything occurred here it wasn't to the satisfaction of these employees here, there's no complaints at all about their services, about the way their awards are settled to them and I am not saying this that in regard to that when they want this client to pay this legal fee, they're talking in terms here of this record was about five years in excess of $2 million and under the record here in the evidence, there would be at least 20% of that reward will go to the legal fees as such if it was with private lawyers together with the cause there and the Illinois Supreme Court conceded, it does a great benefit to these coal miner to arrange it independently.</text>

            <text syncTime="4238.617" offset="17057834">The railroad workers by recommending competent lawyers to each other obviously are not themselves engaging in the practice of law nor are they are the lawyers who may select parties to any soliciting events.</text>

            <text syncTime="4556.499" offset="18329370">In some states I know that the legislature in its concern for the welfare of the workers themselves limit very greatly the fees that can be charged in these compensation cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="4641.365" offset="18668857">They like to take great credit for it, but in getting that welfare fund every legal obstruction, there were other obstructions, but in the way of it, we feel that if this position taken the bar association in this instance prevails, that we'll have the same situation that developed and has existed in 1912 that led up to this situation and we think we've improved down here in situation.</text>
