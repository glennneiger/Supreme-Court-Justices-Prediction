            <label>Mr. Irwin A. Seibel</label>
            <text syncTime="23.712" offset="198196">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.502" offset="213347">These consolidated cases are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the judgment of that Court which reversed in Order of the Federal Maritime Commission issued under Section 15 of Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.019" offset="295476">The Order required two closely interrelated Trans-Atlantic steamship passenger conferences to modify certain provisions of their conference agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.812" offset="354617">The proceedings in which the Commission’s Order was entered were triggered by a complaint filed by the American Society of Travel Agents, the other petitioner in this case, complaining about certain practices of the conferences and requesting the Commission to undertake an investigation of the interrelationship between the travel agents and the conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.141" offset="483976">This was the first comprehensive investigation undertaken by the Commission of this relationship since the enactment of the Shipping Act in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.033" offset="535489">The two conferences here involved are informed distinct legal entities though they are closely coordinated and they determine the uniform practices and policies for their member lines including the fixing of transportation fares, the fixing of commissions paid to their travel agents and also the selection, supervision and control of the agents they appoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.987" offset="687313">One of the conferences is responsible for fixing the fares and the commissions for the travel agents and the other is responsible generally for picking the travel agents and seeing to it that they stay in line; that they observe the proper conference rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.518" offset="769442">Membership in each conference is identical or almost identical, each consisting of the same 25 lines with one unimportant exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.236" offset="820328">Seven of the lines do not serve the ports of the United States or at least very minimally.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.226" offset="856273">The conference lines carry 99%, 99% of all the Trans-Atlantic passengers going by ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.884" offset="910921">They obtain most of this traffic through the travel agents they appoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.801" offset="938611">Typically, these agents account for about 75% to 80% of all the tickets sold in the United States for Trans-Atlantic steamship passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.973" offset="995244">These agents almost always also serve as agents for airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.935" offset="1019068">After a full evidentiary hearing, the Commission’s examiner recommended disapproval of certain provisions and of certain practices of the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.147" offset="1071940">Among those disapproved was the so-called “tying-rule”.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.042" offset="1099525">This is a rule which forbids the travel agents under penalty of disqualification from serving any competing non-conference steamship line.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.025" offset="1167444">In other words, it ties the agents to the conference members.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.994" offset="1191372">The other rule, the “unanimity rule”, so-called is one the examiner did not recommend be disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.935" offset="1235153">This is a rule which requires the agreement of all the member lines, all 25 member lines before any change can be made in the level of commissions payable to the travel agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.033" offset="1539532">Now the travel agent, instead of recommending the disapproval of this so-called “unanimity rule” recommended only that the seven conference lines who do not serve the United States ports and therefore, derived little of any business from travel agents from the United States not be permitted to vote on the rates of commission payable to the travel agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.561" offset="1637648">The Commission with two Commissioners dissenting upheld the examiner’s disapproval of the tying-rule, rule which ties the agents to the member lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.394" offset="1680906">The Commission, however, disagreed with the examiner’s qualified acceptance of the unanimity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.075" offset="1711626">It held that the unanimity rule had prevented a majority of the conference lines from increasing the commission rates and as a consequence, put the conference lines at a disadvantage in competing with the airlines for the promotional assistance of the travel agents.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="irwin_a_seibel" startTime="427.057" stopTime="671.064">
            <label>Mr. Irwin A. Seibel</label>
            <text syncTime="427.057" offset="1811623">The examiner did not recommend disapproval of the unanimity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.824" offset="1834715">He recommended disapproval of the tying rule but not the unanimity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.432" offset="1853106">He said that he recommended that the seven lines, seven member lines who do not serve the United States ports not be permitted to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.903" offset="1895006">The Commission on the other hand disapproved both rules but did permit the seven lines to vote, indicating it had no objection to their having some voice in the voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.222" offset="1964283">It ordered the elimination of the rule indicating that once the veto power of the lines not serving the United States was eliminated, they could have some voice in the voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.643" offset="2021961">On review, the first time came before the Court of Appeals, the Court set aside the Order and remanded the matter to the Commission for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.180" offset="2072116">With respect to the tying rule, the Court held that the Commission had failed expressly to find that that rule offended one of the four criteria set forth on the statute, namely that, it was not on a fir or unjustly discriminatory as between carriers, detrimental of the commerce in the United States’ contrary of public interest or otherwise in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.208" offset="2184234">And, the Court also noted that the Commission had apparently rested it’s disapproval on the ground exclusively on antitrust principles and pointed out to the Commission that it must measure its disapproval against one of the four criteria set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.421" offset="2265004">With respect to the unanimity rule, the Court held that the Commission had not made a sufficient showing that it was the rule which contributed to the disadvantage of the conference members in competing with the airlines for the promotional assistance of the travel agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.840" offset="2350686">It also said that a mere showing that the wishes of the majority of the conference members had temporarily blocked or even permanently blocked the conference from acting, was not sufficient under the statute in its view to invalidate the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.587" offset="2437726">The Court then directed the Commission to either make adequately -- supported ultimate findings to justify disapproval or to approve the rule and no certiorari was sought from that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.957" offset="2491225">The Commission then considered the matter on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.163" offset="2508048">And on remand, the Commission reanalyzed the evidence and made extensive findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.049" offset="2543574">It fully set forth the rationale underlying its application of Section 15 of the Act to these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.682" offset="2582131">It recognized that the Section 15 was intended to condone some anticompetitive agreements, obviously, it granted an exemption once the agreements have been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.840" offset="2638764">But in the Commission’s view, the statute did not represent a total abandonment of the antitrust concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.566" offset="2669589">In its view, anticompetitive arrangements, which are more restrictive than necessary to serve some legitimate shipping act purpose; should not be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.305" offset="2728626">It then turned to a consideration of both of the rules and again, disapproved both expressly finding that both are detrimental to the commerce of the United States and contrary to the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.961" offset="5727169">However, the other ground for eliminating the rule was that, this rule existed in its most unabated form, that is that it didn’t have a definite time period in contrast to a rule in the airline industry, which had a definite period of time when the members of the industry had to reset their rates and if they couldn’t agree unanimously why each was free to set his own rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.867" offset="5918804">I should like to turn to a point raised by Mr. Justice Stewart earlier regarding the integrity of these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.826" offset="5986722">As one argument advanced by the conference is that these rules have been in conference agreements ever since the inception of the conference system back at the last quarter of the 19th century, even before the enactment of the Shipping Act and that the Commission had approved these rules many years ago and, therefore, it shouldn’t have disapproved the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.653" offset="6101974">Now, in this proceeding, I think the -- really the short answer is that the statutory language is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.347" offset="6132799">And if I may call Your Honors’ attention to it, it appears on page 3 of the government’s brief or the relevant language to which I am referring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.683" offset="6174072">In the first full paragraph at page 3 is a portion of Section 15, and I will skip the irrelevant portion as I read; the section that directs the Commission to disapprove any agreement and I skip to the fourth line, and read, “Whether or not previously approved by it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.412" offset="6285040">So the statute makes an amply clear that the Commission has the authority and indeed it must disapprove an agreement whether or not previously disapprove that it finds offense of one of the four statutory criteria and of course, the Commission did that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.211" offset="6544175">The fixing of rates, of course, the transportation fares is not at all in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.806" offset="6574582">I should like to say a word about the tying rule was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.693" offset="6594121">And what the rule comes down to is that, it’s an agreement among the conference lines that the agent, any agent of any member may not serve a competing non-conference line on penalty of being disqualified from serving all conference lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.743" offset="6694327">In other words, the rule is in effect an agreement to boycott any agent who doesn’t deal exclusively with the conference members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.674" offset="6738108">Now, the Commission found that since the conferences account for 99% of all business in this trade and these agents whom they’ve tied up this way sell about 80% of all the tickets, the restrictions inflicted injury on the three interests I had mentioned earlier, the independent non-conference trader, who, like the conference members, everybody agrees is highly dependent upon travel agents for business is denied access to these agents and generally, are the best established and most successful agents in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.925" offset="6919084">And, of course, demand the public in the hinder land who wants to go by with his family while on a non-conference vessel is likewise denied the services of a travel agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.242" offset="6976345">The travel agents were tied at the conference lines and, as I mentioned earlier, travel agents themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.608" offset="7005811">Those appointed by the conference members can’t sell tickets for clients who may want to go that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.542" offset="7049592">The commission -- what the conference says, well this is all conjecture; there was no evidence to show that this actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.873" offset="7110823">No conference carrier came up to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.210" offset="7120227">No member of the public was up as a witness and there really has not been any showing of a measurable loss by the travel agents of any business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.193" offset="7156172">But first, the short answer to this is that these injuries are just bound to occur given the fact that 80% of the business is run by the travel agents appointed by the conference members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.995" offset="7219388">And surely, the Commission wasn’t obliged to showing that this restriction was devastatingly effective and that no one could ever find a way of traveling by non-conference vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.844" offset="7278738">As a matter of fact, the record does show, if that were necessary, that agents have, the conference agents have had to turn away prospective customers for non-conference traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.894" offset="7326908">As a matter of fact, the chairman of the conference himself testified at pages 144 and 145 of the record that -- I’m paraphrasing that he’d been asked whether he’d been approached by a travel agent to sell or to allow the travel agent to sell tickets for a family who wanted to go on non-conference vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.327" offset="7440697">He said in substance, well, I am little hazy, I vaguely recall something like that but I’m sure if he had come to me, I would have said to him while I tell all the agents that nowhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.273" offset="9444498">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.611" offset="9461844">The petitioner in No. 258, the American Society of Travel Agents concurs in the views expressed by the United States government and at this time, we would like to add some additional points and answer some of the questions which Your Honors have raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.924" offset="9519104">In the light of the prospective we have acquired after a living with this case for more than ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.943" offset="9547107">First, let me identify as to the American Society of Travel Agents, it is the principle of the Trade Association of Independent Travel Agents in the United States and for anyone who has been unfortunate enough not to have the opportunity to avail themselves of the services of agents but we say that there are people who sell and promote travel of all kinds, Ocean, rail, air and bus, they create and sell tours; they get no payment generally by the public but rely for their livelihood on commissions paid by the carriers and by hotels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.115" offset="9715858">According to the survey made by the government in this case, in Exhibit “40”, they are generally small businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.672" offset="9746056">They are individual entrepreneurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.201" offset="9756191">They are not employees although the lines, the respondents here, regard them as their principal sales force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.146" offset="9783986">They are nevertheless forbidden by the National Labor laws to combine to act collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.916" offset="9811048">They are also forbidden by the antitrust laws to act collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.473" offset="9837275">We did bring this complaint as Mr. Seibel has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.800" offset="9854621">In 1958, very reluctantly before the Federal Maritime Board -- reluctantly because the agents have long had great loyalty to these lines -- they were agents for these lines long before the Wright Brothers began to experiment with air flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.677" offset="9926092">Nevertheless, after having heard for many years the old story that they have rules which dated back to 1879 and rules which prevented any change in their formed Act because they couldn’t unanimity, and after making every effort to persuade the lines, to change their rules and having failed and in post war period when the competition of airlines began to prove, that these carriers were heading for disaster and were too inflexible to change to adopt to the changing economic conditions asked about its complaint before the then Federal Maritime Board, which led to this investigation in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.503" offset="10101426">And as Mr. Seibel stated, it was the first investigation of how these respondents collectively treat travel agents and it was comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.400" offset="10144998">It led to a three-week hearing in New York City in 1961 to a report by the examiner in 1963 to a first Commission Order in 1964, a first Court of Appeals remand in 1965, a second Commission Order where we again had to a brief and argue the entire case and this time before a new member of the Commission and convince him to join with the majority and, finally, to the reversal by the Court of Appeals in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.329" offset="10280730">Now, the principal argument advanced by the respondents here in their brief is that there just isn’t enough evidence to sustain what the Commission did and this is getting to the point which Mr. Justice Fortas has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.652" offset="10337991">Well as noted in our Reply Brief, respondents are seeking to apply here a very rigid evidentiary standard, one which may be applicable to a situation in which an agency acts in a quasi-judicial function but which has no application to an agency in its regulatory function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.974" offset="10415313">In addition to the American Airline C.A.B. case, in the Court below which we cite in our Reply Brief and in which the distinction between the forms of agency action is very clearly spelled out, we note that this Court has spelled out its views on the subject of regulatory action by agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.403" offset="10492949">In the case of the Federal Communications Commission against Pottsville Broadcasting at 309 U.S. 134 in which it was held that it was improper for an appellate court to apply trial court standards to agency regulatory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.771" offset="10566405">And again in McClean Trucking cited in our Brief at page 25, this Court has held that it was proper for an agency to speculate as to future consequences and effects that it should make its judgment based on available present facts and on its past experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.177" offset="10644041">Well, the available present fact here were we submit sufficient despite a deliberate policy by respondents as found by everybody who has issued findings with respect to this case, a deliberate policy on their part to avoid governmental review, adapted and adopted out of fear of the American antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.929" offset="10723140">That was an uncontested finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.000" offset="10743411">Now, Mr. Justice Harlan asked a question earlier to Mr. Seibel with respect to the taking of additional evidence; and this also bears on the question raised by Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.746" offset="10798373">We believe that no additional evidence was needed and nobody ever asked for it because primarily there is no dispute in the agency even between the examiner and the Commission as to the underlying evidentiary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.681" offset="10858141">The examiner found that unanimity rule had blocked changes in commissions and he found that there had been detriment to the lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.230" offset="10888338">Where he different from the Commission was solely with respect to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.572" offset="10905684">He thought the remedy for this diversion by the agents was to pass a rule prohibiting diversion. We could call this a prohibition law and it would probably have had about as much a success as our national prohibition law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.009" offset="11187388">Well, the Court was wrong, Your Honor, in our view because it was applying a standard of review which this Court has subsequently held to be inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.227" offset="11236289">You mean that the Court was wrong in insisting on findings by the administrative agency?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Sisk</label>
            <text syncTime="2788.508" offset="11257396">No, the Court substituted its judgment for that of the agency with respect to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.660" offset="11277981">The Court said, we find the reasoning of the examiner more persuasive with respect to the remedy, the examiner having suggested that the remedy to be applied was to pass a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.906" offset="11323016">But this was one of the Court’s principal objections to the Commission’s Report and I point out to Your Honors, that the opinion written by the Court below was written by Judge George Washington, who wrote the opinion of the court below in Consolo against the Federal Maritime Commission which this Court reversed for applying an incorrect standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.972" offset="11419251">Consolo was reversed by this Court one year after the first Court of Appeals decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.120" offset="11447881">So that when the Court of Appeals in this case dealt with the issues before it, it was applying the wrong administrative standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.900" offset="11490931">Now, with respect to Your Honors’ question as to what findings there were, all of the people who have heard the evidence in this case, the examiner and the Commission found that the unanimity rule have blocked changes in commissions, found that agents were diverting travelers to the airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.294" offset="11564596">The sole issue was what to do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.822" offset="11582673">The examiner thought you prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.816" offset="11594585">The Commission thought the best way to deal with this is to let the lines be free to exercise their business judgment, unfettered by the veto power of the unanimity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.476" offset="11637321">In addition, the examiner had another remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.225" offset="11648293">He thought that you could disqualify the seven lines who do not serve United States ports from voting, disenfranchise them completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.020" offset="11683401">The Commission’s remedy was to let them have a vote but do away with their veto power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.333" offset="11704717">The Court of Appeals didn’t really quarrel with the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.846" offset="11718719">It said, “We find the reasoning of the examiner as to the remedy more persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.711" offset="11742229">This was a substitution of the Court’s judgment for that of a Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.614" offset="11761873">And we make this point historically because when it finally went from the Court of Appeals back to Commission, who wrote a very extensive and very learned opinion, the second time around, detailing all of the points on which it relied and it came back to the Court of appeals and I might say that respondents elected to bring the case even though they are located in New York and even though the case was tried in New York before hearing examined there under the Administrative Procedure Act, they had their choice of Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.497" offset="11893321">They elected to bring it before the Court of Appeals presumably because it was applying a pre-Consolo standard of review and they thought they had their best chance to success there and one can’t quarrel with an advocate for doing that but it was the wrong standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.123" offset="11979839">As I said, the Court below incorporated in its brief opinion, in the case which is before Your Honors today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.096" offset="12003767">Its earlier opinion saying that the doubts and problems they’ve pointed out in their earlier opinion prevent them from affirming the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.832" offset="12038666">But as I’ve indicated, since that opinion was based on a pre Consolo test, it was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.501" offset="12061341">And, moreover, it was error for the Court to reject the application of antitrust principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.508" offset="12089448">The proposition that antitrust principle should not be considered in a case of this nature, lies in the face of a line of cases in this Court beginning with McClean Trucking and running down through Silver against the New York Stock Exchange to as recently as Denver and Real Gram Western Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.889" offset="12158934">The tenor of those cases is that regulatory agencies must evaluate collective action and must weigh anticompetitive considerations and try to reconcile the competing statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.761" offset="12214418">And Silver against the New York Stock Exchange at page 364, this Court held that the exchange would be violating the antitrust laws “unless justified” by reference to the Securities and Exchange laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.405" offset="12277008">So the principle to call upon a proponent of an anticompetitive rule for justification has been accepted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.923" offset="12327058">Now we submit that the Maritime Commission applied no per se rule or test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.059" offset="12347643">We agree with the government that respondent simply failed to produce any evidence of need or any other justification whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.452" offset="12385155">We need not, I believe, belabor the importance of this principle to the regulation by government agencies generally in dealing with antitrust exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.973" offset="12435310">In our view, there can be no practical way to administer the Shipping Act or any other regulatory act if the agency cannot require the proponent of the rule, of the anticompetitive rule to demonstrate at least some justification, at least some need for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.289" offset="12808547">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.116" offset="12823803">Mr. Chief Justice, you put a question to Mr. Seibel, asking whether a majority of the lines supported the government’s position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.337" offset="12872704">I think Mr. Seibel interpreted that question to mean. was there a majority of lines way back 10 or 15 years ago in favor of an increase in commissions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.615" offset="12917844">I think he answered the question “yes” in that light but I’m not sure that there may not be some confusion here as to where the conference lines stand on the matters before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.152" offset="12975940">I am the spokesman here for all the lines who unanimously agreed that the Commission was wrong and the Court below was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.985" offset="13015333">In other words, we believe, our clients believe, that the two rules which have been struck down by the Commission here after some 40 years of approval strike at the foundation of the conferences themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.467" offset="13085236">We agree that over 40 years these conferences developed barnacles in connection with the supervision and control of agents and that there were great many improvements which the Commission ordered, as a result of this investigation, many of which the conference itself had recognized and it began to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.841" offset="13170709">And the Commission agrees here that all of this was done and that only matters litigated below, which were the focus of this entire inquiry was whether this unanimity rule and this conference tying rule were good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.256" offset="13240404">The Commission condemned them as bad and we say it condemned them essentially on antitrust principles, not on the basis of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.760" offset="13290454">And we say that on the first opinion below, the Court pointed that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.368" offset="13308844">As Mr. Justice Fortas had said, he told the agency, you have applied the incorrect standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.186" offset="13344162">And when it came back to the Court the second time, it came back upon the same record and we believe the Court below reversed the second time, to answer Mr. Justice Black’s question, because the Court treated the Commissions re-written report on remand as the tacit admission that on this record, the Commission could come up with nothing better and --</text>

            <text syncTime="5491.244" offset="22068328">But what I was about to say was, that the commission brushed aside the tying rule by saying to us, “You don’t have one in the Caribbean Cruise Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.200" offset="22108139">Well, the answer to that is, we don’t have a conference in the Caribbean Cruise trade and the reason we don’t have a conference in the Caribbean Cruise Trade is that it differs essentially in character from the Trans-Atlantic Passenger Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.005" offset="22167385">It wasn’t investigated but it’s common knowledge that steamships come and go in the cruise trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.542" offset="22193507">They commit themselves to no regularity and frequency of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.565" offset="22209599">They frequently cancel sailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.162" offset="22224018">They go where they make money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.531" offset="22233527">The conference is necessary because in it, a group of carriers agree that all year long, good season, bad season, they will maintain a regular service across the Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.741" offset="22294340">That means that while they can fill their ships in the summer months when it’s pleasant to travel, eight or nine months of the year, they must go over with more crew than they have passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.992" offset="22347316">So, it is essential to them to try to assure, just as the cargo vessels must assure, the loyalty of the merchants, if you can call them at upon -- on their patronage depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.745" offset="22414399">So the tying rule and it’s set forth that it’s not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.788" offset="22434565">It says you can’t do it without permission but they say the record shows it’s enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.550" offset="22461524">The tying rule ties these selected travel agents to the patronage of these lines all year long so the lines can try to fill their ships with these many passengers in four season as they can to be able to maintain the financial stability they need in order to provide the regularity of service, and frequency of service, and dependability which is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.847" offset="22562774">That’s point one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.310" offset="22568626">The other point is this; if you say a travel agent is no longer tied to the conference, what happens to the conference?</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.927" offset="22607078">Why should a line remain in a conference if it can get these agents without having to belong to the conference?</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.827" offset="22638634">And therefore, we get down into some fundamental philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.244" offset="22652322">We say that Congress recognized that conferences were justifiable, that they were desirable though they had abuses and needed regulation and that the only way they could effectively exist was to give them reasons why they should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="5837.223" offset="23452296">Congress, in the 1961 legislative debate over the dual rate law, pointed out that in most conferences the American flag lines represent a small minority.</text>

            <text syncTime="5860.228" offset="23544247">Now if you say or as the Commission does, that such matters is the rate of commission which is after all a financial matter that enters into the general financial picture of each line may be fixed by a dominant group majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.446" offset="23621151">You are up to leave the small minority American flag lines right out in the cold because the whole purpose of the unanimity rule on a matter of this sort is to see to it that each line has an effective participation in determining the area of competition on which it is willing to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.221" offset="23720208">It means, in other words, that if you say that rate of commission may be fixed by a so-called “majority” that smaller lines with less resources could be driven out of the trade because they could not meet the higher rate of commission that a more financially affluent line could afford to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.306" offset="23820622">And the whole idea of the conference, repugnant as it may sound to some, is to try to stabilize that rate of commission which all are willing to live with.</text>

            <text syncTime="6811.802" offset="27350601">I’m quoting now from the Senate document No.100, which is the index of the legislative history of the steamship conference dual rate law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.515" offset="27389471">It’s a convenient abiding which contains everything including the reports referred to in our Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.158" offset="27416012">But what I want to say is this; Congress was concerned with two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6833.138" offset="27435969">No. 1, if it was going to authorize or confirm that steamship conferences and the activities there under were to be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.917" offset="27479019">Those conferences must be able to be affected. They must have as it was put effective tying arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.510" offset="27513396">Secondly, if they were to be in the interest of the United States, there must be protection for the American flag minority which Congress pointed out with a high cost operators who couldn’t compete on a dollar for dollar basis with lower courts Europeans.</text>
            <text syncTime="6870.424" offset="27585076">And Senator Angel said, the reason that these antitrust amendments or proposals advanced by the Department of Justice were not adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6881.493" offset="27629380">He put it in rather colorful language.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.362" offset="27636799">He said, “We found it wholly impossible” - this is page 462 of the Book I just mentioned – “to authorize what amounted to a quasi monopoly or a semi-monopoly and then turn around and de-authorize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6900.413" offset="27705031">There was simply no way to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="6902.536" offset="27713494">In other words, to march up the hill and say they were lawful, and then march down again and adopt things that would make them unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6912.505" offset="27753409">And as I say, the tying rule of this passenger conference is precisely the effective kind of tying arrangement that is of importance in keeping this conference together as a conference and eliminating competition for travel agents on the wrong basis, namely; We will get your services because we pay you a much higher rate of commission not because we’re serving the public interest by better ships, better accommodations but because we’re willing to pay you more money”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.928" offset="27911084">Secondly, another concern as I mentioned was the question of protection of American flag minority, the unanimity rule is designed precisely to accomplish that and the proof of the putting there is this; the present Secretary of Transportation, when he was the chairman of the civil aeronautics board, pointed out that the unanimity rule currently in effect in IAAC, the International Association of Air Carriers, was insisted upon by the United States to protect the right of each individual carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="7023.055" offset="28195610">They were put on notice at the outset of what the issues were, they were well aware of the decision of the DC Circuit Court in -- his Branson case cited at Page 9 of our Brief in which the DC Circuit 1954 had said that, “Actions which invade the provisions of the antitrust laws more than our necessary should not be approved under the Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7050.272" offset="28304488">They were aware of it because hearing counsel had adopted a standard early in the case that called for justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="7057.855" offset="28334791">They attempted to prove, need or justification that put in evidence in an effort to support each of the arguments which Mr. Neaher has made here to Your Honors, this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="7170.477" offset="28785246">If it is accepted by the Courts, it will make regulation by the Maritime Commission absolutely impossible in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="7177.698" offset="28814190">Now, we do want to point out that not all the anticompetitive acts of respondents have been prohibited by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7184.286" offset="28840521">The Commission was very selective indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7186.066" offset="28847626">It picked the extreme anticompetitive measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="7189.207" offset="28860165">In the case of the unanimity rule, it’s a rule which goes far beyond just an ordinary price fixing but requires price fixing by 100% of the 25 members so that the price freeze stays in effect forever until they can get a 100% to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7204.629" offset="28921919">What the Commission did was to prohibit that, not to prohibit collective action.</text>
            <text syncTime="7209.242" offset="28940309">They can still take a collective action so that there will be no rate war, commission war among the lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7215.367" offset="28964864">They just are required to take that collective action by a somewhat more flexible voting rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="7223.891" offset="28998928">Mr. Neaher’s statutory construction is not borne out by the status itself which reads, “Before approval, all agreements shall be unlawful”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7232.820" offset="29034663">It’s only after they were approved that they obtain an antitrust exemption and there was nothing unusual about the standards applied by the Maritime Commission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7244.205" offset="29080221">The legislative history here refers to has to do with the dual rate legislation which was totally different from what’s involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7252.984" offset="29115329">As we read that legislation, and it did require affirmative legislation, we might point out in order to obtain such approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="7263.335" offset="29156707">That legislation never impaired the concepts which this Court laid down in the original Federal Maritime Board’s Branson case, which came before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7274.131" offset="29199862">It merely imposed a right to have dual rate contracts under very limited safeguards.</text>

            <text syncTime="7319.185" offset="29380106">The Court of Appeals has revealed this record and Universal Camera case was supposed to make that necessary to those Court (Inaudible).</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Sisk</label>
            <text syncTime="7337.697" offset="29454190">We believe that this Court does not have to re-evaluate the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7343.182" offset="29476133">This is not a question of evidence in this case but is a question of choice of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="7347.406" offset="29492955">That what the Court of Appeals did was to elect the remedy and substitute its judgment for that of the Commission and rather than apply the doctrine of that Universal Camera case, we suggest the doctrine of this Court in ConSolo against the Federal Maritime Commission as the controlling standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="7363.908" offset="29558993">However, if this Court is interested in the evidence, it is summarized in our Brief at great length at pages 37 to 49 where we detailed the evidence which supports the findings of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7375.391" offset="29604968">We do point out, for example, that the examiner in his opinion at page 421 of the record said that unanimity rule had blocked action by the sub-committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="7387.503" offset="29653347">That the sub-committee of the Atlantic Conference was the committee that initiated the action and that he did find that the record in this proceeding at page 431 establishes the fact that water carrier bookings have been retarded to a degree and air carrier bookings increase because agents have diverted traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="7406.274" offset="29728475">And even the dissents at page 572 of the record says, “there was no doubt in my mind” -- this is the Commission dissent of Commissioner Paterson – “there was no doubt in my mind”, he says at the bottom of 572, “that the unanimity and tying rules have prevented changes and have prevented certain ticket selling services.</text>
            <text syncTime="7427.688" offset="29814157">In answer to the question of substantial evidence, we refer Your Honors, in addition to those pages to our Brief at page 14 through 16 where we cite the new findings of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7441.151" offset="29867969">And, finally, we respectfully call the Court’s attention to the words that Mr. Justice Black in the first Chenery case at 318 U.S. 99 where he said, “A judicial requirement of circumstantially detailed findings as the price of Court approval can bog the administrative power in a quagmire of minutiae” Hyper critical exactions as to findings can provide a handy but an almost invisible glide way, enabling Courts to pass from a narrow confines of law into a more spacious domain of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7475.670" offset="30006000">We submit that that is what happened to the court of Appeals in this case that it chose to make policy instead of leaving back to the Federal Maritime Commission, the body entrusted with that task by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7489.402" offset="30060962">Thank you.</text>
