            <label>Mr. David R. Normann</label>
            <text syncTime="21.931" offset="191091">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.366" offset="200808">Subsequent to yesterday's adjournment, I realized that while in our case and in the previous case, we have been discussing Article 2315 of the Louisiana Civil Code which is our Tort Law and provides for our wrongful death statute that we had not as yet read it to the Court and I think it might be helpful, it's not very long, if I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.024" offset="303417">It provides as follows; every act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.645" offset="345945">The right to recover damages to property caused by an offense or quasi-offense is a property right which on the death of the obligees inherited by his legal instituted or irregular as subject to the community rights of the surviving spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.541" offset="413550">The right to recover all other damages caused by an offense or quasi-offense, if the injured person dies, shall survive for a period of one year from the death of the deceased in favor of one, the surviving spouse and child or children of the deceased or either such spouse or such child or children; Two, the surviving father and mother of the deceased or either of them if he left no spouse or child surviving; And three, the surviving brothers and sisters of the deceased or any of them if he left no spouse child or parents survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.772" offset="570493">The survivors in whose favor this right of action survives may also recover for damages which they sustained through the wrongful death of the deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.948" offset="607169">A right to recover damages under the provisions of this paragraph is a property right which on the death of the survivor in whose favor the right of action survive is inherited by his legal instituted or irregular as whether suit has been instituted thereon by the survivor or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.416" offset="669027">As used in this Article, the words “child, brother, sister, father, and mother” include a child, brother, sister, father and mother by adoption respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.192" offset="720123">As I say, that is the basis for all Louisiana Tort Law as well as our wrongful death statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.894" offset="762964">I feel satisfied that the Court recognizes that this case does not in any way involved the racial issue notwithstanding the fact that it was mentioned in my opponent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.213" offset="832240">Consequently, it seems that the question with which the Court is presented is this, has Louisiana in classifying legitimates and illegitimates acted reasonably and in accord with the -- a legitimate purpose of its statutes so as not to offend the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.146" offset="943940">First, I submit of course that we have acted reasonably for these four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.989" offset="971316">One, Louisiana has exercised its legal right to legislate in areas which affect the health, morals and general welfare of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.915" offset="1007052">Two, most certainly the state has an interest in maintaining the sanctity of legitimate relationships as produced through lawful marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.862" offset="1046862">Third, Louisiana exercises its right to legislate so as to preserve the family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.509" offset="1069432">And fourth, Louisiana has enacted specific and very liberal legislation to permit the legitimation of illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.951" offset="1107153">Thereby conferring on them all rights enjoyed by legitimates.Discussing this briefly in the order mentioned that is first, the right to legislate in areas affecting health, morals and general welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.190" offset="1176116">This Court has recognized in sanction the right of a state to enact such laws including the right to legislate of the area of sexual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.240" offset="1208299">It was so stated in McLaughlin versus State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.727" offset="1222301">The Federal Government in all of the states had exercised a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.169" offset="1240064">Hence, the Department of Public Welfare of United States Government and the ordinance is the smallest township regulating and seeking to control such things as tuberculosis, venereal decease.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.198" offset="1284159">All operate in the same area and all of these we submit are entirely constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.886" offset="1310908">The criminal statutes punishing illicit and unnatural sexual conduct are also proper examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.450" offset="1341210">The sanctity of maintaining legitimate relationships through lawful marriage while bearing from State to State, every State in the union exercises his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.232" offset="1380289">And I don't believe anyone would seriously question the right or indeed the duty of the State to do so.Legislation designed to preserve a family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.062" offset="1419577">Perhaps this Court's holding in the case of Murphy versus Ramsey, states it most delinquently.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.951" offset="1455208">The Court held certainly no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and necessary in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth, and that would seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family has consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy state of matrimony, the sure foundation of all that it is stable and noble in our civilization; and finally, the legislation by the State of Louisiana to allow the legitimation of illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.851" offset="1582791">Here, we respectfully submit Louisiana has gone quite far and perhaps has excelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.918" offset="1607032">The history of our state's law has been one of constinent -- constant broadening of this concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.850" offset="1630751">Thus, Article 198 of our Civil Code provides children born out of marriage except those who are born from his ancestors' connection are legitimated by the subsequent marriage of the father and mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.652" offset="1677981">Whenever the latter have formally or informally acknowledge them for their children either before or after the marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.288" offset="1704521">As I mentioned yesterday by 1948 Amendment, this Article includes adulterous bastards.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.724" offset="1734301">Article 200 of our Civil Code, provides an unnatural father or mother may legitimate his or her natural children by a Notarial Act signed by two witnesses declaring the intention of a parent to legitimate such child or children.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.858" offset="1882781">The Louisiana doctrine of forced heirship I believe was explained to the Court.</text>
