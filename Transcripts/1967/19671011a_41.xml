            <label>Mr. Edward Brodsky</label>
            <text syncTime="9.543" offset="141563">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.679" offset="150131">Petitioner is a Certified Public Accountant who was convicted in the court below of giving money to Internal Revenue Service agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.513" offset="189419">He was named in 24 counts of an indictment for 12 separate transactions with respect to each transaction there were two separate counts in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.019" offset="239470">The Court of Appeals reversed three of the counts of the indictments so there were 21 counts remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.909" offset="271026">The evidence very briefly consisted of testimony from seven Internal Revenue Service agents who testified generally that they received money from the petitioner in connection with their audit of various tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.495" offset="345318">The amount of money that they received varied from a low of $25.00 according to them to a high of $75.00 most of the payments were $50.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.863" offset="390875">With that very brief statement of the facts, because we’re not complaining that the evidence in the trial court was insufficient, I will go immediately to my first point which is that the evidence before the grand jury in this case was insufficient to support the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.425" offset="473109">Now the entire evidence before the grand jury in this case consisted according to the government’s characterization of an Internal Revenue Service agent’s brief summary of portions of affidavits relating to the alleged illegal payments made by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.329" offset="572688">The man who testified before the grand jury, I don’t know who he was, but from the record in this case he could not have had any personal knowledge about more than just a few of these affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.964" offset="631202">In other words, the government puts a man before the grand jury who has no personal knowledge of most, if not all, of these pieces of paper that he’s summarizing, and then he briefly summarizes this hearsay, and that is the entire testimony to support this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.455" offset="725243">Now the grand jury testimony itself is not a part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.599" offset="741752">I know what it was because the government stated what it was in its brief in the Court of Appeals and the Solicitor General agrees that this is what the grand jury testimony was.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.038" offset="791489">Now, I am arguing here that that evidence was insufficient on alternative grounds, either under petitioner’s Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury, I think that right includes some kind of substance behind the grand jury indictment, or if this case does not reach constitutional dimensions then I would ask this Court under its rule making power to so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.195" offset="908204">Now it seems to me that I have two hurdles to overcome in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.936" offset="931088">First, I must convince the Court that there should be some kind of a standard of evidence in these grand jury situations, a standard of evidence which is enforceable by this Court and by other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.656" offset="990020">Second, once I get beyond that hurdle, the question becomes what should that standard of evidence be.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.367" offset="1020844">Addressing myself to the first question, I think that the analysis can be made in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.618" offset="1057834">Surely, I would think that everyone would agree that if an indictment is based upon no evidence, if for an example the prosecutor walks into the grand jury and says “Ladies and gentlemen, John Doe committed a crime, return an indictment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="254.905" offset="1123035">And it does inconceivably it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.940" offset="1135156">I think that all would agree that such an indictment would not be supported by this or any other court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Brodsky</label>
            <text syncTime="305.019" offset="1323447">There’s no decision after Costello which would sustain what I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.688" offset="1342151">And I think to be perfectly frank that what I’m asking this Court to do is not to overrule Costello because I think this case is far distinguishable from Costello, but at least to change some of the broad sweeping language in Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.290" offset="1408502">Costello says that if an indictment is valid on its face, and if it was returned by a legally constituted grand jury that’s enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.020" offset="1447476">And I’m saying that that is not enough under many circumstances and particularly under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.724" offset="1482271">And I think that what’s happened since Costello, I cite a number of cases in my brief where this has happened, is that prosecutors had been reading Costello in its broadest sense and have been returning indictments based upon less and less evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.839" offset="1566699">And I think that, and I charge in my brief, that one of the reasons that they’re doing this is because when they don’t put a person with personal knowledge before the grand jury then they don’t create another record by a person who is going to testify a trial, a record which would have to be turned over to defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.097" offset="1651754">So that prosecutors are motivated to get further and further away from presenting to grand juries any evidence which is based upon personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.586" offset="1697729">And the further away from that which you get, the closer you get to a situation of no evidence at all, and I think --</text>

            <text syncTime="451.941" offset="1911097">I think what the government avoids here if they would’ve had these same witnesses testify before this grand jury, we would’ve had not only their Jencks Act statements, these affidavits that were summarized, but in addition their grand jury testimony which might have been inconsistent with their Jencks Act statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.656" offset="2082043">I doubt that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.740" offset="2094373">These very same persons testified before a previous grand jury in this case and six out of seven of them, when they were asked in substance to name the persons from whom they received money, failed to mention petitioner’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.881" offset="2170859">They did, when the prosecutor said “Are there other people from whom you have taken money whose names you don’t remember?”</text>
            <text syncTime="522.759" offset="2194369">They said “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="523.653" offset="2198026">But when they were asked this specific question “Tell me the names of those persons from whom you received money,” six out of seven failed to mention petitioner’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.267" offset="2244420">Now when they come to get an indictment against petitioner, instead of using the same grand jury which knew about these prior, what I would call inconsistent statements, they go to a new grand jury and they don’t tell the new grand jury that these people have previously testified and failed to mention petitioner’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.237" offset="2328325">They merely have an agent who is isolated, from firsthand testimony, summarize these affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.010" offset="2359463">And I think that’s very far away from any kind of substantive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.146" offset="2383914">I should say also that the scope of this problem is indicated by a letter which is annexed to the government’s brief, a letter from the United States attorney for the southern district of New York to the Solicitor General, where the United States attorney says, in answer to my charge that in most cases, indictments are being returned on less and less evidence, he says himself that his policy has been up until this very case in the, and this is his language, in the so called cut and dried cases to have an agent summarize his interviews or his investigations of the case, mostly his interviews in the cases the way the United States attorney puts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.997" offset="2575339">So that we have a situation where the United States attorneys throughout the country, unless the law is changed, unless this Court says something about it to make a change, the United States attorneys in this country have the discretion now to present second or third or fifth or sixth hand evidence to grand juries.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.114" offset="2759868">Now assuming for a moment that, and I might say this before I get to the next point, that if the kind of evidence in this case is upheld by this Court and this indictment is sustained, then this is an effect a notification to the United States attorneys across the country that this kind of flimsy evidence at least will be sustained and there’s no reason, there’s no motivation on their part to present any stronger evidence, and as far as the grand jury is concerned as a practical matter, when a prosecutor says to the grand jury after summarizing affidavits, well if the grand jury does say “Shouldn’t we have something more?”</text>
            <text syncTime="707.615" offset="2933844">When he says to the grand jury “Well you know the Supreme Court of the United States has sustained this procedure,” that I believe would be sufficient for most grand jurors not to probe any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.363" offset="2976789">Now assuming for a moment that I’m over the first hurdle and that or might that there should be some kind of a standard that I get to the next question which is what should that standard be.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.968" offset="3027257">And I’m arguing that at least for purposes of this case, the standard of evidence before the grand jury should at the very least be the same standard of evidence as one needs to get a search warrant or an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.328" offset="3084727">It seems to me to be anomalous that you can indict a person on something less than you can arrest a person on.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.928" offset="3123075">After all the consequences of an indictment, the humiliation to say nothing of the expense of going through a complicated or even a non-complicated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.055" offset="3171558">A much more severe when a person is indicted then when he’s arrested yet as this very case shows a person can be indicted on substantially less evidence than a person can be arrested.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.920" offset="5603035">After the direct testimony of the witnesses, they were, counsel asked the government to produce all of the statements of the witnesses which came within the Jencks statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.491" offset="5665311">Now there are a large number of statements which were not furnished to us, which were sealed in the court below, sent up to the Court of Appeals and I understand that they are still sealed and now they are lodged with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.293" offset="5724557">Now the Court of Appeals and the government in its brief in the Court of Appeals tells us that these statements are statements by these witnesses who testified at trial in which they admit the receipt of money from other people, not from petitioner, and therefore the government has said that does not relate to their direct testimony since they didn’t testify about other people on direct testimony and that therefore the statements do not fall within the Jencks statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.659" offset="5870007">I want to put the Jencks Act in what I think it’s it proper context before I argue how these statements do indeed relate to the direct testimony. I’d like to talk about the Jencks Act in terms of the Rosenberg case in this Court in which this Court said that Jencks should be interpreted in the light of its purpose which is to provide defense counsel with material which might be useful for impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.456" offset="5993200">So trying to answer that question, was this material useful for impeachment purposes, of course I haven’t seen it, but knowing what it is from the statement in the -- by the Court of Appeals, I think that it was indeed valuable for impeachment purposes in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.032" offset="6075538">The witnesses apparently gave a lot of affidavits to the government in which they fail to mention petitioner’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.552" offset="6109602">Now I think that it would have been extremely useful for us at trial to be able to show that, for example, on January 1, on January 15, on January 20, and that’s the way it is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.373" offset="6160906">I’m referring to dates with respect to one of the particular witnesses, on each of those dates, the witness filled out an affidavit in which he purported to name, the names of those people from whom he received money and he failed to mention petitioner’s name on each of those dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.646" offset="6237915">And it wasn’t until for example April 17 in the particular case that I’m talking about, that he first mentioned petitioner’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.491" offset="6273337">Now I think that would’ve been extremely useful for cross examination purposes and we were denied that in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.005" offset="6311372">In addition, I think that there was another value for impeachment purposes here and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.265" offset="6340420">In the statements, the witnesses admitted taking money from other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.957" offset="6371244">They admitted in effect crimes involving moral turpitude, and I think that on cross-examination, it would’ve been useful and valuable for impeachment purposes to be able to show each specific crime that these witnesses admitted in the affidavits which were denied to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.351" offset="6452746">Now the government claims with regard to this point that we did on cross-examination asked these witnesses whether or not they received money from other people aside from petitioner, and indeed we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.163" offset="6504051">But the record shows that in answer to our questions on cross-examination, the witnesses were somewhat vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.392" offset="6536965">They said “Well, yes I took money, but I don’t remember how many people that I took money from or the years or the amounts” and yet when they were filling out these affidavits in the privacy of their rooms with the government officials, they were quite precise I am sure these affidavits will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.468" offset="6609272">They were quite precise in saying “On July 5, 1965, I took $25.00 from John Doe” and I think that these statements would’ve been extremely useful for impeachment purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.317" offset="7048652">The seven Internal Revenue employees involved who are witnesses in the case, six were indicted along with petitioner and the seventh was indicted in a separate indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.914" offset="7107062">So these seven witnesses were in a sense different than the normal witness you have in a normal situation, in a normal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.270" offset="7164426">Now, what happened is, they -- each of these witnesses testified on direct examination that they accepted bribes from petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.759" offset="7222418">Their direct examination was only concerned with their transactions with petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.013" offset="7259408">They didn’t, in their direct examination -- they didn’t go into any other bribes with any other accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.748" offset="7306324">After the direct examine -- after the first witness testified on direct examination, petitioner made a blank at the man for all statements made by the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.195" offset="7356165">After this blank at the man, the government turned over statements, affidavits of the witnesses and some of the affidavits were turned over directly to defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.407" offset="7432965">Other affidavits, the government told the court that had matters in them which did not relate to the direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.381" offset="7464939">So the court examined those affidavits in-camera, and as result of its examination what was actually turned over the government, the government had prepared it in advance were affidavits with certain portions excised -- would have -- with certain portions of it with material excised from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.878" offset="7554905">And what wasn’t turned over were statements concerning the petitioner’s transactions with other accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.975" offset="7591267">Now each of the -- included in the material turned over were grand jury testimony of these witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.633" offset="7633899">These witnesses, each of these witnesses had testified before a previous grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.762" offset="7662425">This was in the initial stage of investigation which involved widespread corruption in the New York Internal Revenue office and at this previous, in the initial stage before this first grand jury, only one of the witnesses had named petitioner as a person who had paid him bribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.644" offset="7761899">The testimony before the previous grand jury however somewhat the -- the previous grand jury didn’t try to develop all the names of all of the accountants who had received bribes from petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.597" offset="7829713">Now, at the conclusion of the case, defendant -- as each witness testified, found out that none of these witnesses had testified before the grand jury which had indicted petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.147" offset="7891989">At the conclusion of the case, he moved the court to dismiss the indictment on the ground that none of the witnesses had testified before the grand jury and asked the court to examine the grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.185" offset="7944129">At this point the court overruled his motion to dismiss and refused to examine the grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.033" offset="7975476">As I read the record, at no time did petitioner ask to have this grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.209" offset="8004211">The grand jury testimony involved in this case turned over to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.877" offset="8026885">Now his first contention is that Costello versus United States should either be reexamined or overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.774" offset="8078503">We see nothing in this case to warrant the reexamination or overruling Costello.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.033" offset="10819480">Let me get to the second issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.068" offset="10835675">The Jencks Act or Statute provides that after a witness testifies on direct examination, upon motion of the defendant, the government shall turn over all statements of the witness which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.118" offset="10915819">And if material doesn’t relate to the subject matter, the court shall examine the statement in-camera and shall excise the portion of the statements which do not relate to the subject matter of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.565" offset="10957615">Now in this particular case, the court, the trial judge we believe did turn over the material which should have been turned over and the material which was not turned over was properly kept from the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.929" offset="11067120">Now the trial judge in determining what related in this to the subject matter upon which the witness has testified didn’t adopt any narrow rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.532" offset="11121455">He gave them -- the defense got the affidavits which concerned the activities to which witnesses testified on direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.768" offset="11178402">In addition, the defense obtained earlier grand jury testimony of the witnesses even though only one of the witnesses as mentioned petitioner, and even as to the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.251" offset="11260426">Even statements which didn’t mention petitioner in two instances were turned over to petitioner and these statements mentioned acts of other accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.650" offset="11318000">The full record and not just the printed appendix in this case shows the basis upon which the court -- initially the grand jury testimony of the third witness, a former employee named Diche (ph) was not turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.361" offset="11392815">The court after reading the exhibit noticed a question in this grand jury’s act testimony which said “Did anybody else give you any money?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.301" offset="11444537">And the witness at that time didn’t name Umans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.702" offset="11462196">The court said “This material should be turned over.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.846" offset="11474735">And what the court says “At least the defendant could argue that at that particular time in the grand jury, the witness either did not remember or could not remember or did not want to remember Umans’ name.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.201" offset="11532204">So we have a situation where what the court was trying to do was, was trying to turn over -- is turning over any material which related to Umans while at the same time protecting from disclosure a material which related to other accountants individuals who hadn’t been -- who had been indicted and which were -- and who were awaiting trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.116" offset="11655816">Now the issue thus, is whether this peripheral matter has to be turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.992" offset="11695313">We submit that this is an area in which the court has discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.475" offset="11713285">In other words, the court has discretion at trial to cut off all examination as to other acts of bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.438" offset="11757171">The court doesn’t have to allow a defense counsel to get into the -- to allow him to cross-examine upon -- and try to impeach a witness with other acts of misconduct not amounting to criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.570" offset="11845674">But here the court, the court did allow this -- did allow these witnesses to be examined concerning these other bribes, but what the court didn’t turn over and properly didn’t turn over was the particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.311" offset="11928639">In other words, he didn’t turn over the defense's statements which said that on a particular day involving a particular tax return, the particular accountant who may have been awaiting trial on a separate indictment paid the agent a particular sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.650" offset="12021948">We don’t think that -- we think the Jencks Act -- this is a type of a material which the Jencks Act meant to keep confidential, especially since it involves what we say is needless disclosure of other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.727" offset="12094255">Petitioner’s cross-examination wasn’t hampered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.159" offset="12103973">He was allowed to question each of the witnesses as to the various amounts of money they received from other people.</text>
