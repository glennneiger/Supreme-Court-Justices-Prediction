            <text syncTime="27.765" offset="214392">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.582" offset="225677">The facts in these two cases are relatively simple and are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.285" offset="244485">In both cases, the prisoners are State prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.553" offset="257546">In both cases they are not attacking the sentences which they are now serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.337" offset="276668">In both cases they are attacking sentences to be served in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.220" offset="292237">In both cases the petitions presented prima facie cases upon which they would be entitled to a hearing if they we're serving the sentence of which they complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.878" offset="330898">We contend however, that the decision of the United States Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit, in these cases is incorrect and wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.816" offset="362663">Because the Fourth Circuit held “That a prisoner -- a state prisoner in a federal court is entitled to attack a sentence to be served in the future” Now less there be no confusion about our position in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.759" offset="418356">We agree wholeheartedly with the tenure and spirit of the decision but we object to it on a legal -- purely legal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.869" offset="458898">For a little history of the matter, I would call the Court's attention to the fact, as stated in our briefing that two years ago, Governor Godwin asked the Virginia Advisor for Legislative Counsel, which is composed of members of our general assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.249" offset="512397">To study the problems that tenant to the ever increasing number of Habeas corpus cases being filed and to try come up with some suggested statutory amendments to help us -- help the courts in handling this increase load.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.842" offset="574777">I served as a member of the subcommittee and of acting committee of the VALC and connect with the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.238" offset="608319">And prior to the argument in Rowe and Thacker in the Fourth Circuit, the VALC had already decided to recommend a legislation which was subsequently passed by this session of the general assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.455" offset="665161">And although it has not yet been signed into law, I have every reason to believe that it will in due course in a manner prescribed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.774" offset="694418">And in the appendix to our reply brief, you will find at the provisions of 8-596 of the Code of Virginia, is now amended which will go into effect on the first moment of June 28 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.957" offset="743215">Now provide specifically “That a prisoner may attack a sentence in the câmara of the Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.818" offset="766621">A State prisoner may attack a sentence to be served in the future even though he is not attacking the validity of present detention.”</text>
            <text syncTime="173.958" offset="799222">So the Virginia General Assembly has seen to—had has felt that the Rowe and Thacker rule is appropriate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Reno S. Harp, III</label>
            <text syncTime="228.799" offset="1018546">Now we agree with the spirit of it because we think quite candidly, that it protects the rights of the general public as well as that of the prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.729" offset="1058252">For as time passes, minds grow dim.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.289" offset="1072567">And it becomes increasingly difficult for an attorney to explain ten years after he tried a case how he tried it.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.223" offset="1096286">We hope to alleviate this situation by some other legislation which provides that after 28 June, in all criminal cases wherein the accused is sentenced to serve a period of five years or more in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.043" offset="1147591">Original two copies of the transcript will be forthwith prepared and filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.100" offset="1163786">I think the court has made a little crowd of that after while but we will have available records.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.547" offset="1185520">Our disagreement with the Fourth Circuit's decision therefore is not with the spirit of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.757" offset="1206418">Our disagreement with it is that the applicable provisions of the Federal Code particularly 28 USC, 22-54 and 22-41 repeatedly used the words “in custody”, and as Ms.Sollof just remarked a moment ago in the previous case, Congress has recently amended one of those sections and repeated those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.409" offset="1309027">This Court in McNally and in subsequent cases as late as Fay against Noia has upheld the doctrine that a prisoner must be in custody to attack the sentence of which he complains.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.877" offset="1350928">Now I'm familiar with the case of Jones against Cunningham where this Court decided that a prisoner could attack a sentence even though he was parole, I'm very familiar with—I lost it in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.822" offset="1402650">But I don't think that the reasoning there is incorrect nor would have be applicable here; where the prisoner is not being detained pursuant to these convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.234" offset="1444342">Now there mentioned made in the brief file on behalf of the prisoners by our learned counsel that the classification system puts him in custody because all these matters are considered; all these sentences are considered, whether that it goes on an honor in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.955" offset="1519156">Well as a matter of fact there aren't any honor farms in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.627" offset="1533889">There is no evidence in the record to support the suppositions, and it supposed any conclusions set forth in the brief filed herein with reference to that angle of the case and we submit that there without any merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.581" offset="1597733">Now, one other matter is raised --</text>

            <text syncTime="394.303" offset="1680593">And that where a person is incarcerated will depend at least partly upon how many offenses he has been convicted of.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.460" offset="3885223">The essential illegality I think Mr. Justice Brennan alleged in both cases is ineffective as representation of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.248" offset="3920332">I think that is the essential allegation and that is conceded by the state and found by the Fourth Circuit prima facie on their allegations to entitle them to a hearing if a hearing is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.903" offset="3986996">I think it's some important to point out the substantial areas of agreement between the respondent, petitioners and the state and to reemphasize what is the Assistant Attorney General has stated today.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.590" offset="4037778">That is we all agree that they are entitled to a hearing if the hearing is available; that they've alleged serious defects in the process by which they were tried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.497" offset="4085321">We also agree that the claims can be heard and adjudicated most effectively now, today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.351" offset="4116773">Not in 1993 or 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.314" offset="4132655">Its -- I think that both cases would require a substantial testimony by witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.080" offset="4163688">In Mr. Rowe's case, he alleges in that case that his lawyer told him that he should plead guilty to a charge of abduction of a female with intend to defile in neighboring city of Stanton because even though it already been convicted in the city of Waynesboro for rape in the same incident and sentenced to 30 years, than any sentence imposed upon him in the neighboring city would have to run concurrent with that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.496" offset="4281344">So I think that in order to prove—this was just a clear mistake when the Virginia law and judge made quite clear by imposing the 20-year sentence and ordering that they run consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.788" offset="4330559">I think that this clearly involved a necessity of calling witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.246" offset="4352397">I think in the case of Clyde Thacker, the evidentiary problems are even greater, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.838" offset="4374758">Because their this man was tried for house breaking that were allegedly committed 1951, ‘52 and '53.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.605" offset="4421778">He was already in custody at the time of his trial on other convictions and he alleges that when he was removed from his present place of incarceration and brought to this county, that the lawyer there who was appointed for when the day of his trial said “Don't worry, I can get the sentences suspended.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.060" offset="4503594">Which in fact the lawyer did and let's not put to state to a trouble and of a great expense of trial because you're going to be in jail for a long time anyway, and this sentences will just run or be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.634" offset="4561899">And the judge in fact did impose three to five year sentences to run consecutively and suspended them on the condition of good behavior for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.940" offset="4603173">The sentences were revoked in 1956 upon his reconviction for another crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.425" offset="4945063">I'd reach the point in the argument where I wish to describe what responds conceive to be the area of disagreement between the prisoner respondents in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.419" offset="4997099">That area of disagreement apparently is this and this only, and that is the state takes a position that McNally versus Hill is a correct statement of the availability of the writ of habeas corpus, historically and is extended to prisoners by Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.892" offset="5090931">The respondents, the prisoners take the position the McNally versus Hill was an incorrect statement and of the meaning of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.751" offset="5138369">That the writ was broader in this historically and that Congress did not limit the writ in any of its enactment, and that includes the Habeas Corpus Act of 1966 which I will avert in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.042" offset="5203571">I also would like to address myself in a few moments to the proposition that there is no reason why this case should be vacated and remanded simply because the State of Virginia has agreed to provide a state remedy after June that is presuming that the governor signs the Bill into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.882" offset="5290924">I think that there are at least three substantial reasons why the habeas corpus statutes should be interpreted in this context more broadly that they we're interpreted in McNally versus Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.508" offset="5353409">Again, the state agrees with the prisoners as to one these reasons at least; and that is that if they're going to have to the full unfair fact hearing, granted them in a federal court, granted them by Townsend versus Sane if they have not had a full unfair fact hearing in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.479" offset="5437315">It must be now, not a quarter of a century from now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.560" offset="5457586">Secondly, and I think this point is clear, that these men will be in custody will be in iron custody in the Virginia State Penitentiary for the quarter of a century between now and the time under McNally they're eligible to attack this allegedly unconstitutional convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.675" offset="5546088">If in 1994 they can still prove their claim, which I think is highly doubtful, but if they can still prove their claim, our experience tells that's it goig to take quite a bit of time to get through the state courts and if necessary through the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.434" offset="5617142">So because of a rule of timing, these men who perhaps are incarcerated constitutionally until 1994 will have to remain in the penitentiary, pending their application for writ of habeas corpus, pending a decision on whether or not to grant them that writ; so unnecessary time will be spent in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.356" offset="5708779">I think we always regret time that has to be spent in prison under an invalid sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.271" offset="5736469">Most often we can not correct, that's just unnecessary part of our judicial system is it operates now in granting post-conviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.901" offset="5770951">But in this case, it can be corrected if the rule of timing in McNally is not followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.234" offset="5904280">First of all, the Bill is not long now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.341" offset="5916714">Secondly, it was conceitedly not law at the time these prisoners entered the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.597" offset="6153801">But the point still remains that the question is exhaustion, and that these prisoners exhausted prior to entering the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.229" offset="6300296">So as of April 28, realistically is merely which court this hearing is going to be held.And finally, that does not completely knockout the 1994 argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.128" offset="6367901">You honor I think the no -- answer is no to both questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.535" offset="6385560">In the first place, the Virginia remedy would not become available until June 28 no matter when it is signed by the governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.669" offset="6414085">In the second place, even assuming that this Court's decision came at precisely the same time, the question presented here is the existence of a federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.091" offset="6455777">Now as to at least one of these prisoners, Clyde Thacker, it was highly questionable that even if the Virginia statute is inactive and does go into effect prior to this Court's decision whether he will have an adequate remedy in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.920" offset="6519097">For this reason Your Honors, Virginia has refused to follow the rule in the Fourth Circuit that when a man alleges and his counsel was appointed on or before—shortly before the day of his trial, that he has the burden—the Fourth Circuit has held the state when he proves that has burden approving that he wasn't prejudiced by this manifest defect in the state process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.893" offset="6614915">Where the State of Virginia says and consistently maintained despite reason Fourth Circuit decisions dealing with Virginia prisoners that the burden of proof is upon the prisoner so that Thacker could make a good case and even if you were just entering the federal courts for the first time in June, that he shouldn't have to exhaust the state remedy because there isn't any available remedy even under the new timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.627" offset="6721912">So Your Honor, I think the question is exhaustion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.875" offset="6778859">He does not allege he was appointed on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.186" offset="6796100">Under the Fourth Circuit decision in Coles versus Peyton which was decided in January of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.646" offset="6821909">The state arguably would have the burden of proof as to his allegations of ineffective representation of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.895" offset="6859003">Arguably he would, so arguably at least Rowe wouldn't have an adequate state remedy even after the Virginia statute goes into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.528" offset="6893484">And Your Honor, as counsel for State of Virginia, candidly conceded, it will not answer the question to vacate and remand these cases because in the Fourth Circuit at least, the court has unanimously en banc taken had decided that there is a federal remedy available and has made that federal available at least in the states in the Fourth circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.212" offset="7000168">Other states and other circuit are not making such remedy available and the federal court do not make a federal remedy available either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.695" offset="7038203">So I think even this case is of great importance for the whole administration of justice in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.447" offset="7129109">But as to these men, they have done what the Act of Congress required them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.803" offset="7154604">They've exhausted their state remedies, all the remedies that were available to them; to remand them, to the state process now when its arguable that there isn't even an effect of remedy now for them, even after the statute and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.812" offset="7218657">I do not think answers the question presented by this case and that is, is there a federal remedy for these men or if the State of Virginia decides that these men were not unconstitutionally convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.703" offset="7278216">Do they then have to wait another 25 years before they can get there Townsend versus Sane hearing in the federal court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.383" offset="7312906">If Virginia decides for any reason whatsoever, that these men should be remanded to total custody extending pass 1994 under the rule on McNally, they will not be able to get their Townsend versus Sane hearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.300" offset="7376541">And I think Your Honor I would just like briefly to speak to the effect of Case versus Nebraska on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.302" offset="7400573">Case arose on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.485" offset="7421262">In that case, the remedy asked for was and adjudications of the failure to afford state habeas corpus, what required to granting some kind of federal relief was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.901" offset="7486986">Nebraska granted the remedy the case, I think clearly became moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.675" offset="7502033">That's obviously not true here even if Virginia grants a state of remedy, it doesn't answer question of the availability of the federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.726" offset="7538291">I think there is a third reason, a third substantial reason why we should and why this Court should reconsider McNally and hold that these men are in custody in the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.839" offset="7590745">These men are both in the Virginia State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.063" offset="7603597">They are in the Maximum Security Institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.708" offset="7618226">Penologists generally talk about grades of custody within penal institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.395" offset="7641004">These men are in the maximum security prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.175" offset="7652080">They may be there because of the sentences which they alleged are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.013" offset="7675382">I agree, there is no evidence in the record in this case but then there really is no record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.344" offset="8356760">McNally was based on three premises which I think we can briefly describe as this that only iron bar custody was attackable by habeas corpus, no other restraints on liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.514" offset="8409422">Secondly, that the applicant must assert the right to a total release from this iron bar custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.963" offset="8439202">And thirdly that he must assert the right to immediate release, immediate total discharge from iron bar custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.630" offset="8473893">McNally purported to find the necessity for such an interpretation in the history of the writ at common law and in the congressional statute itself, and I think that it's correct in either case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.118" offset="8535855">Even at that time and certainly not now when the parole, the probation systems are so much more developed than they were before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.323" offset="8816619">Well Your Honor I think that there are several things that could be said to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.042" offset="8835532">In the first place I don't think that Congress has addressed itself to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.292" offset="8856534">I think if Congress has addressed itself to this point, it's at least partially come down against McNally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.348" offset="8884746">I refer to the habeas corpus Act of 1966, Section 22-44.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.896" offset="8910973">And in that section to 22-44 B, the habeas corpus Act of 1966, the statute now refers to the fact that the courts might be able to grant release from custody or other remedy on an application for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.129" offset="8995924">And I assume that that was to conform what supervisions in the preceding habeas corpus sections that all federal court, once the writ is supplied for, can grant that relief which law and justice requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.263" offset="9064469">So Your Honor I think it's important for this Court to avoid the necessity of reaching the prime issues of what the constitution requires of the great writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.194" offset="9128103">What the circumstances and the scope which the constitution requires at the great writ; I think however this Court would be based with that issue squarely unless McNally's interpretation of the statute is reevaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.593" offset="9197693">And I think this Court has already reevaluated since McNally, the interpretation given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.116" offset="9227786">For example in Jones versus Cunningham, Your Honor, I think it's quite clear that in Jones, this Court was saying that habeas corpus can be used for other things then to attack iron bar custody; that there are other restraints on liberty which the writ of habeas corpus can be used to attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="2753.238" offset="11116335">Just a few comments, I think first, able counsel's first argument was that the petitioner would be denied, these petitioners would be denied federal habeas corpus hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.395" offset="11168998">Unless the words “in custody” are interpreted to mean “not in custody” and that basically is his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.269" offset="11204420">I would most respectfully point out to this honorable Court, and I see nothing different between a hearing held in habeas corpus proceeding by a state judge and that one held by a federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.348" offset="11252799">I see no difference and in the system as we operated in Virginia and half for a number of years and there are many cases in the Fourth Circuit, most of them now per curiams where the state court has held a complete hearing and findings of fact made and the case comes over and the district judge dismisses on a state court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.823" offset="11330644">Every effort in Virginia has been made since I have been responsible to the handling of these cases for about nine years now to see to it that plenary hearings are granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.481" offset="11369305">And we make them necessary motion every time we get a case where one is required in our opinion, which is almost all of them except when they're paying frivolous or stating no facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.237" offset="11408280">We see no difference between the state and federal habeas hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.252" offset="11424371">And moreover, he has a clear right of appeal and to the Supreme Court of Appeals Virginia and in by way of certiorari to this Court in an exercise of his federal rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.078" offset="11679640">The method of computing sentences in Virginia is done in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.708" offset="11698239">One, by Virginia, sentences are served in the order in which they are received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.354" offset="11724779">There are several little exceptions to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.549" offset="11741602">One, in Thacker's for instance he was paroled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.579" offset="11757693">And while he was on parole he committed some other crimes of which he was convicted and brought back to the penitentiary and he came into the penitentiary now with a new number on these new convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.464" offset="11805236">His parole was then revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.006" offset="11815372">On the Supreme Court of Appeals on Peyton against Williams cited by counsel for the respondents held that it was appropriate that since the revocation occurred after the imposition of the new sentences, the new sentences would be served first and then the old sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.746" offset="11886320">If the revocation had occurred prior to the imposition of sentencing on the new sentences then that would've come first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.641" offset="11913906">Moreover also, escape does not change the sequence of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.125" offset="11931878">The superintendent of Virginia State Penitentiary is not authorized by statute to play tic-tac-toe with a man's record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.328" offset="11960717">It presents quite candidly many problems, particularly in the situation you outlined where he may get eight sentences in one court on one day all to run consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.898" offset="12002931">If the court order not a Virginia law, the clerk of the court of record must certify to the superintendent of the penitentiary a copy of the judgment order of conviction not just abbreviated transcript, but a copy of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.202" offset="12068133">If the order shows specifically, the other in which the sentences were imposed, which it must show that he was convicted A, B, C and D.</text>

            <text syncTime="3149.113" offset="12699773">That can complicate it but that doesn't have to usually enter into the question at all Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.326" offset="12720671">Now it was alluded also to the fact that in the Commonwealth of Virginia takes a long time to get a habeas corpus and get the case decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.560" offset="12749615">I feel that I can speak with a small amount of authority on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.523" offset="12765497">Since I have been responsible for handling these cases and operating this division of our office for about eight or nine years I think now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.006" offset="12795382">I have tried an average I guess of 100 to 150 cases some years, at both state and federal courts, and you've get a hearing a great deal faster in the court in the Commonwealth of Virginia than in a Federal District Court just that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.076" offset="12859643">So I don't see any merit to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.381" offset="12868942">Now, with regard to factors relief on counsel appointed the same day, you will find cited in our brief the case of Burley against Peyton which we'd lost in our Supreme Court of Appeals in Virginia and I think quite rightly sell we suggest that quite candidly, the court that we should lose it because counsel was appointed at the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.597" offset="12937801">Coles against Peyton which was referred to by of counsel for petitioner is one not a counsel appointed at the same day case in too as court will receive a petition for writ of certiorari in that case next week.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.825" offset="12986702">But I don't think on a factual basis that it is applicable to argument here in today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.846" offset="13010735">With regard to McNally I would call to the Court's attention that we do not hold in the Virginia all there is language in one case, although we've never employed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.052" offset="13055561">That just because a prisoner is serving will say sentence A and he's got 15 other sentences after it that he can not attack sentence A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.682" offset="13090147">That writ does not mean immediate to discharge a custody but release from that particular sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.076" offset="13111672">And this Court last week or the week before, I believe decided a case exactly on that very, very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.906" offset="13139048">So there's no problem about that in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.080" offset="13151692">In conclusion, I would most respectfully suggest that my learned friend at bar here,who has worked very hard on this case in the Fourth Circuit in here has yet been unable to take the words “in custody” and change them to mean anything other than “in custody”.</text>
