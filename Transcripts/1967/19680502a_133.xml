            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Number 133, Rob B. Kolod et. al, petitioners versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.425" offset="251131">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="43.873" stopTime="295.908">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="43.873" offset="280910">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.409" offset="295016">This case began as an indictment in the District Court for Colorado for conspiracy to transmit in interstate commerce communications containing threats designed to injure one, Robert Sunshine.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.048" offset="377563">There were then four defendants; one was acquitted and of course is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.580" offset="403790">The other three defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.919" offset="433048">At the trial, the defendant Kolod sought to introduce evidence about an illegal surveillance which is the fancy way to call it, bugging is the other way it's called at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.937" offset="505145">He offered this in rebuttal in order he said to disprove or offset evidence offered by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.499" offset="547464">The trial court examined the materials in camera and held that they were not relevant and that the evidence could not be introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.942" offset="597201">The three defendants who were convicted appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and pending the appeal, the Government disclosed that it had additional files relating to conversations overheard at the Desert Inn.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.834" offset="672747">The case was remanded to the District Court to examine this material in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.903" offset="696989">The Court found nothing admissible in the additional material.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.201" offset="722275">Thereafter, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.204" offset="742233">A petition for certiorari was filed here and was denied in October 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.826" offset="780685">Now that is the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.978" offset="793328">Before going further, I should point out that the electronic surveillance material examined in the courts below related to the defendant Kolod and the premises which he used in Las Vegas, Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.555" offset="863650">Kolod has since died and the petition as to him has been dismissed on January 29th of this year.Consequently, there is nothing now before the court relating to the electronic surveillance material which was considered by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.966" offset="949332">We now have wholly new problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.647" offset="968035">At the post trial hearing in the District Court and in the petition for certiorari here, counsel for Alderisio, another -- the defendants stated that there was newly discovered evidence of a wiretap or listening device used against his client in Chicago between October 1, 1960 and December 31, 1962.?</text>
            <text syncTime="247.079" offset="1093736">The nature or source of this evidence was not stated, it is this surveillance in Chicago relating to the petitioner Alderisio with which the court is now concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.964" offset="1161237">After the denial of the petition for certiorari, the petitioners sought an order suspending the denial of certiorari pending the filing of a petition for a rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.146" offset="1214004">Mr. Spritzer, the acting Solicitor General made a typewritten response to this application.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.135" offset="1242008">Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for rehearing and a motion for the disclosure of electronic surveillance and this is the matter which is now before the Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="295.908" stopTime="303.728">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="295.908" offset="1289028">We'll recess now.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.959" offset="1305224">Mr. Solicitor General, you may continue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="303.728" stopTime="441.005">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="303.728" offset="1320375">Just before the recess, I said that counsel for the petitioners had filed a petition for a rehearing and a motion for the disclosure of electronic surveillance and that that was where we were now.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.433" offset="1387144">I left out another step which is the step which is the one which brings us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.181" offset="1418177">The United States made a response to that motion and the Court then on January 29th, entered an order with -- an opinion remanding the case for an adversary proceeding in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.736" offset="1488394">It was then that the United States filed the motion which is now before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.820" offset="1516711">This is entitled a motion to Modify the Order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.531" offset="1539594">In this motion, we accept without a question of any sort this Court's decision that the petitioners here are entitled to the independent determination of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.561" offset="1595705">We urged however that this should be done in the first instance by the judge in camera with the judge then being free to order such further proceedings as he may deem necessary or appropriate as a result of his examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.129" offset="1677939">This is the procedure, we would point out which was followed in this case with respect to the Kolod surveillance in Las Vegas.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.797" offset="1716600">This was directly approved by the court below and this court denied certiorari with the questions specifically raised in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.014" offset="1753485">Of course that denial is in no sense binding on the court but I do mentioned it to show that there is some precedent for what we urged and similarly the Seventh Circuit as recently sustains such a procedure in the case of Battaglia against United States which was decided there on April 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.556" offset="1855676">Why should we be concerned?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="441.005" offset="1869469">Is that a reported case Mr. Solicitor General?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="443.446" stopTime="460.335">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="443.446" offset="1879186">Its -- it is simply cited that way in our brief Mr. Justice, Battaglia against United States but it is not yet in any -- in the federal reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.083" offset="1921714">I have a copy of the opinion here which I can gladly leave with the clerk if that would be helpful.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="460.335" stopTime="463.712">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="460.335" offset="1946791">It might be helpful to me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="463.712" stopTime="1530.012">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="463.712" offset="1960270">Why should be we concerned?</text>
            <text syncTime="466.723" offset="1972287">Why shouldn't the defendants and their counsel be free to see everything and make what they can of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="474.369" offset="2002902">To borrow a phrase, the automatic knee-jerk reaction would be that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.458" offset="2031219">The question is whether there are any other factors in the situation which merit further consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.135" offset="2069985">I'm not sure that there are, I can say though that the entire problem is a very trouble someone and is full of difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.738" offset="2116378">Various aspects of it have been before the court in seven cases which have been disposed of and there are now six cases pending before the court in which it is involved including this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.092" offset="2181789">For the possible convenience of the court, these have all been lifted -- listed in a brief memorandum which I prepared and have asked the clerk to make available to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.359" offset="2234870">I find in the process, I've tried to put together a complete collection of all of the papers which have dealt with this problem and they're now 32 items in my collection and it's something of a task simply to keep them sorted out in one's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.367" offset="2318879">The problem first became apparent nearly two years ago in the case of Black against the United States where after the denial of certiorari, the Solicitor General filed a memorandum in May 1966 which disclosed electronic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.865" offset="2408845">In response to instructions from the court, a further memorandum was filed in July 1966 going in to considerable detail not only as to what had been done but also what the Department of Justice was doing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.964" offset="2489302">The court then vacated the conviction of Black and remanded the case to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.064" offset="2521694">In that case, there was no doubt that the materials were relevant and the sole question was to determine whether they had led to any of the evidence that was used at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.856" offset="2580835">Why should not the same procedure be used in every case?</text>
            <text syncTime="623.035" offset="2597554">Perhaps it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.495" offset="2607376">This is not an area where there are any clear guides either of principle or of experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.900" offset="2637051">I've worried about the problem almost constantly for the past six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.449" offset="2663173">As a result, I have at least come to the conclusion that there are some matters which are worthy of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.107" offset="2701834">The problem of relevance of the material is one you can't get away from.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.447" offset="2731196">One might say, Well, you bugged him, didn't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="661.630" offset="2751990">You admit you did, Why don't you come plea and give him the material?</text>
            <text syncTime="668.679" offset="2780097">But perhaps it's more complicated than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.549" offset="2795666">Seeing the fruits of bugging as a new experience for me, it's a little like putting a live television camera on a street corner all sorts of things happen, most of it is very dull, some of the rest is titillating but quite irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.555" offset="2891692">There's an almost infinite gradation.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.932" offset="2909142">Let us suppose that a microphone is put in a room which picks up a conference between the defendant and his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.798" offset="2948639">Of course this should be disclosed and where any conversations between a defendant and his lawyer have appeared, we have always disclosed this since the problem arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.541" offset="3007572">We may next suppose that a bug is put in a room of defendant A, this may pick up conversations of A and these may or may not have any conceivable connection with a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.609" offset="3075908">A may discuss a contemplated crime, this might be the crime for which he is being prosecuted or some other unrelated crime or A may discuss a trip he plans to take with another man's wife intrastate in order to keep it from being federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.228" offset="3166292">Moreover, if A's premises are bugged, particularly office or business premises, conversations of many persons may be picked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.768" offset="3220522">In experience, most of the records of the bugging of A's premises will consist of conversations of other persons than A quite often without A being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.642" offset="3279976">Of course such conversation might be relevant to criminal conduct by A and we agree that a judge should decide that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.651" offset="3324071">But generally they will not though they may involve other persons often in highly libelous or embarrassing ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.087" offset="3361792">Should everything be disclosed to A and his counsel even though the conversations are of other people who had no reason to expect that their conversations would be overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.479" offset="3407350">There's a catch overtone in this problem even though the conversations are of other people and have nothing to do with A's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.162" offset="3458027">Perhaps most remote is the situation where the bug is put on B unconnected with A.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.495" offset="3495434">But A wonders into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.839" offset="3508809">A comes into the room for some purpose, perhaps business, perhaps a social call, perhaps out of curiosity or by mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.244" offset="3554367">What may be picked up from A may be relevant but does this mean that the entire record should be made available for A's inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.072" offset="3605671">In an underworld atmosphere which is sometimes involved in this cases, there maybe wholly irrelevant things said by other persons which would be very interesting indeed to the person who would not get such information unless there had been illegal activity by representatives of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.409" offset="3691039">Should all of these be made available to A merely because at some point he came in to the sound tracking?</text>
            <text syncTime="906.682" offset="3732104">It's bad enough that there was such illegal activity but does the fact there was illegal activity mean that its fruits must be broadcast to the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.231" offset="3782363">As happened in the (Inaudible) case in Boston last May where the materials became an exhibit in the case to somebody's carelessness, I don't know who, it was not sealed, they were then copied by the press in the clerk's office and reproduced with big headlines by many newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.328" offset="3878703">It said that this can be safeguarded against by proper protective orders in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.549" offset="3911617">All that I can say is that this has not worked perfectly in practice and I doubt that it will in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.855" offset="3944845">In any event, it does not protect third persons from disclosure to the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.861" offset="3972848">And that may in some cases be a very serious matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.106" offset="3993851">Suppose, for example, that in the bugging of A's premises, two of his lieutenants were picked up in his absence discussing how they might displaced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.480" offset="4051320">Thus, it is important to note that the question of what disclosure the Government makes of conversations which it has overheard, involves more than just a right of a particular defendant before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.312" offset="4118716">It involves the right of each of the participants to the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.752" offset="4140450">We believe that the rights of these other participants in overheard conversations and of still other persons to whom reference is made in conversations are also entitled to protection and that the interest these individuals have in keeping the conversations private will often militate against the unnecessary disclosure of the conversations to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.541" offset="4251627">Under the procedure that Mr. Williams proposes, no protection would be given to the interest to these third persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.840" offset="4284750">We submit that by giving the trial judge the discretion to make an in camera examination of the records of the overhearing some degree of protection can be provided to these third parties since records of their conversation would only be disclosed to the defendant if they were arguably relevant to the case at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.247" offset="4390390">I don't know what the answer is, it is however to coin another phrase, a condition and not of theory that we are confronted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.704" offset="4444202">I have sometimes felt that the answer is that we should gather up all of these records and take them to the place in the treasury where they disposed of worn out paper money and have them all totally destroyed, macerated I think is the term with appropriate witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.046" offset="4533645">But we obviously cant do that, indeed in one of the cases now pending before the court, McGarry against the United States number 1184, we are in trouble because something like that did happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.244" offset="4602399">The records there were destroyed, I think without any evil intent but the fact is that they're gone and we don't -- we can't say what was in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.433" offset="4639180">My observation leads me to believe that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been very methodical about all this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.503" offset="4675438">Their records have been well and carefully kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.200" offset="4690171">One can find out where a bug is placed and the dates when it was in use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.191" offset="4710233">There's an index not merely of the person's bug but a person's mentioned in the interceptive conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.471" offset="4743356">However, in the case of some other Government agencies, the records are more scanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.550" offset="4767598">Often records have been destroyed and indexing is less than satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.382" offset="4794974">I suppose that with the passage of time, these problems will fade away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.183" offset="4822141">But for the time being, they are very troublesome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.465" offset="4843248">Finally, I come to another and very important aspect of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.435" offset="4871147">It's not directly involved in this Kolod case but the order here may affect it and it cannot be overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.185" offset="4910122">The question is involved in Ivanov against the United States, number 885 and Butenko against the United States number 1007 miscellaneous which are pending before the court on petition of certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.217" offset="7766246">The outset I would like to make an analysis if I may of the Government's position with respect to this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.531" offset="7811594">I'm afraid a fairly hostile analysis because I'm concerned that the sheer proliferation of instances of microphone surveillance that have come to light in last year or so have began to dull our capacity for indignation, at the practice, at its consequences and at Government's position with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.422" offset="7955059">From the papers that have been filed in this case, we readily conclude that petitioner had his premises under electronic surveillance for a non-disclosed indeterminate amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.286" offset="8022559">That a device was placed on his business premises for the purpose of picking up his private conversations for an indeterminate length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.654" offset="8064042">And we further can conclude that in fact his private conversations were picked up over an indeterminate period of time and they were recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.344" offset="8118794">Logs, memoranda and records were made of those conversations which are now in the possession of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.182" offset="8162158">We can further conclude that of course his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment have been violated by agents of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.267" offset="8214507">And we can further conclude that in doing these acts, agents of the Government transgressed the criminal statutes of the United States because Title 18 of Section 241 makes it a crime to injure any citizen in the enjoyment and the exercise of his constitutional rights, it makes it a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment up to 10 years and a fine of $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.181" offset="8346164">And we can conclude further, because this Court can judicially notice the statutes of the State of Illinois that agents of the Government in cavalier fashion violated the statutes of Illinois because there is a very stringent eavesdropping statute which makes it a crime amenable to a term of imprisonment for the perpetrator, to eavesdrop by an electronic device for the purpose of overhearing the private conversations of a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.129" offset="8477926">This Court, beginning 14 years ago, put the spoken word within the penumbra of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.442" offset="8515229">It did it for the first time in Irvine against California back in 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.648" offset="9136003">And protective orders can be issued under Rule 16 for the benefit of those third parties who are on petitioners' premises who conversed between themselves and who would like to have their privacy protected to the full extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2296.837" offset="9292737">It's asking this Court further to formulate a policy predicated on the fact that the miscreant eavesdropper has a greater interest in the privacy of the victim than their victim has.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.077" offset="12381769">Because the way it's done, if the Court please, supposing the taxpayer had a telephone conversation with his lady friend to use the same illustration as was used earlier, as the result of the lead from that conversation the lady friend will be interviewed and as a result of that, ffurriers and jewelers and perhaps automobile salesman will be unearthed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.139" offset="12485945">They will show up as witnesses at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.792" offset="12496603">There will be nothing to suggest that that lead came from what might have been an innocuous conversation with his ex-lady friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.338" offset="12530772">And how it would be concealed, it will be concealed in the most interesting clandestine and surreptitious way because the nomenclature in the lexicon of the eavesdroppers is confidential informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.102" offset="12585838">As the result of a disclosure from a confidential informant, we interviewed C, the ex-lady friend of the suspect and we found out the following so that there is no way that the judge is going to know that this evidence has been unearthed as a result of an electronic eavesdropping device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.105" offset="12677789">And in fact as we point out in our papers, Government counsel themselves have been beguiled by this tactic and have stood up in good conscience and in good faith and made misrepresentations to the court with respect to the source of their evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.773" offset="12748528">Why, because the eavesdropper conceals his illegality and his illicit conduct and he does it with a standard investigative nomenclature confidential informant discloses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.330" offset="12802759">Furthermore, we have shown illustrations where the monitor in charge of the case has been more sophisticated than to reduce this to writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.339" offset="12846749">Instead, he monitors the electronic device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.657" offset="12864094">He listens for leads and then that evening he calls in the field and he tells the field agents go check this out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.764" offset="12992512">When the superior is then called to the stand to find out where he got his lead, he has the cloak of confidential informant and the bug is not unearth and I suggest that only counsel, counsel with his dedication to his plan will lead all that material and who knows the facts and who knows the case from beginning to end can do the job of determining what is relevant and what is germane and what leads were unearthed with respect to the prosecution (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.066" offset="13701684">That case went to the Circuit and of course it was overturned, it was reversed and the court found that there was error there of constitutional dimensions and the court reversed the case and sent it back for a retrial that never took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.658" offset="13916097">I say if the Court please, that the root of the question post by the Government's motion is this, is it alright for the Government to say to one of its citizens even with the approbation of a federal district judge, we have had a faceless informer in your house furlough these many months and we have listened to you conversations and we have recorded those conversations and we have them in logs, in memoranda and records in our warehouse of stolen privacy but be of good cheer because we have examined them and we find nothing significant to this pending case so for the moment you are safe and so that you will continue to be safe we'll just keep all of these records and these memoranda and these logs but its better that you don't know what is in them.</text>
