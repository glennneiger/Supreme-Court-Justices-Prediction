            <label>Mr. James V. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="42.662" offset="274056">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.344" offset="304776">We are concerned here with the case of Hanover, a manufacturer of men's shoes brought against the defendant, United for damages occasioned by United's monopolization of the shoe machinery trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.324" offset="400697">Hanover leased from United all of the machines involved in this case at least which is needed in the manufacture of its shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.439" offset="457122">There were no comp -- machines, comparable in quality with the United's machines which were available from any other domestic or foreign source.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.808" offset="514591">The District Court undisturbed by the Court of Appeals found that United's monopoly position was from 89% to 100% of the 20 most important machines which accounted for 80% of the royalties which Hanover paid United, and it's monopoly position was from 85% to 100% of all but six of the machines and there were a total of 58 which Hanover rented from United.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.566" offset="665684">Now, all of those machine types were available to Hanover from United solely on a lease only basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.752" offset="710405">In 1947, the government brought an action against United and I shall refer to that action as the government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.430" offset="765053">In that action, the District Court held that United's lease only policy, the provisions of its leases and related sales policies or related policies having to do with its relations with its customers were exclusionary and illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.114" offset="855855">And it held on the basis of its findings that United had monopolized the shoe machinery trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.748" offset="890337">Now, in the course of this argument I am going to use the shorthand phrase, leasing system to describe the leases and the bundle of policies which were condemned by the District Court in the government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.848" offset="958777">On the basis of its decision, the Court in the government action enjoined the leasing system and directed that, from the date to be fixed, United should offer no machine of those involved for lease unless it also offered it for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.783" offset="1074552">The decision of the District Court in the government's action as Your Honors well know was affirmed by this Court in a per curiam decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.362" offset="1128782">The decree in the government action was offered and received in evidence by the District Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.596" offset="1161801">The District Court below in arriving at its findings and conclusions relied on that decree on the findings and conclusions of the Court in the government action and also an additional proof of monopolization which Hanover offered at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.085" offset="1243721">With respect to damages, Hanover offered two kinds of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.991" offset="1275382">It's first kind of proof what the District Court refers to as a primary claim, consisted of a comparison between the rentals which United actually -- I mean, which Hanover, pardon me, actually paid to United and what it would have cost Hanover if it had owned the machines and met the necessary ownership cost, that was one method.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.439" offset="1401083">The second method was based on 19 instances which we found in the evidence in the record in the government action, instances where United had reduced its rents and royalties on machines when it was faced with competition, with respect to those machines and I might mention though that a matter purely of interest that the percentage reductions ranged from 11% to 82% and averaged out at 43%.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.300" offset="1560534">The District Court held that with respect to that evidence which was tendered to show excessiveness in the rents and royalties themselves, the plaintiff, Hanover had failed to prove excessiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.636" offset="1625945">United in its briefs consistently asserts that its rents and royalties have been held reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.902" offset="1662934">There is no such holding by the District Court in this case or by the District Court in the government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.201" offset="1692191">The holding was that Hanover failed to prove excessiveness which is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.314" offset="1724583">The District Court, however, in this action found that under Hanover's primary proof, the comparison of leasing with ownership cost, Hanover had demonstrated that it had been damaged in the sum of $1,413,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.212" offset="1804204">That is what had cost Hanover to lease the machines over and above what it would have cost Hanover if it have had the opportunity in a free market to buy the machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.573" offset="1857703">On United's appeal to the Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, that Court affirmed with respect to all claims, all questions having to do with liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.624" offset="1921860">And United's appeal to that Court presented every question that's involved in the conditional cross petition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.193" offset="1964178">It did, however, order a new trial, limited to damages on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.242" offset="1996361">The first of these grounds is that the award of damages should be reduced by the so called tax benefits, tax disadvantages that ownership would entail to it as I understand the opinion that if Hanover had been the owner, it would not have had the advantage, it did have as lessee in that as lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.850" offset="2122794">It was able to deduct all its rents and royalties on its tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.746" offset="2150379">And also that as owner, Hanover would have had to pay capital gains taxes on any machines itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.017" offset="2195414">Now it's strange to my poor simple mind as the Court of Appeals decision is with respect to the deduction of the expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.022" offset="2231463">It loses me completely with respect to the capital gains because as I will mention in a moment the reason is that Hanover must be assumed to have had a choice and you calculate the damages as they would have been calculated if Hanover had a choice, but assuming Hanover had choice, how Hanover in deciding to buy the machine could tell when and what amount it would have a capital gain completely escapes me.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.634" offset="2357896">There is no evidence in the record that if Hanover had purchased machines, it would have sold them before the end of their useful lives or that if it did sell them, it would have sold them for more than the depreciated value on the books of Hanover.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.017" offset="2431457">Now this we submit, this holding of the Court of Appeals with respect to so called tax advantages that Hanover enjoyed under the leasing system is error.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.937" offset="2483075">We start from one basic fundamental principle that there is no law, that we have been able to discover and no basis in fact in this case why Hanover should be treated any differently from any other treble-damage plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.785" offset="2582549">Such plaintiffs always are permitted to recover the full damage sustained by them without regard to tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.725" offset="2622255">We haven't found a single case which could see the so called tax consequences, may be cover the excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.904" offset="2654960">The excess here was the amount by which the leasing cost exceeded what would have been the ownership cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.721" offset="2698219">Our calculations as such are not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.035" offset="2719535">There is one challenge that Mr. Carson makes that I will come to, but the Courts below did not challenge them.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.854" offset="2738761">What the Court of Appeals did in the District Court we submit was correct in its oppose to this case was to disregard what has been traditionally the basic rule of damages that in approaching damages, courts do not go beyond the first step and this is a rule that has been recognized constantly over the years, in both contracts and torts cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.975" offset="2863313">Now the Court of Appeals' reasoning --</text>

            <label>Mr. James V. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="705.141" offset="2923917">It means that the damage is measured at the time of the impact of the wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.700" offset="2950144">What happens after that is just not considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.099" offset="2963728">That is as I understand the meaning of the rule, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.536" offset="2985566">The Court of Appeals' reasoning here is rather than intriguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.490" offset="3001344">They begin with the finding below, well supported by the evidence that if Hanover had had the opportunity, it would have bought the machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.852" offset="3038751">And then they do -- they went to a bit of vaticination.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.248" offset="3060381">They say now if Hanover had been free to choose, what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="746.200" offset="3088175">It would like every other businessman have weighed the two courses open to it, leasing and owning.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.242" offset="3136345">And that business has been generally when weighing such choices, consider not merely the gross but the net, they consider the tax consequences that might be involved in either choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.633" offset="3189948">And accordingly, since businessmen would normally consider the tax consequences, as if the tax consequences looked upon by businessmen would be inherent in their choice, damages should be calculated in the same fashion as the decision whether to buy or sell by looking prospectively, retrospectively, prospectively at tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.015" offset="3303424">Now to begin with, I mentioned the Court of Appeals and United has mentioned of the so called tax (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="810.111" offset="3343862">Under the law, they are non existent.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.514" offset="3361416">All expenses of leasing, all expenses of ownership are fully deductible on taxpayer's tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.080" offset="3427662">The error of the Court of Appeals here aside from going beyond the first step, the error inherent in this choice reasoning of theirs is their assumption that the elements which are considered by businessmen in deciding whether or not they will take a certain business step are the elements that must be considered by courts in deciding or rather in calculating the amount of the damage sustained by an injured plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.546" offset="3565589">That is a necessary part of their error.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.610" offset="3589831">And even this talk of choice to my again, poor, simple mind is beyond the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.109" offset="3631835">Hanover had no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.497" offset="3645315">Hanover, we have demonstrated, was compelled by monopolization to pay out more money for the operation of its business than it would have paid would not -- would have paid in a free market and they were forced to pay it out because they operated in a monopolized market.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.595" offset="3725772">If in fact Hanover had a choice, it could have been bought or leased, we will have no claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.243" offset="3760358">That would be nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.633" offset="3765896">It was the lack of choice by which Hanover was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.996" offset="3787316">And what Hanover might have done or Hanover might have considered, assuming it had a choice or would any other businessman might or might not have considered, we submit is of utmost of academic interest and would have nothing to do with the question as what was the amount of the damage to Hanover.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.708" offset="3890239">Now, it is not at all surprising that the Court of Appeals cited no authority, non exists which it could cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.067" offset="3931617">The nearest approach to an authority with the sort of reasoning it gives, it said, it's just as realistic to deduct taxes as it was for the District Court to require that in calculating the damages, the servicing expenses on the machines should be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.482" offset="4029315">It is an equation that I am afraid escapes me.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.226" offset="4044257">It is a new part of my talking criminal matters but I am addressing myself to the Court of Appeals' comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.146" offset="4075917">Servicing expenses quite obviously of expenses of operation that are met and paid before whenever reaches net profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.627" offset="4121893">Taxes have nothing to do as such with the operation of a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.681" offset="4142059">They are a sharing on the part of the taxpayer with the sovereign of what the taxpayer has left after he has arrived at his net profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.941" offset="4195140">Now in no sense as United would suggest any very noble or unique case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.882" offset="4226905">It's not the first time that plaintiffs in antitrust actions have been damaged by being forced to incur greater cost because of an antitrust violation than they would have incurred absent the violation and it very likely that in every such case, the injured plaintiffs deducted those excess costs on their tax returns because there are operations of a business, but it was never been suggested that I can find that such plaintiffs should not recover the full amount of the excess cost or that the excess cost should have been deducted from them the taxes they saved because they deducted the excess cost on their tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.049" offset="4407568">This is what is novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.171" offset="4416031">There is no case in the books which even suggests it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.971" offset="4439228">I beg your pardon, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.082" offset="4451662">The damage sustained by it, if I may paraphrase the statute, was the full excess extracted from Hanover by United through its monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.603" offset="4517804">Now, one purpose of damages is to put the parties back in the positions they would have occupied if there had never been a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.484" offset="4553331">In the examples in our briefs, we have demonstrated that by disregarding the Court of Appeals rule, forgetting this choice business and tax business, the parties are put back where they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.161" offset="4628041">But by taking the Court of Appeals rule and applying it, using a 50% assumed tax rate, the result is that the United, the monopolizer, the violator is left with half of the unlawful exaction and the victim, Hanover is out of pocket the same amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.324" offset="4732635">We submit that an approach which leaves the wrong doer with his illegal games and the victim out of profit could not possibly come under the heading of a symbol on the top of the entrance to this Courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.839" offset="4826676">Now the second ground upon which the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial was that the damage period should be cut almost halfway through its full statutory distance because of the view of the Court of Appeals that the decision of this Court on June 10, 1946, an American Tobacco case brought about a change in the law and so the Court of Appeals would cut off Hanover's damages at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.525" offset="5009429">United goes much further in its brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.591" offset="5093752">United in its number 463, looks upon the Court of Appeals which is a defense but as a secondary position, United's primary position is that the decree in the government action can be given no retroactive effect whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.242" offset="5248293">Now, if I may address myself for a moment first to United's position, we can find no authority, no principle, and the whole history of the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, legislative history, cases which supports United's position that a decree in a government action shall be looked upon prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.187" offset="5368142">And here again, we submit that Hanover should not be treated any differently from the way any other antitrust plaintiff is treated, as the main antitrust plaintiff who relies on a decree in a prior government case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.887" offset="5442957">All such government decrees and again, I apologize for stressing premier concepts, are based on the findings of the Court in the Government case and an adjudication of a violation of the law in the past or there would be no basis for the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.467" offset="5545253">And then the decree operates prospectively because it can't operate any other way as to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.064" offset="5575659">It wipes out the illegal action or it wipes out the conduct, the illegal conduct in the future, but it cannot change the illegal conduct that it found to have existed in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.321" offset="5632606">United's proposed rule is very interesting one so far as further damage and plaintiffs are concerned and treble-damage plaintiffs have a hard enough time as it is proving their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.079" offset="5687672">But per United's rule, there would never be an occasion on the statutory provision that the decree in the government action is prima facie evidence would ever be possible at all, because if decrees operate prospectively, they would contain no adjudication as to the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.354" offset="5796760">Now the fact is that the evidence of a government action covers many years going back to before the 1920's if I remember rightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.688" offset="5830092">The findings on that case were based on that evidence and in this Court's per curiam enforced affirmance, we find a very pertinent language that the finding of that case to government action now, that the findings are justified by the evidence and support the decree and that is the decree on which Hanover is relying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.792" offset="5950568">Now neither in that decree itself or in the findings of the District Court of Massachusetts, or in this Courts affirmance, is there any suggestion that there is a cut off at any particular point?</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.855" offset="6018800">Nowhere in the decision of the District Court below is there any suggestion of a cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.981" offset="6051297">There, the government decree or the decree in the government action, the findings, the conclusions of the Court in that action and the additional evidence introduced by Hanover covered the whole period of the statute of limitations as told.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.598" offset="6137814">The Court of Appeals holds however, now this is fine, however while everything United did after June 10, 1946 was precisely the same as United did prior to June 10, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.532" offset="6253484">Everything United did after that date is unlawful and damages may be recovered for it and everything it did prior to that date was lawful and there may be no damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.903" offset="6315029">Now, I think we have demonstrated in our briefs that there is no prior case, no prior rule of law that was overruled by American Tobacco or by Alcoa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.090" offset="6403741">And both of those decisions as we have pointed out relied on decisions pre-dating United's adoption of the leasing system condemned in the government action and they adopted that in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.996" offset="6483362">Both Justice -- Judge Hand and this Court relied on decisions predating 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.264" offset="6520456">The most that can be said about American Tobacco or Alcoa is that they were new developments made, new interpretations, but of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.715" offset="6574268">Of a statute that goes back to 1890 and the principles that have been established many years before, and that happens constantly in the antitrust field.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.086" offset="7143737">That monopolization is continuous and as the Courts below had found and as we have set forth in our brief, every single time, United exacts from Hanover a rent and royalty payment which enables to exact because of its violation of the law, there is a new cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.771" offset="7250422">Hanover here is seeking only for those costs to which it was exposed by the monopolization during the statutory period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.470" offset="8009226">The supposed change of law that ought to take in place on June 10, 1946, cane be phrased very simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.637" offset="8053948">The law had been as a mere sized on exerted power, the actions of predatory practices does not constitute an antitrust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.176" offset="8116120">Now if one looks at the statute one finds not a word about predatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.054" offset="8147571">The statute speaks about monopolizing commerce, about restraints on competition, the statute is aimed at developing and maintaining a free market and the statute doesn't have any distinction between polite restraints and impolite restraints, between gentlemanly exclusions from the market or ungentlemanly exclusions from the market, but let us assume the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.605" offset="8273795">Let us assume it is still the law that mid-size, un-exerted power do not constitute a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.583" offset="8321755">The trouble with the principle is that it doesn't fit United.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.813" offset="8338578">There is no question that United have the size and the power with its tremendous monopolistic position in the shoe machinery trade particularly the machines that Hanover had to lease from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.757" offset="8406392">But through its leasing system, which was condemned in the government action, it used that very power and monopolistic position to preserve that very power and position to the very means by which it practically married the shoe manufacturers to its monopoly, maintaining the shoe manufacturers as the courts below has said as a captive market through its exclusion of competition one can hardly say its power was un-exerted, one certainly cannot deny its size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.683" offset="8598131">The very success it met over the years by these exclusionary practices proves that its maintenance of its monopoly position is and its ultimate evidence of the effectiveness of the exclusionary practices condemned in the government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.943" offset="8683186">That was just no need here in this market for United to avoid competition by, if I may use a word that I found in one of the opinions of this Court, by such a crafts method as price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.367" offset="8776808">It's method was exclusionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.800" offset="8786526">Its method as the courts below held as the District Court in the government action held excluded actual and potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.389" offset="8840965">We submit that there was no basis at all for the Court of Appeals taking it up on itself to split the damage period practically half way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.563" offset="8889657">We submit the Court of Appeals was in error on the second ground of our petition in 335.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.170" offset="8928005">Now something that must be mentioned in connection with the claims of no retroactivity whether one considers United's claims in 463 or the Court of Appeals' approach for the three prior cases against United.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.201" offset="9012224">In the District Court in this case, United claimed that it was resting on a unique record of res judicata.</text>

            <text syncTime="2252.805" offset="9114624">At recess, I began to mention that in the District Court below, United asserted that it was resting on a unique record of res judicata with respect to the three prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.741" offset="9178363">I think the short answer to that is that on the oral argument on the appeal from the government action before this Court, United's counsel, then counsel not Mr. Carson, was expressly asked if he considered the three prior cases res judicata and answered with a flat no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.264" offset="9276479">United also claims that its lease only policy was not condemned in the government action, and here again on that same appeal on the government action but in the briefs, United's counsel described the lease only policy as what the District Court found to be the basic vice in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.720" offset="9374281">But aside from all that, United really claims that the three prior actions approved its leasing policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.110" offset="9427780">We have set forth in our briefs and I'm not going to take this Court's time detailing it, an analysis of those cases and specifically what each one of them held and I make the flat statement that what was condemned in the government action had never been presented in this Court before and accordingly had not been passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.591" offset="9545749">In 1922, after the decision in the Clayton Act case which throughout all of the tying provisions in United's leases, United adopted the forms of leases and leasing policy which I call a leasing system which was before the Court in the government case and over the years, it added some additional policies which are also part of that leasing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.858" offset="9650761">It was that combination which was attacked in the government action and that combination had never been passed upon before or sanctioned before by any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.161" offset="9704051">And it was that combination of policies and practices which was held to constitute monopolization at the District Court and I am afraid I am repeating on this on the basis of that combination held that the United had excluded actual and potential competition and restricted a free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.477" offset="9797256">I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.065" offset="9807600">In the course of its opinion, the District Court in the government action detailed the effects that United's policies and practices produced on shoe manufacturers and not on only shoe machinery manufacturers that were also set forth, but on shoe manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.671" offset="9886072">Now, in our brief we treat on the law with the target area argument that is presented by United in 463, but I think the short answer to this whole target area argument is found in the findings of the District Court in the United action and the government action as to precisely what the effects were on shoe manufacturers of United's exclusionary policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.765" offset="9998399">As a matter of fact, it seems to me extremely difficult to imagine anybody who could be more directly affected by a monopoly than the customer who must deal with the monopoly into the monopolized market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.469" offset="10069243">Now, neither Court below found the decree in the government action ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.267" offset="10100485">They both found it to hold what I have said in the course of my argument to Your Honors that it does hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.769" offset="10130474">But United in 463 seeks to create an ambiguity in what the Court held in the government action and it claims that the Court in the government action did not hold the lease only policy to be a means of monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.843" offset="10222738">And building on this claim, it contrives an ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.896" offset="10250951">And on the basis of the contrived ambiguity, it claims that the District Court below should have certified the question of what the government decree meant to the District Court of Massachusetts and United now claims error because of the failure of the District Court below to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.454" offset="10345200">Now to begin with, there is no rule or practice in the federal system whereby treble-damage courts should refer to decree entering courts for an interpretation of decrees entered in the decree entering court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.031" offset="10439450">The treble-damage court's job is to decide the case before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.632" offset="10461915">There is the decree in black and white and this decree was not merely the decree of the District Court of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.974" offset="10499218">It was in effect the decree of this Court because it had been affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.903" offset="10534954">Obviously, every treble-damage court passing upon a decree entered in another court has the task of asking itself what does this decree mean and it arrives at an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.568" offset="10593677">If it is wrong, it can be reversed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.958" offset="10607156">There is no need for running back and forth between courts and I can conceive of no greater waste of judicial time and judicial manpower in such a rule as United contends for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.867" offset="10670791">Another contrived argument advanced by United here is that the lease only charge was dismissed by the court in the government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.590" offset="10725752">Again, we have spelled out in detail the complaint, the finding and so on in the court, in the decision and opinion of the Court in the government action, and we submit that it is crystal clear that the charges there dismissed related to other vices of the industry in which United was involved and did not relate to the shoe machinery industry which that court specifically held had been monopolized by United.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.182" offset="10888129">Further, United would escape liability here by the so called passing on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.272" offset="10916446">Now this passing on issue was a subject of a separate trial back in 1959 or 1960, four days of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.612" offset="10965870">It was decided by the District Court in United's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.355" offset="10980812">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.919" offset="10991052">This Court denied certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.744" offset="11018324">I do mean Hanover's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.913" offset="11026996">I am -- Hanover's counsel I believe in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.215" offset="11060224">Untied says however that the measure of damages that was before Judge Goodrich in the passing on trial was a different measure of damages from what Hanover presented at the trial and that is just not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.236" offset="11124276">The separate trial was held on the basis of a stipulation as to what Judge Goodrich was to decide and that stipulation provide that it should be assumed for the purposes of the trial not only that there was a violation of law but that the excessive cost of shoe machinery as alleged in the complaint existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.162" offset="11232005">Now let us look at Hanover's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.595" offset="11241723">Hanover's complaint alleged the two types of injury that I mentioned, excessiveness of rentals and the excessive cost of machinery by being denied the right to purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.239" offset="11288325">And I was interesting to read -- interested to read in United's main brief in 463 at page 14 that United itself set forth that both kinds of injury were alleged in Hanover's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.621" offset="11377873">United suggests that the primary claim below, the comparison between leasing and ownership cost was first advanced at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.345" offset="11424789">It must have been a stoop of memory on the part of United's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.802" offset="11446627">United knew this in the very beginning, we alleged it in our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.071" offset="11463659">Copies of our tabulations in the course of discovery have been delivered to United long before the trial began.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.432" offset="11501066">But really, there passing on argument of United is based primarily on the Oil Java cases and no similarity can be found between those cases and the Hanover situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.893" offset="11558954">Unlike the Oil Jobers (ph) cases there was no guaranteed margin here, basically, the cases could not be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.555" offset="11593644">Unlike the Oil Jobbers, Hanover did not buy and sell machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.136" offset="11615901">Hanover used the machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.695" offset="11626141">It was a consumer so to speak of the use of the machinery it leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.475" offset="11657279">Further there was absolutely no relation between the rather infrequent changes in United's rents and royalties and the very frequent changes in the sales prices of Hanover shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.624" offset="11725824">Actually, as one analyzes United's argument on passing on, it comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.096" offset="11755708">Hanover operated at a profit during the whole period, therefore it must have passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.335" offset="11800743">If it didn't pass on, it might have operated at a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.899" offset="11823000">So we have a new rule of antitrust law that the treble-damage plaintiff who despised restraints makes a profit, may not recover but the treble-damage plaintiff who was unfortunate enough to lose money may recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.688" offset="11894157">I find no justification in statute or case for such a doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.851" offset="11918817">The short answer of this whole passing on was the one that Judge Goodrich gave and at first Mr. Justice Stewart was that courts do not go beyond the first step in assessing damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.163" offset="11975973">And secondly that if the excess cost had not been imposed on United, Hanover would have more money to use whatever it wanted to use it for in its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.395" offset="12036995">And there is here contrary to United's contention, no wind fall to Hanover rather a balancing of the scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.067" offset="12087672">I suspect that if windfall if any is what United would like to have by keeping the fruits of its monopoly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.727" offset="12602284">And let us assume further as was the case in the Oil Jobber case that United guaranteed that we would still make this much money on sales of shoes as we had if they did not increase their sales prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.306" offset="12728613">United further would deny recovery here because it says there was no formal demand to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.798" offset="12766542">Now both courts below considered this claim of a lack of a formal demand and concluded that in the circumstances of this case, the demand would be vital and futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.505" offset="12825370">The Court of Appeals I thought I phrased it fairly well and I have been paraphrasing what they said, I cannot remember it offhand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.547" offset="12861524">They said that a demand here would really be a demand of that of a monopoly and this one is a powerful and persistent monopolist, would be a demand that a monopolist seized monopolizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.158" offset="12920038">I think they described such a notion as ironic any contention that is that under those circumstances, a demand should be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.509" offset="12965386">United brings in a very interesting notion in its so called cost of capital, claiming that cost of capital first and first claimers, I do not know which first or second, they have two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.102" offset="13011780">One, because the cost of capital Hanover faced -- would face, it would never buy the machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.281" offset="13040515">Secondly that in determining their damages the cost of capital should be determined and deducted from any award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.383" offset="13076877">The cost of capital is solely an economic concept and it maybe the concept to be cutting us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.959" offset="13111254">It was occasionally in the course of this not too short trial, a bit of humor would get in to the case and I remember that their expert cited as an authority to this cost of capital approach to a certain document, certain book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.193" offset="13176142">I was foolish enough to read the book and that incidentally the expert hadn't quite precise as to just what percentages should be applied to Hanover's so called cost of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.225" offset="13224312">When I read the book, I found that the author said that pen economists measured the cost of capital of IBM, they would have 10 answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.451" offset="13265168">And I asked him if he relied on this book and he said yes and I asked if he relied on that and he said “no, the authors were wrong there”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.161" offset="13295992">They were right only in the sense that it is an economic theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.820" offset="13306650">Of course it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.229" offset="13312293">It is a theory that is used by economists as a guide in deciding whether a certain investment might or might not be worthwhile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.561" offset="13353566">In no sense is it cost?</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.817" offset="13362657">In no accounting sense is it a cost?</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.720" offset="13374255">It is not a disbursement, it's not an item of an expense incurred in the course of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.195" offset="13400168">It is not reflected in the profit and loss statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.112" offset="13415842">But even under the theory, capital can be of two kinds, equity and borrow and the cost of capital that is being talked about here is cost of equity capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.294" offset="13468505">In the case of borrowings, the cost of capital is the interest rate and this is agreed to by the experts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.694" offset="13502151">Hanover has been held and in fact had a surplus of equity, had surplus of even of current assets, but Hanover for the purpose of its calculations assumed it would borrow the money so that its business will otherwise go on as it had gone in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.136" offset="13583966">And during the period of the so called supposed acquisitions, Hanover in fact paid the prime rate and this sounds like old times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.507" offset="13633390">The prime rate then was 1.5% to 2% and Hanover deducted it from its calculations pursuant to Judge Harry's direction, his direction 2.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.294" offset="13692531">Now if Hanover had any cost of capital that was it and it's fully accounted for in the calculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.918" offset="13723042">Hanover had no other cost of capital and certainly no cost of equity capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.100" offset="13751777">Both courts below considered this cost of capital theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.082" offset="13771734">Both rejected it, any other conclusion I submit would be ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.597" offset="13841742">As I said at the beginning and this suggests that I am coming to the end, there is no reason and this is our basic position that Hanover should be treated differently from any other treble-damage plaintiffs who relies on a decree in a prior government action that Hanover was damaged by United's monopolization cannot possibly be disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.011" offset="13963368">The District Court's decision held, it cost Hanover $1,413,000 more to lease the machines and it would have cost Hanover if it had rented it in free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.275" offset="14032436">And the District Court said and quite accurately and it is one of the short answers to all of United's contention,”by this monopolization Hanover was aimed at and hit.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.774" offset="14298467">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.400" offset="14316962">On behalf of United Shoe Machinery Corporation, appellant in number 463, appellee in number 335, I should like to present the case differently from the order of points and the detailed analysis that Your Honors will see in the brief in the form of a narration of what happened in the relations between the parties in order that you may see this points developed as we go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.098" offset="14471816">First however, I should like while the statements are fresh in Your Honors mind to emphasize two points, indeed concessions, that Mr. Hayes has made in the course of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.593" offset="14537749">The first statement to me remarkable and I wrote it down; we are not suing on the basis of refusal to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.053" offset="14583620">He goes on to say, “we are suing for damage due for monopolization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.372" offset="14608906">But what I ask Your Honors is the monopolization accept inability to buy and how are the damages computed except by comparing so called ownership costs with so called lease costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.591" offset="14689782">Why then does Hanover say it is not suing for refusal to sell because the courts below held a finding that is not contested that there was no demand?</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.608" offset="14753834">Now the second interesting point which Mr. Hayes made which is basic to his argument is the point that the tax decision of the Court of Appeals is wrong because it charges Hanover with taxes or the effect of income taxes on the judgment of the damages it has proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.552" offset="14901582">I think I am right in saying that Mr. Hayes argued that that is wrong, that the Court of Appeals wrongly pursued the theory of Hanover having a choice, the choices of fiction, and that since it had no choice, and because of inability to buy, Hanover could not be charged with income tax savings in the course of the assumed purchased operation or put it in the words of Hanover's last brief in number 335 the blue brief, the Court of Appeals in espousing in a fiction of choice was espousing a self destructive argument and one that automatically abolished the possibility of damage.</text>

I know no situation, I can conceive of none where a lessee who has leased without protest for here 16 years in fact 55 years and has benefited from the use of the machines very, very handsomely and is never has to buy them has yet recovered an award on the basis that it would have bought them and if that is to be done, I think that any court and I assume Your Honors would if that comes in that comfortable form, any court would have to say what the Court of Appeals said here as to taxes, “calculations must include those elements which a business corporation would necessarily consider in choosing between the two alternatives”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.977" offset="16227244">Now, if Hanover, no monopoly in what Mr. Hayes calls a free market, if Hanover had as they testified, they would have like to bought the United machines and that is the theory of the recovery here, they would have lost the benefit of the annual tax savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.507" offset="16321390">They would have gotten certain benefits in the way of a temporary deduction for the money paid out on the purchase.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph M. Carson</label>
            <text syncTime="4235.764" offset="17046444">I think Mr. Hayes will agree with me that there was a slip of the tongue which he corrected and the income tax point was argued and taken up and accepted by Court of Appeals on reasoning which I will not reiterate because it seems to us unexceptional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.896" offset="17110915">Now, it seems to us Your Honor that this case which we beg to leave to characterize in its result except as corrected by the Court of Appeals, a gross miscarriage of justice, this case presents a number of points that are rather remarkable in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.826" offset="17198686">In this case, to some of the points before I narrate the facts, you have a judgment based on a practice of leasing which was no injury to Hanover, but a benefit to it and which it testified was completely satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.295" offset="17264515">You have the absence of a demand to purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.498" offset="17277367">You have an underlying decree which I think I shall demonstrate did not condemn the lease only by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.397" offset="17312998">You have what the Judge Wyzanski himself characterized as a change in the law made retroactive by the District Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.432" offset="17357093">You have basic errors in the damage calculation that I have briefly mentioned and you have an ignoring of the statute of limitations, all adding up together to make what we think is a most unjust result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.291" offset="17408502">Now, with that background statement, let me tell the Court briefly from the record what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.448" offset="17437132">Hanover began as a small family company making shoes in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.413" offset="17456985">It was organized at the same time as United Shoe Corporation was organized, about 1900.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.015" offset="17483421">According to the complaint, the lease relationships between them date back to 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.158" offset="17507976">In fact, they undoubtedly date back much earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.385" offset="17528874">Hanover remained a small family company until 1956 after Judge Wyzanski's decree when for the first time in 1956 it issued some stock to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.732" offset="17582268">By 1960, having begun as a small family company, it was one of the 35 biggest and most prosperous shoe manufacturers in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.089" offset="17623751">Its profit rate regularly increased from 1939 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.814" offset="17642663">Its profit figures are shown at page 245 of the joint appendix and they show that from 35 to 55 for 20 years, they went up from about $300,000 before taxes to about $4 million before taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.101" offset="17719777">Now, this relationship with United was partly the source of the prosperity at Hanover and the relationship as I say was continuous since at least 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.796" offset="17782575">It was in 1930 that the first case came before this Court on a criminal indictment by the United States based on the original constitution of the United as a combination of machinery companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.467" offset="17845269">And the dismissal of that indictment was supported by this -- was affirmed by this Court in an opinion by Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.330" offset="17900648">It is of some interest in view of our contention and Judge Wyzanski's conclusion that United's leasing practice has the approval of this Court from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.302" offset="17944534">It is of some interest Your Honor to note what the Solicitor General said in 1913 in presenting his first claim under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.211" offset="17984240">He said, “This case presents the question of whether it's legal to gather together into one corporation about 80% of all the interstate trade in some particular line of activity when it is done gradually by legitimate methods and without any unfair competition such as characterized to Tobacco and Standard Oil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.342" offset="18064697">If that is legal, the sooner the business world understands it, the better”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.466" offset="18085282">On that particular case which does not involve the propriety of the leases, this Court held the conduct of United was legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.397" offset="18128959">To resume the record of United up until 1953, Judge Wyzanski in his careful review of 40 years of behavior of this defendant held that there had no exhibited no predatory practices, no monopoly profits and there had been developed in the language of the Court of Appeals an approval of the leasing policy in various forms by three successive decisions of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.443" offset="18273155">This was 1913 that I first referred to in this Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.423" offset="18293112">In 1918 the lessees themselves were attacked in a Bill in equity that came before this Court in 247 of the United States, and there was a division of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.896" offset="18346924">The charge was a violation of the Sherman Act, both Sections 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.815" offset="18366673">And there Your Honors, we will find a sharp division between Mr. Hayes and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.204" offset="18388198">Mr. Hayes has said in downright terms that decision had nothing to do with the approval of United's leasing practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.306" offset="18420590">I ask Your Honors to read the opinions both of Justice McKenna and the dissent of Justice Day and to see as I read the words that the question of whether or not the leases coerced shoe manufacturers was taken up and disposed off and the Court held they were not, that the leases were not coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.528" offset="18517452">Mr. Hayes' language was carefully selected and I owe it to him to say that what he really asserted in this Court was that the prior decisions of the Supreme Court did not deal with the exact practices that Judge Wyzanski dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.031" offset="18595506">That is true, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.271" offset="18608462">In 1922 as he said, the leases were altered because of the third decision of this Court under the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.803" offset="18638555">Tying causes were taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.855" offset="18646810">A 17-year term was changed to a 10-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.722" offset="18662275">All this with complete silence and acquiescence from Hanover.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.607" offset="18681814">The leases were deformed and the leasing practice went on but what I call this Court's attention to is that the gravamen of the Hanover case is what is called lease only, that is to say inability to buy certain groups of machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.992" offset="18755375">The gravamen of Hanover's case as I shall demonstrate is not the four restrictive causes that Judge Wyzanski condemned in 1953 that I will mention in a moment, the gravamen is the continuance of leasing only for the distribution of the more important, more productive and more lucrative shoe machines such as Hanover used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.910" offset="18843042">Now what my point Your Honors is that throughout the Clayton Act case in 1923, the Sherman Act case in 1918 and the Sherman criminal case in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.306" offset="18904586">That practice of lease only was constant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.860" offset="18922768">In none of those cases was the -- none of those situations where shoe manufacturers in the situation described by the Courts were they able to buy the machines that was then distributed on lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.744" offset="18998314">It fair to say that the Court did not discuss that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.363" offset="19016808">None of the three judgments of this Court discussed whether or not inability to buy was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.383" offset="19052857">I do not think Judge Wyzanski held inability to buy a constitutional violation and I note that Mr. Hayes says we do not base our case on refusal to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.272" offset="19096430">But it is very obvious, is it not, that in the second of those cases 247 US when the divided members of the Court discussed whether or not the existing leases then more honorous were coercive of shoe makers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.459" offset="19173230">The majority said they were not and they had in mind -- must have in mind that there was no alternative in the way of purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.324" offset="19208652">And we have put in our brief some very interesting language of the three-judge court in Massachusetts which discussed in considerable detail with approval, the leasing policy so far as concerned shoe manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.574" offset="19273644">Now, we are dealing here with Hanover, but I felt it necessary to lay this background prior to judicial approval of the United leasing practice that is a lease only business because Judge Wyzanski said in his opinion which you have all read, United leasing practices were never condemned but were in part endorsed by the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5014.384" offset="20160867">There is a question whether the government decree was properly a basis for the judgment, for the particular judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.244" offset="20196394">I am talking about the retroactivity, so called retroactivity point in any treble-damage case which supports your position?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_m_carson" startTime="5032.341" stopTime="5799.108">
            <label>Mr. Ralph M. Carson</label>
            <text syncTime="5032.341" offset="20232756">I do not know any treble-damage case where the retroactivity point arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.390" offset="20256893">And that is why Your Honor, I have taken time to recite the unique record of judicial approval of the lease only policy by this Court and by all courts until in 1953, Judge Wyzanski changed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.877" offset="20318856">That is why I have taken the time to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.528" offset="20329514">Perhaps I should in view of Your Honor's question addressed myself what maybe on the Courts mind as to the effect of a reversal here on other treble-damage cases because Mr. Hayes has gone so far as to say that if our contentions are correct, no person injured by an antitrust violation can recover with respect to the past, the antitrust violation is corrected only prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.839" offset="20430764">Now of course we do not make any such contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.583" offset="20441736">Let me direct myself to Clause 4 of the Decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.884" offset="20458872">The Decree Your Honors is in the bound volume of the joint appendix and in that Judge Wyzanski said the leases are unduly restrictive in that, you find the page in the decree, in that they have as 10-year term which is too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.461" offset="20549256">They have a repair service without extra charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.577" offset="20569631">They have a full capacity clause and they impose return charges on the return of the machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.408" offset="20597008">Now he analyzed all those in relation to the keeping out of competition of shoe machinery manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.561" offset="20633579">He did not have before him the claims of any private parties, but he did have the claim of the United States in paragraph 61 of the complaint, among the offenses charged said paragraph 61, as United has declined to sell its most important machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.040" offset="20727515">Now that was dismissed in the clause of the decree which dismisses on the merits all other matters than these four clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.887" offset="20770879">And it would seem to me that the drift of Your Honor's question as the effect on treble-damages, other cases would be, did these four clauses which the judge condemned injure Hanover?</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.500" offset="20817377">It is perhaps an oversight in our briefs, we didn't even discussed that question because it was never claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.667" offset="20842036">The only injury ever claimed was the inability to buy which resulted in assertedly excessive leasing charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.342" offset="20876727">But let me go back to these four.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.511" offset="20889370">The 10-year term by 1939 when limitations begins, all the older machines were on a five-year renewal basis and as to new ones, there was a free right of return, cutting the 10-year down to any period of the lessee he wished because United have its own volition that created what is called a right of deduction fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.290" offset="20984560">The right of deduction fund was made up out of royalties paid by the particular lessee and credited to it and used to pay return charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.551" offset="21021550">Now as to shoe machinery makers, Judge Wyzanski said this is a restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.442" offset="21045164">It keeps out competitors, but as to shoe manufacturers like Hanover, it is a benefit and the 10-year term never affected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.072" offset="21087692">Hanover testified at page 301 of the record that it never had to pay a return charge for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.711" offset="21114232">Second, the free repair service is charged as a restrictive practice that kept out shoe machinery makers, but as to Hanover, it was a benefit because the lessees required Hanover to repair the machines at its own expense and United did it at its expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.324" offset="21192704">And while the Court found that Hanover paid for this service in paying lease charges, the Court also found that this lease charges were reasonable and I cite pages 51, 61, 100 and 189 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.676" offset="21262085">Third, the full capacity clause, which was held that the restrictive devices against competitors, Mr. Sheppard of Hanover testified it was never enforced against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.200" offset="21308165">And fourth, the return charges on the return of the machines, they were never paid by Hanover because of its continuing credit in this voluntarily created right of deduction fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.333" offset="21360724">So as regards the impact of our contention on any other treble-damage cases that may come before the Court, we say that giving full effect to the adjudication that Judge Wyzanski made, Hanover didn't try to bring itself within it and in other cases, the violation is found for the past but of course people injured would be entitled to claim on the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.365" offset="21484857">But there again, I think Your Honors would be interested in the fact that not only did Hanover never complained of being unable to buy until this suit was filed in September 1955, but Hanover expressed positive satisfaction with the leasing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.104" offset="21575764">As it chanced, the defendant brought before Judge Wyzanski on his trial, a number of shoe manufacturers testified that the satisfactory character of the lease only system without particular regard to these four objectionable clauses but whether they would prefer to buy rather than to lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.436" offset="21669073">And somewhat to the disbelief of Judge Wyzanski, all the 13 whose testimony is cited at page 14 of our main brief in number 463, all 13 who were produced, testified, no they like leasing, they would rather lease than buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.085" offset="21735737">Of course a great advantage of leasing Your Honors is that it puts all this competitors at the same footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.539" offset="21761546">The charges are uniform and above all as Judge Wyzanski himself said, “Small companies like Hanover that are beginning, have no capital, can get full equipment of machinery by just paying the monthly charge”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.531" offset="21829465">Now, Mr. Sheppard, president of Hanover, was going to be asked to testify among those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.291" offset="21860498">As it happened, he was not called.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.022" offset="21871470">The testimony was getting accumulated, but the record is very clear as to what he said in an interview which my senior partner Mr. Kendall had with him Sheppard in 1950 concerning the leasing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.662" offset="21934059">I cite the record page 335, Mr. Sheppard was very pro United Shoe and the only thing about the leases which he did not like was the fact that it allowed competition to hurt him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.225" offset="21984319">He said the only objection I have to leasing is the fact that you lease everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.100" offset="22007724">He said directly on the record United's control of shoe manufacturers is a lot of nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.010" offset="22031444">He said quoted by a person at the interview, “His big objection against the leasing system was that it caused too many competitors for his company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.602" offset="22069791">So carrying this story which I have endeavored, treat chronologically, down to 1953, you have a situation where Hanover had prospered in the use of the leases, had never claimed the right to purchase and was not in fact affected as the direct object of the monopoly which monopoly was directed against United's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.778" offset="22194448">Certainly normal that the monopolization giving United a control of the shoe machinery market would exclude shoe machinery manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.753" offset="22242408">Now, the fact the other competitors like the Campbell Shoe Machinery and other producers, leased their machines exclusively, that leasing was traditional in the business, that it had been going on since the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.766" offset="22310431">All that of course did not save United from the restrictive effects of these four clauses which kept out the competitors, but these four clauses did not affect Hanover.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.216" offset="22368214">Now, I must hurry on and I think perhaps I had better get for just a moment to passing on since Mr. Hayes mentioned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.386" offset="22408965">I thought I might leave it to the briefs because it is after all largely a matter of interpreting the cases, but I think I can sum up by saying the word injury in the Clayton Act has been treated differently by different courts with respect to whether the plaintiff is a middle man or a consumer of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.603" offset="22501752">It is a middle man, the court still say in the cases that are cited, is passing on the alleged excess cost gives him no cause of action, but it is the consumer who uses shoe machinery then says the court said it's different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.066" offset="22563610">Even though he passed on the excess cost, he is still injured because as Mr. Hayes reminds you the theory of Justice Holmes in a railroad and not an antitrust case is the first impact is what counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.677" offset="22626095">That does not seem logical and it does not seem to be consonant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.407" offset="22645008">With Your Honors' decision in the AMEC case cited in our brief, a tax case that where plaintiff has transferred the obligation he undertook, he no longer has a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.316" offset="22700596">But as the cases now shaped, the passing on defense is very different from it has been in any other case before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.991" offset="22743333">Because the courts below did hold despite what Mr. Hayes said and our brief gives the references that the lease terms and rental rates between the parties were reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.611" offset="22801847">The District Court refused to find them unreasonable and in other comments, the District Court said granted that they are reasonable and leases are lawful the defendant is still liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.232" offset="22848345">The leases then were alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.201" offset="22860152">They are not objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.442" offset="22865168">It's inability to but that is objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.477" offset="22877288">Now, when you come to the inability to buy, what the plaintiff has done is to total up, to fabricate, to total up the so called purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.228" offset="22912293">That purchase price certainly could not be asserted before 1955 when the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.549" offset="22937579">In fact it was only calculated in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.578" offset="22949700">That perhaps makes no difference, but I point out to the Court that in year after year during the 16 years of this alleged violation, Hanover not only was making up profit year by year after paying the $0.8 of per lease charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.185" offset="23016155">But according to a stipulation that is in the record and cited in our brief, in making this profit, it calculated the cost in which it put in the cost of shoe machinery so that by the time the suit was filed, Hanover had been completely paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.820" offset="23086686">This is the first time passing on has come before this Court since Justice Brandeis intimated in the Kiel case back in 1922 that it might be valid defense and that was an antitrust case, cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.143" offset="23147917">I think it is high time if this issue comes to be determinated that the Court recognize the equity of not allowing a satisfied lessee who has been indemnified out of his resale prices to victimize the defendant with a treble-damage charge which is not an injury because at the time of the lease payments the transactions were lawful according to the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.386" offset="23260871">Another point which is dealt with a great deal in the briefs, but I believe I now have a shorter --</text>

            <text syncTime="5852.369" offset="23512900">Of course Judge Goodrich says maybe they could have bought more leather.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.149" offset="23531917">I don't see that that's a connected proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.614" offset="23549785">What I was coming, I don't know if I have answered Your Honor's question, what I was coming to say was to simplify the calculating -- the damage calculation point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.137" offset="23587924">I think Mr. Hayes has given me the opening that I require.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.643" offset="23621987">I cannot of course involve this Court in the details of an elaborate calculation the District Court went through.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.700" offset="23658141">Hanover has attached as an appendix to its brief the written description by Judge Sheridan who was certainly very patient about the matter as to how he saw the damage calculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.745" offset="23714356">Now, this written description, I criticize in two particulars that I have already adverted to and that I recall to Your Honors as determinating, the tax benefit of the lease payments actually made and the cost of capital consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5926.921" offset="23811009">Now the cost of capital is defined by the District Court as the rate of return which investors expect on the money they put in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.076" offset="23843715">And the conception is that if Hanover spends a million dollars buying shoe machinery, it's a lost of money unless it makes out of that shoe machinery what the return has to be put to investors on the million dollars that they have put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5953.809" offset="23918634">The concept is described abundantly in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.548" offset="23933576">The only thing that both Judge Sheridan and Mr. Hayes have criticized about it is what I freely admit that the cost of capital could be computed different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.082" offset="23983731">But that there is such an item as cost of capital to be taken into account in a fair comparison Your Honors of leasing versus ownership is agreed by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.422" offset="24033050">In fact, I would like to emphasize what the briefs should bring out that when Hanover purchased used shoe machinery from United pursuant to the decree and the prices of this machinery were worked out in negotiations between shoe manufacturers as a group and United.</text>
            <text syncTime="6005.138" offset="24123956">Each side had an economist Dr. Joel Dean and Dr. Robert Anthony, and each economist said, “In reaching this price, we have got to compute the cost of capital for the entire group”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.842" offset="24186755">Dean said it was 10%. Anthony said it was 18%. I only cite this to illustrate that it is an item that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.808" offset="24226565">And if you're going to look at purchase versus lease contemporaneously when Hanover had to make the decision which I would say is the only fair way to look at it, you would have to look at it at the time the decisions were supposititiously made that is 39, 40, 41 and so on when Hanover actually leased, but now it says, it would have liked to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.622" offset="24333876">Now as it happens, the arithmetical consequences of the two methods are laid out clearly in exhibits before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6066.177" offset="24368044">There are three or four of these great exhibits so called the lightest of calculations made by statisticians on assumptions of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.164" offset="24403989">They omit taxes and cost of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.864" offset="24418826">And there are on the other side, our calculations which include them and those are exhibits 48, 51 and 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="6090.998" offset="24467414">Only the first two, I am sorry to say, are reprinted in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.901" offset="24486954">And the allowance for these two items on the basis of contemporaneous choice shows uncontestably that purchase would have cost $949,000 more than leasing did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6110.173" offset="24544110">And that of course is why as I would assume, Hanover was content to lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="6116.577" offset="24569710">Now this approach does not rest exclusively on my I say so as an advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.826" offset="24598653">I cite the statement of Hanover's expert at page 562 of the record where he said “Is it your point that the lightest of calculations and those are the plaintiff's calculations omitting cost of capital, etcetera, the lightest of calculations were not documents which would be presented to management in order to decide whether to buy or to lease”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.148" offset="24703979">“Oh, definitely not” he says.</text>

            <text syncTime="6183.792" offset="24838562">This is the plaintiffs' expert Richard M. Syrt, I would heartily endorse the notion of introducing taxes on making a decision on preparing data for management to make a decision as to whether they should purchase or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="6308.021" offset="25335411">You got a total and he has compared it with a single purchase price.</text>

            <text syncTime="6722.025" offset="26991470">And Judge Wyzanski himself thought that you had approved it and Judge Wyzanski dismissed the clause in the government's complaint paragraph 61 which attacked the refusal to sell, but I go further.</text>

            <text syncTime="6755.857" offset="27126784">In view of that, we asked Judge Wyzanski in exercise of his reserved jurisdiction of the government case to amend or interpret his own decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.766" offset="27170461">Hanover appeared and opposed and the government counsel, being the government case appeared.</text>

            <text syncTime="6789.000" offset="27259382">But he said, have you not considered the practice that the Supreme Court approves in Erie against Tompkins case of certifying the question from the Treble Damage Court to the Antitrust Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6807.306" offset="27332629">In the course of that colloquy, Judge Wyzanski had before him as I said government counsel and the interesting colloquy which he had with government counsel appears on pages 19 and 21 of our brief and it is in the record and not to read too long because you have it all before you, Judge Wyzanski made this arresting remark addressed to government counsel who under the rule of the AMEC case was the party entitled to enforce the estoppel that Hanover would enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6840.743" offset="27466376">The Judge said at page 20 “Now that you are here, are you not aware from being here on previous occasions that the government never contended and I never ruled as Judge Sheridan supposes the matter was decided.”</text>
