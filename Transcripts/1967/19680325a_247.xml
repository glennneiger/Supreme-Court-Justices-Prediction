            <text syncTime="26.438" offset="209168">Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.620" offset="225886">This matter is before this Court on a certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.868" offset="250859">The subject matter is the Medicine Creek Treaty of 1854.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.856" offset="274787">This is a Treaty that was entered into between the United States Government and the Puyallup Indians, the Nisqually Indians and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.811" offset="310627">The primary issue that is before the Court as we see them is first of all, can the State of Washington, in the exercise of its police power, pass and enforce such fishing regulations so as to effectively repeal that provision in the Medicine Creek Treaty that guaranteed to these Indians the fishing right.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.952" offset="415222">The second question is do the Courts of the State of Washington have jurisdiction to determine this matter in such case where they have not obtained the consent of the Indians or the consent of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.540" offset="489514">I think, in order to get a little more to my point, I'm going to take short five, six minutes to cover the backgrounds and facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.320" offset="524622">In this particular case, when the Medicine Creek Treaty was negotiated with the various, the tribes, the Puyallup Tribe and the Nisqually Tribe, the Indians relinquished to the United States Government thousands of acres of land upon which were very valuable timber lands and in turn, the Indians reserved to themselves the right to fish and in addition, they also reserved a small piece of land that they picked as a reservation at the mouth of the Puyallup river and I would like to point out that the picking of the reservation at the point like many other Indians up and down the coast, they selected that not because of accident, but by necessity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Knodel</label>
            <text syncTime="175.937" offset="807163">Well, there has been a war between the Indians and the settlers actually and in consideration of everybody living peacefully and giving up this conflict that had been going on, the Indians agreed that they would step out of this large area of land and relinquish it to the United States and they would go on a red reserve or reservation where the United States would guarantee their peaceful existence and out of this reservation, they could then exercise this particular fishing right.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.539" offset="1013530">Yes, it is a federal statute or it's probably more than that if the Worcester versus Georgia case gave the same effect to Indian Treaties as it did to foreign treaties although I realize that we have a little different situation here considered, but it is a genuine Treaty that was executed by the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.997" offset="1099316">Governor Stevens is a man who engineered it for the United States and the Indians, of course signed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.275" offset="1152502">Yes, the Puyallupians, as was testified by the State's anthropologist, Doctor Tiller, the Indians were on living in this area, Puyallup area, for 500 hundred years before the Medicine Creek Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.808" offset="1210598">They were using various fishing gear and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.294" offset="1228570">I think the important provision of the Treaty is the fish, of course, because this is what the Indians were really bargaining for.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.570" offset="1253648">This is what they were really working for, hold negotiations with this and the record would show, as testified, the minutes, the Treaty itself shows that the fish were the main item of bargain and the reason it was because these Indians had to have a fish to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.920" offset="1327104">Had, this Treaty left out the provision of the right to obtain and abandon the supply of fish, we would not be before this Court because the Indians would've starved to death.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.357" offset="1544756">We maintain that under the Medicine Creek Treaty, we were given this Treaty right to fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.408" offset="1568998">And what has happened in this case is, the -- if I'll point this out to the Court, I think it will better answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.815" offset="1606614">There'd been quite a number of impacts upon this fish that was not anticipated originally when the Medicine Creek Treaty was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.856" offset="1642768">The indirect impacts, for example, the Puyallup River has a lot of its spawning grounds destroyed, manmade obstructions had been placed in their and also pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.399" offset="1688952">Then, there has been since this that the Indians could not anticipate and all matters brought about the state is a tremendous commercial and sports fishery upon this group of, this fish run that the Indians depend upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.952" offset="1751228">The salmon is a fish that will hatch in river and then it will proceed out to the ocean and then it will return to its spawning grounds and there the Salmon dies, of course, except the steelhead doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.673" offset="1802115">What happened in this case to get to your question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.892" offset="1818937">After the salmon leaves the Puyallup River after its -- avoided all these ruinous indirect impacts and goes off to sea and then returns from the ocean after it's been exposed to the various natural hazards, been exposed to the international fisheries, the Japanese, Russian and Canadian Fisheries, and it come down from through here and at that particular point, they come into, I guess you could call it “Washington State waters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="457.247" offset="1932309">What happens is you then have three competing groups for that particular fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.156" offset="1947982">You have the Washington State Commercial Group, which is the largest taking group, the sports fish regroup and the Treaty Indian fishing group.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.935" offset="1995107">What has happened in this case now is quite obviously in order to keep this run going, you've got to get a certain number of fish up the river to spawn so they can repeat this particular cycle.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.426" offset="2045053">Now, in this particular case, as these fish move down, in the State of Washington, in its program what they call “conservation”, they allowed the fish for the sportsmen and fish for the commercial interest and by the time the fish get down here to what they call the way down in the corner right of mouth of the Puyallup River and going into the mouth of the river, the State of Washington says: “In the interest of conservation, we can't let the Indians have one single fish because we must take all of the fish” and in this case, what they did, the State cast rules and regulations that prohibited any type of net fishery in this particular river and right in the mouth of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.220" offset="2312234">Yes, but we want -- our argument is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.015" offset="2327385">Let more fish escape so we have fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.722" offset="2338252">Don't practice conversation on the Indians, conservation for the commercial interest and the sports interest leaving the Indians out.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.229" offset="2368240">Now, the federal court interpreting this very point, our federal points out in the west coast, they applied what they call the indispensable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.873" offset="2406902">The State Court in this particular case applied the reasonable necessary test.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.320" offset="2428635">They said obviously, it's reasonable and necessary that by that time the fish escapes all these various hazards and get down to this particular point, then they have to go up the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.203" offset="2472208">In the Umatilla case, Maison versus Umatilla case determined by the Ninth Circuit said, “Before you start regulating this Treaty Indian fishing right, and there they interpret a very similar treaty provision, Medicine Creek Treaty was one of the first of the series of treaties involving similar type of people and similar situation and what they did in that case, they said: “You can't start on the other end and say, you're not going to leave any fish for the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.507" offset="2577429">You've got to first of all show that the rules and regulations you are applying are indispensable”.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.104" offset="2603760">In other words, it's my understanding of the Umatilla case, which makes sense, the Indians had bargained and this was principle essence of that Treaty that we would get an abundant supply of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.286" offset="2652557">Now, the fish we were taking, just so the record is clear, out of these competing group of individuals, the Washington Commercial Group, Washington Sports Group and the Treaty Indian Groups, out of that catch, the total catch, we get 3% to 5%, that's all we were taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.376" offset="13724923">Now this Court has never decisively ruled on the particular issue presented by this case, but it has in a number of case and that particularly the Winans case, recognized that when these Treaties were made, the Indians did enjoy and were guaranteed a somewhat special right even though it was to be a right in common, it was a somewhat special right which was of a different nature than that which the ordinary citizen of the territory would enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.307" offset="13840593">And I think really the problem which this case presents is one of determining where the burden of conservation should be placed in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.792" offset="13894510">I think you have to the outset concede that neither the Indians in 1854 or the representatives of the federal government that time anticipated that things would develop to a point where it would be necessary to impose conservation restrictions on the amount of fish that could be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.955" offset="13983222">But I think a good starting point to determine how the burden of that conservation is to be apportioned has to be the conditions that existed at the time the Treaty was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.948" offset="14047169">Now, there is testimony in the record in the Puyallup case by Doctor Teller, who was an anthropologist and it appears at pages 184, 185 of the record, in which he sets forth and stated that at the time this Treaty was entered into, there was no commercial fishing of any significance in this area except that of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.476" offset="14165243">The Indians did fish and they fish not only for their own subsistence but also for fish which they then bartered with people down the coast and with settlers down the coast and with the Hudson Bay Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.872" offset="14230862">Indeed, in the archives there is a letter of Governor Stevens to the Commissioner of Indians Affairs, talking about this provision in this particular Treaty and unfortunately, we have not set it out in our Brief but I can, I'm sure, obtain copies and would submit them to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.287" offset="14308498">For I think it's significant what Governor Stevens who would negotiated this Treaty with the Indians had to say about the nature of the fishing and the rights of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.998" offset="14347368">I'm talking about the Indians of Puget Sound is that they form a very considerable proportion of the trade of the Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.310" offset="14372655">Many are good laborers and are employed in families, vessels, lumber yards, lumber mills and on farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.283" offset="14396479">They catch most of our fish, supplying not only our people with clams and oysters but salmon to those who pure and export it what they call small patches of potatoes, their principal food is fish and roots and berries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.096" offset="14459800">Then it goes out to say, the provisions as to reserves, as to taking of fish, pasturing animals and gathering roots and berries had strict reference to their conditions as above.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.109" offset="14515806">So it's clear that at the time that this particular Treaty was entered into, the Indians were engaged in commercial fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.456" offset="14553213">They were in fact the only people in this area engaged in commercial fishing and they -- this provision was inserted in the Treaty to protect their right, to continue to engage in commercial fishing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3655.899" offset="14726980">I think the clear answer today is that a large commercial fishery has grown out in the Puget Sound and in the higher State of Washington and it is the taking of these fish by the commercial fishermen, not the taking of fish by the Indians which requires the imposition of conservation measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.583" offset="14817677">One of the exhibits, I understand at the Court below was a Washington State of Department of Fisheries Report, the 73rd Annual Report and this is the year 1963, which I take it was the most recent available at that time and in that report, there are statistics as to the number of fish taken by the commercial fisheries and the number of fish taken by the Indians an it is clear from that report, for example on the State of Washington as a whole, there were in the year 1963 9,311,763 salmon taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.280" offset="14960515">Of that total fish, 815,000 were taken by Indians. Similarly with regards to Puget Sound, that area alone again the total fish taken was 7,608,434 where the Indians again took less than 10% of that, taking 658,394.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.678" offset="15062079">So it seems that the need for conservation has arisen.</text>

            <text syncTime="4643.950" offset="18679202">The State of Idaho, like for example, has taken the position that they have no right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.172" offset="18692054">This Treaty guarantees the Indians an absolute right to fish and the Supreme Court in the State and so there was a problem existing which hopefully will be solved by this Court's decision in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.970" offset="18755271">But the Secretary, in trying to work out some of these difficulties, the Secretary, I think, recognized among other things that no existing Indians should be permitted to fish in such a way that will destroy the runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.032" offset="18815457">Even assuming that non-Indians didn't have the right, there is an obligation on the Secretary's part to conserve this asset, even if it's an Indian asset for future generations of Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="4709.146" offset="18940008">I think the Secretary has somewhat -- his regulations might come within the same type of power.</text>

            <text syncTime="5789.349" offset="23260766">At the time that this complaint was drafted and filed pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, injunctive relief was sought on behalf, on the part of the Department of Fisheries, the Department of Game in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="5805.551" offset="23325550">The theory of the case is simply that we are asking for a declaration of what rights, privileges or immunities, if any, that these petitioners possessed by virtue of the “Usual and accustomed language in their complaint”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.330" offset="23392737">As I'm sure the Court has aware at this time, salmon fishing is one of the most important natural resources that we have and we are fortunate enough to have in the Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.401" offset="23436936">Salmon fishing not only supports one of our major industries, commercial fishing but also attracts unnumbered thousands of sports fishermen who angle for these fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.207" offset="23492211">All of he conservation measures which are enacted into law by the legislature of the State of Washington or by virtue of regulations promulgated pursuant to the State Administrative Procedures Act are directed towards the goal of returning a sufficient number of adult salmon to the spawning beds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.835" offset="23578728">State regulation of non-Indians fishing has frankly achieved this goal by virtue of these comprehensive regulations which are placed upon the time, the manner, the fishing as well as the areas in which either commercial or sports fishing may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5887.476" offset="23653230">In recent years and by recent years, I've specified the year 1953, various Indian Tribes in the State of Washington in addition to the Nisquallies and the Puyallups have begun to move off from their reservations unto the various rivers and streams of the State and engage in commercial net fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.936" offset="23747166">The usual type of gear which has been employed and which in fact was employed, as the record shows in the Puyallup case, is what is called “monofilament set nets”.</text>
