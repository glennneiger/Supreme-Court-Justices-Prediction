            <label>Mr. Marvin E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="46.514" offset="291464">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.443" offset="307242">The issue in this case is where a consonant with the religious clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.941" offset="341201">The State of New York may furnish textbooks purchased with tax raised funds for use in religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.659" offset="388012">The material facts in the case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.942" offset="409224">Prior to 1965, Section 701 of the New York Education law, authorized local school boards to purchase textbooks and either to loan or sell them to pupils in the public schools in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.248" offset="470455">In 1965, the provisions relating to textbooks in Section 701 were amended effective September 1, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.136" offset="517998">The effect of the amendment was to turn a permissive practice into a mandatory one and to extend the coverage of the law to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.715" offset="564287">Under the law as amended, each school board in New York must purchase and long free of charge to all children residing in its district enrolled in a grade from 7 through 12 of an accredited public or private school any textbook requested by the child so long as the textbook was one designated for use in any public school in the state or by any school board in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.264" offset="694481">As originally enacted, the law contained no limit on the number of books required to be purchased and no limit on the amount of money that had to be spent for the books by the local school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.457" offset="743278">It did however provide for state reimbursement or state allocation to the extent of $10.00 a pupil.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.538" offset="791552">In the view of the East Greenbush School Board which had children residing in its district who were enrolled in grade 7 through 12 accredited private religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.784" offset="868561">The provisions of Section 701 as amended violated both the New York State Constitution and the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution both of which each member had sworn to uphold.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.264" offset="926448">Failure to implement the law on a part of this board would have subjected the members a removal from office and also would have subjected the school district to a loss of state funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.543" offset="975559">To resolve this conflict, the Greenbush School Board filed an action in the Supreme Court Albany County.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.620" offset="1011921">The relief sought in the complaint was a judgment declaring the Textbook Law to the extent that related to church schools unconstitutional and in violation to both the New York State Constitution on the First amendment to the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.237" offset="1078376">It also sought an order in joining the State Commissioner of Education from implementing the provisions of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.267" offset="1178478">After the suit was filed and the suit incidentally was filed April 29, 1966 which is about four month before the law was to go into effect, after the suit was filed, the Textbook Law was further amended in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.854" offset="1236888">The first respect was to reduce the financial book on the local school boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.916" offset="1253083">The second respect was to define a textbook as used in the statute to mean a book which a student is required to use as a text for a semester or more in a school he legally attends.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.143" offset="1354021">The state answered the complaint, did not raise any material issue of fact but did deny the allegations relating to the unconstitutionality of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.321" offset="1390696">The state also raised a number of affirmative offenses, principal one of which was that the Greenbush School Board lacks standing to sue on the ground that it was an instrumentality of the state and could not challenge State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.205" offset="1446285">After issue was joined, five parents of children who resided in the East Greenbush School Board were permitted to intervene in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.892" offset="1477005">In their answer, they too did not raise any material issue of fact but did deny the allegations of unconstitutionality of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.723" offset="1504277">And in addition, they raised a number of affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.536" offset="1519532">The thrust of these defenses was that to deny the books to them and their children while permitting the furnishing of these books to pupils attending private nonsectarian schools constituted an interference with the free exercise of their religion and a denial of due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.894" offset="1624963">All parties then move for judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.436" offset="1647114">In substance, judgment on the pleading, they were in all affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.434" offset="1667176">At the time of oral argument, the Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 3 was joined as a party plaintiff and was deemed to have adopted all the pleadings in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.221" offset="1718272">The Supreme Court Albany County granted the plaintiff's cross-motion for judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.766" offset="1748470">It ruled that the Greenbush -- the two school boards had standing to sue, and also that the law as amended in 1965 and in 1966 violated the State Constitution and both the establishment of free exercise clauses of the Federal Constitution and a judgment was entered to that effect which among other things enjoined the state from implementing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.450" offset="1871245">An appeal was taken to the Appellant Division, third department.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.260" offset="1894442">Three of the justices constituting a majority of that court voted to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court Albany County and dismiss the complaint on the sole ground that the appellants lack standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.388" offset="1942925">Two remaining justices would have found that the appellants had standing and would have voted to reverse on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.559" offset="1979705">They would have found a law constitutional in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.681" offset="1996110">The case was then appealed to the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.658" offset="2012097">That court reached the merits of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.658" offset="2024009">It ruled that the appellants had standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.076" offset="2037697">And by a four-to-three vote, it ruled that the Textbook Law as amended did not violate State Constitution, did not violate the establishment clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.037" offset="2105616">Approximately 20 years ago, this Court for the first time defined the scope of the establishment clause's coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.668" offset="6584048">In the Everson case, which was decided by this Court 20 years ago, the Court defined the scope of the establishment clause as coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.468" offset="6619261">The definition consisted of seven sentences that appears at 330 US 15 and is quoted at page 10 of appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.222" offset="6674328">One of the sentences reads that no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions whatever they may be called or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.802" offset="6748620">While four justices in that case disagreed with the application of that definition to the facts of Everson, all of the justices agreed with the definition, and the definition has been repeated and reaffirmed at least three times, once unanimously until a Castle against Watkins in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.050" offset="6829599">In applying the Everson definition to the facts of the case, the majority started out by saying that state legislation should not be overturned if it was within the state's constitutional power even though it approached the verge of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.716" offset="6900234">Said on the one hand New Jersey could not, consistent with the establishment clause, contribute tax funds for the support of any religious institution which teaches the tenants in faiths of any church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.003" offset="6953420">Presumably here, it had in mind church schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.876" offset="6968884">On the other hand, New Jersey could not interfere with the free exercise of religion by their citizens such as by excluding believers or non-believers because of their faith or lack of it from the benefits of any welfare legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.091" offset="7033772">But the issue does pose it remained only for the majority there to determine the nature of the benefit, which was bus transportation, of where and how it was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.497" offset="7071389">And it determined that bus transportation was like certain other government services such as police and fire protection, sewage disposal, streets and highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.420" offset="7123111">The reason that it was no different than these other services the Court suggested was that it was separate and indisputably marked off from the primary function of the school, which was the teaching of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.550" offset="7175670">In other words, funds, tax funds were not being used by or within the confines of a religious institution in connection with functions associated with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.853" offset="7220809">Having determined that the funds -- that the benefit was marked off from the religious function, the Court concluded New Jersey did not support religion, although Justice Rutledge agreed to the definition of the scope of the establishment clause, he disagreed with the majority's conclusion that the busing law did not support religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.694" offset="7304192">For him, the primary reason children was sent to a church school was to obtain a religious education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.490" offset="7327389">The payment of transportation not only helped them get there and their parents to send them, but it aided them in this objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.986" offset="7353407">And any aid to religion was outlawed and was intended to be outlawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.631" offset="7383918">The dual prohibitions for Justice Rutledge to the first amendment made religion a private matter and it could not be made public by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.506" offset="7423415">The question of whether the tax funds or funds were raised for a public purpose was for him a false issue, clouding a real issue of the first amendment span.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.036" offset="7477541">In summary, Everson said as I read the case that busing or the providing of bus transportation approached the verge of New Jersey's constitutional power but that it was permissible because it was separate and marked off from the religious function of the church school.</text>

            <text syncTime="4718.838" offset="18980822">Picking up for a moment what Mrs. Coon has just said, the question that Mr. Justice Fortas has been concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.341" offset="19014781">The statute does not say specifically what kind of books they are to be but the statute has been conclusively construed by the Court of Appeals of New York as requiring secular textbooks and that interpretation arises out of the long history of New York under which public schools are not supposed to teach religion and are supposed to confine themselves to secular education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.285" offset="19134527">I must remind the Court also that this case comes here on an attack on the whole statute without regard to its administration, without regard to particular books, the position of opposing counsel is quite flat that this statute is bad on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.874" offset="19216865">It is so bad that no amount of good administration could make it better or save it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.487" offset="19243405">It is so bad that no amount of maladministration could make it worse and there is no distinction raised between this book and that book in our friend's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.139" offset="19285932">The attack is on all books and the secular definition comes out of the long experience of New York which is taken for granted that the public schools should not teach religion and should not buy religious books.</text>

            <text syncTime="4816.725" offset="19372345">That's right but the theme of this law is that the book that are to be provided are books uphold by public school authorities on the same standard that the public schools have been using for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.661" offset="19440055">Take the illustration that one of the other judges may have mentioned a particular school district, let us suppose somewhere, goes crazy and decides they want to put a course of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.145" offset="19493972">In the public schools and take a district where there is no private school in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.242" offset="19514347">The public school district decides, we will have religious courses in the public schools and they start ordering religious books.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.862" offset="19548829">That immediate result would be that any taxpayer in the district could stop it by a court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.733" offset="19572339">If you didn't like a court proceeding, you could stop it by an appeal to the Commissioner of Education and the Commissioner of Education has very broad powers of the school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.202" offset="19606194">He has not hesitated to use them in the field of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.213" offset="19618314">Let me give you a couple of instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.279" offset="19626569">The Commissioner of Education of New York on his own authority banned the on premises release time, religious education before this Court ever had the McCollum case following Engel versus Vitale, the Commissioner of Education took very strong action on so called religious practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.484" offset="19707340">He even forbid the use in the public schools of the last stanza of the Stars Spangled Banner when it was being sang under circumstances that gave it a religious rather than a patriotic connotation so that the idea that a particular school district is to act as a rubber stamp for parochial school and order all kinds of religious textbooks is an idea -- a divorce from reality and divorce from the practicality of the situation that any such action would be amount claim a piece of maladministration under the Act and it would be very instantly crack down upon by the Commissioner or by the New York courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="6757.597" offset="27135833">Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6761.226" offset="27150357">In this dissenting opinion in Everson, Justice Jackson set forth the cannonball of the church relating to Catholic schools by which all Catholics were bound so far as I know, these are still the cannonball of the church relating to church schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.216" offset="27218275">One of those cannons reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="6781.360" offset="27230814">Catholic children are to be educated at schools where not only nothing contrary to catholic faith and morals is thought but rather in schools where religious and world training occupy the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.713" offset="27304270">I like to comment too on something that Mrs. Coon said having to do with the pupil request under the statute of the pupil that requested the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="6810.396" offset="27347007">The way the statute is first written.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.870" offset="27368950">It did not contain the definition of textbooks and requested one would have to ask is what role can a 12-year-old play the selection of books which he's going to use it in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.754" offset="27416388">The way the statute read then, it would have to be argued that the student could go to the school board and ask for any book and any number of books so long as they were books designated for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.223" offset="27462363">But the statute was amended to make clear that the only book as student could request is one which is legally required to use as a text for a semester more in a school he legally attends making it absolutely clear that it is this school that is ordering the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="6863.766" offset="27560479">In conclusion, I would like to say briefly that there are many advocates of aide to parochial school who seek to further purely the religious objectives by masking their appeal for funds in the rectory for public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.621" offset="27635921">Thus, their appeals many times are wrapped in the mantle of the educational problem or poverty problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.874" offset="27664865">While no one would dispute the need for these programs, we must be careful not to sacrifice constitutional principles in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6902.374" offset="27714915">The principle in church and state separate has served this nation well attesting to the wisdom of those who fought hardest for its acceptance in our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6912.102" offset="27753785">It is part of our fabric not because we paid the lip service but because we continue to give it vitality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.429" offset="27783147">We should not permit the principle to be eroded by mouthing its words while stripping it of all significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.968" offset="27817315">I submit that this Court should rule that the furnishing of textbooks by the state of New York with funds raised by taxation constitutes a use of state funds to a religion in violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.892" offset="27913028">Thank you.</text>
