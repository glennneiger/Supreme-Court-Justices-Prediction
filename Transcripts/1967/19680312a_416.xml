            <text syncTime="29.024" offset="220536">Mr. Pfeffer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="31.181" offset="229104">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.225" offset="245300">This is a suit brought by a group of individual taxpayers residing in the City of New York challenging under both Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, the expenditure by the federal government funds to provide teaching services and textbooks and church related sectarian schools, the Government Act pursuant to which interpretation of the Elementary and Secondary Education Acts of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.233" offset="457310">Our suit was brought and the Government made a motion to dismiss on one ground and one ground only and that is since the plaintiffs were merely taxpayers, under the decision of this Court in Frothingham against Mellon, they did not have standing to challenge the Act and its administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.303" offset="569637">We cross moved for the convening of the three-judge courts and Justice Frankel granted our motion and referred to the three-judge court, the question of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.792" offset="627524">This was argued before the chief -- before the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.862" offset="643824">By a vote two to one, the Government's position was upheld and with the dissent by Judge Frankel and our complaint was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.313" offset="693666">The sole authority for the dismissal of this complaint, at this level anyway, is that we do not have standing to sue and as Frothingham constitutes barring to a suit by taxpayers, challenging federal expenditures of funds, alleged to be in violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.305" offset="785617">Now, the initial question which the -- which we address ourselves to and which the Government addresses itself to in its brief other than the technical question of the three-judge court which I presume the Government will argue, is whether Frothingham presents a constitutional barrier to a taxpayer's suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.762" offset="879449">It's our contention that unlike the companion suit of Massachusetts against Mellon, which may -- which we are willing to concede may have serve as a constitutional barrier to taxpayer suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.039" offset="940575">Frothingham was a decided on a party of judicial self-restraint statute rather than constitutional lack of capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.240" offset="985401">I must say that Mr. Justice Brandeis would not concur with my concession because according to Mr. Justice Brandeis, even Massachusetts against Mellon in which the State of Massachusetts brought the suit challenging expenditure, even that was not a case of constitutional lack of competence, but of abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.272" offset="1089473">In the classic concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Ashwander against T.V.A., he said, page 341 of 279 U.S., “the Court developed, for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.933" offset="1216115">They are at least of five of them, the fifth is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.682" offset="1235132">The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute by complaint of one who failed to show that he is injured by its operations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="291.519" offset="1270450">In Massachusetts against Mellon, the challenge of the Federal Maternity Act was not entertained, although made by the Commonwealth on behalf of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.042" offset="1308588">Now, Justice Brandeis was one of the Justices of the Court which decided Massachusetts and Frothingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.706" offset="1343175">He participated in the conference and presumably was in the position to know what the Court intended and according to Justice Brandeis, even Massachusetts does not represent a constitutional question under office but on the question of judicial self-restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.334" offset="1409735">However for the purpose of our case, we need not go that far and we urge that even if, even if Massachusetts interpret to represent a determination that a state had no constitutional power, for the Court has no constitutional power to hear a case by a state allegedly in behalf of its citizens, this does not apply to the Frothingham against Mellon which was decided simultaneously, but was an entirely separate and independent case by a taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.729" offset="1647344">I wonder if we shouldn't – I wonder if we shouldn't have that in our minds as we go along because that is a threshold case Mr. Pfeffer and that's a --</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="396.937" offset="1692170">Well, then turning to that question, for the first time, in its answering brief, not before Judge Frankel, not before the three-judge court nor the motion to dismiss or affirm, but for the first time in its answering brief, the Court asserts, the Government asserts that this case should have been heard by a single judge and therefore direct appeal is not proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.887" offset="1843994">Apparently, it's difficult for me fully to grasp the thrust of the Government's position, but apparently it appeared that it's that.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.544" offset="1894567">Our complaint asserts that the Commissioner of Education had misconstrued the statute and has interpreted to authorize the use of federal funds to finance education in parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.234" offset="1977323">However, in the alternative, if we are wrong and if the Commissioner did correctly interpret the statute, we assert that the statute to that extent was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.088" offset="2040748">The Government's position apparently is that we have pleaded in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.886" offset="2055899">Now we do not initially challenge the statute itself, but only its administration, a three-judge court is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.026" offset="2096546">I have examined carefully every single one of the decisions cited by the Government in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.914" offset="2128102">I have penalized every one of these in my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.324" offset="2145656">I find not a single case cited by the Government or elsewhere which supports that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.364" offset="2173868">On the contrary, I have cited at least five cases in which this Court has held that where you have all kinds of pleadings of this kind and assert first that the statute was not complied with or the governmental agency did not act in compliance with the statutory authority, but in the event it did, that the statute is valid and constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.251" offset="2281388">This Court has held that the three-judge court is the appropriate in direct appeal is the procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.138" offset="2316915">What case are you referring to?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="554.261" stopTime="588.789">
            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="554.261" offset="2321408">Well, I'm referring to the following cases, Allen against Grand Central Aircraft, 347 U.S. 535.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.871" offset="2355890">The latest case on this is Zemel against Rusk, 381 U.S. 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.133" offset="2376892">Also Florida Lime and Avocado Growers versus Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73 and Lee against Bickell of 1934, 292 U.S. 415 and Sterling against Constantin 287 U.S. 387.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="588.789" stopTime="603.824">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="588.789" offset="2459544">So what you're saying is that if this complaint had two causes of action have set forth the unconstitutional claim and the cause of action in a constitutional claim, you would have -- a three-judge court would have been required.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="603.824" stopTime="794.236">
            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="603.824" offset="2519730">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.437" offset="2526104">Now, the reason for that I think it's entirely logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.939" offset="2544180">Suppose we had not asserted that this -- the agency was acting beyond a statutory authority but had a simple one cause of action, the statute to the extent that it authorizes -- the statute is unconstitutional because it authorizes this expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.390" offset="2617950">Pursuant to the decisions of this Court consistently, this Court would have insisted from the first week question whether the agency did act in authority with the statute would not reach a constitutional issue if it could find that agency acted beyond its statutory authority in the case after case which I have I cited in my brief where the assertion was that the statute is unconstitutional and of course we don't reach that.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.605" offset="2714812">We'll only reach that in the event we find that the agency acted pursuant to its statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.310" offset="2741666">Therefore, in a sense, you might very well say Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.444" offset="2754205">That our assertion that the agency is acting beyond its statutory authority is mere placid.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.819" offset="2779700">We would have done it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.139" offset="2784925">The Court would have to decide that anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.919" offset="2792030">It's therefore quite appropriate, indeed you might very well say if you accept the logic, the Government's position of three-judge court is never appropriate because in every case, you will have to -- you can't attack a statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.377" offset="2845947">Once the statute is passed you can't go to court and get it attacked and get it declared constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.059" offset="2868621">You have to wait until it's administered and then it comes up to initial question, did the administration complied with the statutory intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="700.351" offset="2905819">But that you may find it difficult to appreciate why the Government has thought fit to assert that this case is not proper before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.247" offset="2961408">One more point on this and I refer -- if Your Honors please, I got first to go to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.978" offset="2984291">Suppose the Government is correct, suppose the Government is right, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="726.617" offset="3010832">The Court – the case is remanded to whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="728.607" offset="3018773">To Judge Frankel which is the initial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.184" offset="3029117">He decided in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.586" offset="3038730">He held we did have, we did have the standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.193" offset="3049179">We have to therefore go to trial, appeal to the Court of Appeals and then appeal to this Court to which time perhaps this Court would tell us we're wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.209" offset="3081258">Now, we didn't have that which would mean in a trial unnecessary bearing upon the Government in defending this suit in front of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.687" offset="3119188">Now, if there ever was a case which is ripe for decision, this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.616" offset="3150848">It was argued first before Judge Frankel, briefed before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.740" offset="3163387">It was argued before the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.082" offset="3172686">It was argued in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.287" offset="3181568">It was a subject of it as a hearing, extensive hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee in which every recognized the authority on the subject has testified and given the opinion, been subject of innumerable law review articles and textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.253" offset="3253457">What additional with all due respect to the Court of Appeals, what additional light can another argument before the Court of Appeals and the decision before them shed to help this Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="794.236" offset="3281356">Well, that's a practical argument, but not a legal argument on the equation of jurisdiction.</text>

          <turn speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="798.766" stopTime="807.380">
            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="798.766" offset="3299432">Yes, Your Honor, it's a practical argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.970" offset="3312285">Now, returning -- returning to the merits of the issue --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="807.380" offset="3333914">Yes, before you leave that, you do say, do you not in your -- in your brief, you disclaim any attack on the constitutionality of the statute, this statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="817.065" stopTime="1017.316">
            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="817.065" offset="3372680">Only if it is interpreted according to what the Government interprets that authorized the conduct which we declare to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.274" offset="3417506">We believe that the statute can be conserved or preserved by holding that the Court -- that the agency or the Commissioner misinterpreted the statute and the authority, it does not have a statutory authority to use public funds for sectarian schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.021" offset="3496500">Now, returning to Frothingham, we suggest that the examination of the opinion itself and comparison to the opinion with the Massachusetts opinion showed that the Court did not intend there to hold that it lacked constitutional jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.229" offset="3589287">To give you one or two, if you want two examples, the Court asserts that if Frothingham were allowed to sue, there would be the danger of a multitude of these civil suits and this is of course the practical point, you pointed out so strong, it's a practical thing, not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.054" offset="3668595">The Court would not have raised -- asserted that practical consideration if the issue is one of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.055" offset="3696598">It will simply say, under this, does not present a case of controversy under Lee therefore we have to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.421" offset="3726064">But that went into that and it did raise that issue, that practical issue which is an issue relevant to a determination of whether or not to exercise discretionary jurisdiction, but irrelevant where there is no jurisdiction to act at all, no power to act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.443" offset="3794192">Similarly, the Court referred to the distinguished case of Bradfield against Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.637" offset="3818956">Bradfield against Roberts, a taxpayer suit, challenging the constitutionality of the expenditure of federal funds to maintain a sectarian hospital in the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.105" offset="4312775">And that the very last sentence in the opinion which I have before me says that to entertain the suit, would be not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department and authority which plainly we do not possess, which reads to me as the Court is saying two things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.215" offset="5937277">It said that Wilson against Shaw and Bradfield against Roberts, and the other case the question was reserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.292" offset="5969565">Now, our argument that this by the Court in Frothingham saying that no case or the question was reserved is the determination that the issue is not one of jurisdictional power or jurisdictional -- judicial power, but judicial discretion because ever since the earliest time of the Supreme Court, it does not give a advisory opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.799" offset="6351579">It indicates that it did intend to overrule Bradfield against Roberts is the fact that they sought to distinguish it -- Mr. Justice Sutherland so distinguishes it in Frothingham, that doesn't indicate an intent to overrule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.875" offset="6403929">How did they seek to distinguish it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.608" offset="6410825">He said, “that was treated by the lower court as if it were a suit against a municipal corporation, a taxpayer's suit against a municipal corporation and of course said that we consider those somewhat similar to a stockholder's suit and therefore we accept it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.931" offset="6488148">We have argued that if that is so, we're trying to doubt the validity of that distinction because many -- there's a variety of reasons which we have set forth in our brief, but even if that were so, then this case is exactly our old force with Bradfield against Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.500" offset="6566410">Bradfield against Roberts was a suit not against the municipal government of the District of Columbia, Mr. Roberts was the Secretary of Treasury of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.563" offset="7434616">The Solicitor General's suggests a variety of the -- none of which are applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.393" offset="7474009">The Solicitor General suggests for example that the state can conceivably sue to challenge the constitutionality of the application of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.164" offset="7537016">But the stand of New York has taken the position that this is not, it has no jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.544" offset="7586544">New York had -- where this case originated, New York has a constitutional provision specifically forbidding, specifically forbidding this type of expenditure which is being carried on under the Federal Act by the Commissioner of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.359" offset="7649865">And an opinion which was requested of the Attorney General of the State of New York and I have furnished the clerk of this Court the copy of that opinion and the opinion of the counsel for State Department of Education, asking whether -- the question was, could the State of New York cooperate whether the -- from the case of a Federal Act because of its own constitutional prohibitions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.803" offset="7747563">The Attorney General of New York and attorney for Commissioner of Education said, “Yes, because this is not state money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.214" offset="7777238">The State of New York is merely acting as the conduit, merely acting as conduit to transfer the federal money to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.857" offset="7819870">Now, the federal government takes a position that this is state responsibility, the state's exposition is that this is the federal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.651" offset="7854979">The result is, nobody can challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.415" offset="7862084">The State of New York says, “We have no grievance because not a penny of our money is being involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.458" offset="7894267">Now, there is many reasons why the court should take jurisdiction of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.196" offset="7925196">First and foremost, this is -- the issues in this case are just the type of questions which a court should have defied upon on the day this Court was established in 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.213" offset="7981202">This is a forum to determine the constitutional application of federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.789" offset="8003563">There is no other forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.987" offset="8020386">Second, this is a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.937" offset="8040135">The court, the federal courts ever since the Bill of Rights was written, it hasn't been pointed out, they definitely pointed out, the debate on having the Bill of Rights, that the courts are the peculiar guardians of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.121" offset="8108889">It is to the courts which an aggrieved citizen goes to, to determine whether the Bill of Rights is being adhered to or violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.794" offset="8151521">This would be the only case, the only area of the Bill of Rights which would tie for want of practical reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.119" offset="8196869">There is no other part of the the Bill of Rights, from the First through to the Tenth Amendment or the Eight Amendment, which isn't somebody who can go to the courts and get a judicial determination, except if Frothingham is followed except this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.960" offset="8260190">For all practical purposes, this constitutes, you might almost say, a repeal of the Bill of Establishments Clause insofar as it concerns governmental expenditures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.827" offset="8847736">Now, there is one -- another factor which the Government has asserted in its brief which I want to call the Court's attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.530" offset="8918476">The contention that the issues in this case are very complex and therefore it's not in -- the taxpayer's action is not appropriate means of securing the judicial determination of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.950" offset="8972184">I suggest to Your Honors that the issues in this case are relatively simple, child's play, compared to those which were involved in apportionment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.433" offset="9014084">Apportionment cases that involve congressional districts, state upper chamber districts, state lower chamber districts under the committee of municipal districts, municipal apportionment districts, each district, each of these districts is an island to itself must be decided by a Court individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.461" offset="9114290">Yet the Court has taken ever since Baker against Carr, has taken suits which are the equivalent of taxpayers suit, a suit of an individual citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.198" offset="9153160">One individual citizen who has relationship to the whole area of representation is similar to a taxpayer's relationship to the expenditure of federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.377" offset="9213868">He is in the same concept, the same category of de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.778" offset="9231527">There is anything hardly more de minimis than the value of an individual citizen both in respect to, let's say, congressional representation which represents the half the million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.493" offset="9286384">Yet this Court ever since Baker versus Carr and even before Baker against Carr, never had the problems of that, never doubted that the individual citizens whose interest is so minute nevertheless has standing to bring this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.644" offset="9346988">And as I say, the issue there is far more complex than the issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.963" offset="9380216">The point of the matter is that de minimis on which filing was based has no relevancy under the First Amendment and it doesn't have under the citizenship's right to participate in -- select to represent this government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2592.196" offset="10473179">Judge Sutherland might well have stopped in the Frothingham case with his holding that the plaintiff attempted to attack the economic interest and our economic interest was so indeterminate and immeasurable as he could not invoke the preventive powers of Court of Equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.541" offset="10554577">He didn't stop there however and he made other remarks which have been -- which stated in substance that a plaintiff does not have standing to attack an Act of Congress, unless he can establish that he has been injured directly and not merely in some indefinite way uncommon with people generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.175" offset="10637124">Now, as we noted that the Frothingham case does not say that a plaintiff will not be barred from prosecuting his suit merely because his injury is held in common with others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.078" offset="10684667">If the plaintiff injures or if this reasonably direct to defer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.388" offset="10709953">The First Amendment insofar as the statute was concerned was based in the Constitution tot make effective the decoration of the Thomas Jefferson statute for religious freedom in to -- in Virginia that it compelled them make contributions of money for the dissemination of religious opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.073" offset="10796680">He does believe is more simple and ironic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.135" offset="10808905">By adding that into the First Amendment, the Establishment Clause, they all go make [Indiscernible] and simple but also unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.926" offset="10860105">I maintain that a First Amendment case is different from a case generally that an appropriation on expenditure or the violation on the First Amendment of the entire -- on entirely different footing from an appropriation or disbursement authorized by an Act of Congress didn't list, but the case in the Frothingham case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.483" offset="10950280">I respectfully submit that on a fair analysis of the Frothingham case that has nothing whatever to do with the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.028" offset="10988523">The -- under the First Amendment, every American has the constitutional rights not to be taxed or to have his tax money expended for the establishment of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.491" offset="11058322">This is the -- not some remote indefinite right but it is a -- it is the direct interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.119" offset="11088833">It is something in which he has a personal to stake just as a plaintiff in Baker and Carr had a personal state in not having his vote diluted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.466" offset="11134286">So you have in this case, taxpayers, citizens taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.044" offset="11156543">You have them with a specific -- right under the First Amendment not to be taxed or to have that tax money expended in violation of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.604" offset="11202832">In addition to that you have them as -- in the capacity as taxpayers or alleging that federal funds, federal tax moneys to which they have contributed as taxpayers about to be used by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and the Commission of Education to establish religion in violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.768" offset="11307426">Now, it is absolutely essential, unless we're going to amend the – for all intents and practical purposes, if this Court does not have jurisdiction or federal courts does not jurisdiction to pass on this claim, it will for all practical intents and purposes make a dead parchment out of a part of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because effect of the -- or lack of judicial review in claims of this kind would be to say that Congress shall pass no laws respecting an establishment of religion provided that Congress may pass laws appropriating and authorizing the disbursement of tax moneys to establish religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.197" offset="11489134">This is in the -- this First Amendment provision -- of this -- as late Mr. Justice Jackson so well said on one occasion was placed first in the Bill of Rights because it was first in the minds and the hearts of those who drafted and ratified the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.813" offset="11571681">And this Court -- other decisions of this Court, there is a way to obtain judicial review of every denial, of any right created by the Bill of Rights with the exception of these rights under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, if the position of the Government prevails in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.206" offset="11681186">Mr. Pfeffer, pointed them out a moment ago, the great decision in which this Court declared that the right of Americans to enjoy the rights vouchsafed to them by the Democrats does not depend upon any election, does not depend on any vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.161" offset="11757046">But these are rights which are particularly within the guardianship of this Court and certainly, in cases like Baker against Carr where this Court said that a man had a personal stake and he had an concrete adverse position to those on the other side of the case, was the case in which the federal courts had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.232" offset="11861326">That's the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.204" offset="11869163">Here, all these taxpayers, these citizens who have a constitutional right under the First Amendment are to be taxed or to have their taxes extended for the establishment of religion in violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.337" offset="11933738">That's a direct interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.011" offset="11940425">That's a serious personal stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.564" offset="11950665">And every American citizen, who has a personal stake in seeing that the independence of government from religion and the independence of religion from the government observed and when the Congress give -- our executive branch of the government, even in a violation of the Act of Congress on the take -- to take federal tax moneys and they have them expended to establish religion in violation to the First Amendment then a justiciable controversy rises because of the interpretation of the First Amendment is necessary, the decision of the controversy and those who have such a serious -- in such a direct, in such a personal stake in maintaining the separation of church and state as decreed by the First Amendment have standing to sue --</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.332" offset="12765686">The basic charge in this suit is that two high officers of the federal government have acted improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.429" offset="12802152">It's irrelevant, but I think it highlights the abstract nature of the case to point out that the first of the defendants is no longer in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.966" offset="12848232">I don't know what's the name of the case is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.251" offset="12857428">It isn't Flast against Gardner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.527" offset="12878535">The essence of the charge is that these officers have misapplied an Act of Congress or more accurately that they have allowed others, state school officials to make such a misapplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.755" offset="12951468">As indicated in our brief, we raised first the question whether this Court has jurisdiction of this appeal or putting it in another way, whether this was a case which was required by any Act of Congress to be heard by a District Court of three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.893" offset="13039971">In examining this question, I will ask the court to look in three places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.095" offset="13060765">First, the complaint filed in the District Court; second, the text of the statute itself and third, the arguments made here by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.334" offset="13113741">The complaint begins on page 5 of the joint appendix which from the course of habit, I suspect I will call the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.081" offset="13156686">It's carefully drawn by skilled lawyers and I would suppose it could be taken at face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.613" offset="13186884">Incidentally, it makes no allegation whatever that the plaintiffs' tax liabilities have been increased by a reason of anything that has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.317" offset="13233695">Let me call attention first on page 6A of the record to paragraphs 8 and 9 where it is alleged under the heading, factual allegations higher on the page, it was not the intent of Congress in enacting Title I, Section 205 (a) (2) to require local educational agencies in order to qualify for federal funds to violate the prohibitions of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.637" offset="13362949">In other words, they are contending that the statute properly construed, does not provide for any violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.381" offset="13389908">And then in paragraph 9, there is a very interesting allegation, “there are many programs within the meaning of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 which could practicably be instituted by local educational agencies which would qualify them for the receipt of federal funds under the Act, but which would not violate the provisions of the federal constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.692" offset="13487188">In other words, the act, the alleged is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.768" offset="13503488">And then finally on paragraph 11, “on inspiration and belief, it is feasible and practicable for the Board of Education of the City of New York to,” it says expand, I assume it means, expend this -- to -- no, it is expand, “to expand this constitutional programs and institute other constitutional programs and thereby qualify for and receive all the federal funds to which it is entitled under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.228" offset="13621352">Then the complaint goes on to a heading on page 9 under causes of action and there are two causes of action, paragraph 16, first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.768" offset="13675478">“The determination and action of the defendants violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution in that they,” now that's the determination and action of the defendants which is the question of construing the statute, not that the statute is invalid, “constitute a law respecting an establishment of religion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.194" offset="13765130">And summarily in the paragraph 17 of the second count, “the determination and action of the defendants,” again it is the construction made by the defendants which is charged not the statute itself and finally, at the bottom of the page, payers for relief, paragraph 21, the last full line, they referred, they asked the court to declare unconstitutional the determination and action of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.470" offset="13898250">On the page 10, the complaint does move a little further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.372" offset="13921865">It starts out to say that the determination and action of the defendants should be declared unconstitutional and then almost as an afterthought and with no factual allegation to support it, they ask in the alternative if such determination and action are within the authority and in the intent of the Act, the Act is to that extent unconstitutional and void and that phrase is the only thing in the complaint which either asserts or presents any facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.938" offset="14224154">But let me refer next to the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.740" offset="14243380">Much of it though not all of it, is printed in the appendix to the appellants' brief beginning on page 57.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.935" offset="14292177">It's a long statute and obviously very carefully drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.659" offset="14315060">This is the blue covered brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.533" offset="14326554">It's obviously an Educational and Welfare Act by which Congress sought as it stated in the opening declaration of policy to recognize the special educational needs of children of low income families.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.924" offset="14396144">And the fact that special problems are created because such children tend to be concentrated in certain areas and the desire of Congress to assist local educational agencies with concentrations of children from low income families to expand and improve their programs in order to contribute particularly to meeting the specially -- special educational needs of educationally deprived children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.580" offset="14522681">The statute then contains provision for grants to the states either directly or though local education or agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.371" offset="14557895">The applications of the local educational agencies must be approved by the appropriate state, educational agency and this approval requires a determination of several factors, and that I would call the Court's attention to material in Section 205 on page 63 of the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.248" offset="14665415">205 (a) (1) that payments under this Title will be used for programs and projects which are designed to meet the special educational needs of educationally deprived children in school attendance areas having high concentration of children from low income families.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.956" offset="14756216">And then I would call attention to the -- of the Court to the provisions for judicial review which appear on page 69 and then to Title II which relates to library resources where Congress directs the Commissioner to carry out a program for making grants for the acquisition of school library resources, textbooks and other printed and published instructional materials for the use of children and teachers in public and private elementary and secondary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.766" offset="14927475">On page 74 in Section 203 (a) (3) (b), the states are required to provide assurance that to the extent consistent with law such library and textbook facilities will be provided on an equitable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.086" offset="15020784">And there are provisions on page 75 in the same Section which require that the expenditures shall in no case supplant state, local and private school funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.803" offset="15083583">And finally on page 76 in Section 205, it is expressly provided that title to library resources, textbooks and other printed and published instructional materials furnished pursuant to this title and control and administration of their use shall vest only in a public agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.200" offset="15177206">And then finally again on page 77, there is provision for judicial review and there is also provision in Section 206 that the Commissioner shall watch and see that there is no change in the plan which has been provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3995.029" offset="16084490">Now, let us turn to the brief which was filed by the appellees, by the appellants in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.329" offset="16113748">This reinforces the position taken in their pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.165" offset="16129108">It makes it plain that they are talking about administration and not about the basic constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.263" offset="16157424">Indeed, at page 4 of the brief as already been pointed out, the appellant expressly states, first two lines of the last paragraph on that page, “the plaintiffs do not count the constitutionality of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.856" offset="16255854">They then quote paragraph 9 of their complaint to which I've already referred in which they assert that there are many ways in which the statute can be administered constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.873" offset="16307890">Now, let me also point out two other items on page 4 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.477" offset="16334326">One of the contentions that was made in the District Court and which is relevant here is that in this suit as taxpayers they are federal taxpayers and if they have standing to question things in New York, they have as much standing to question was being done in California, Hawaii, and I guess Guam as what happens in New York and they tried to cut that down in the District Court and the statement at the top of page 4 that the plaintiffs through their attorney expressly stated that this case was to be deemed one limited to the practices of the New York City Board of Education not what the federal officer join but the New York City Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.804" offset="16527632">And the last line and a half of the following paragraph, “to defend only the programs and practices engaged within the City of New York.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4152.640" offset="16714982">Just above the middle of the page about 10 lines down on page 17, they say the complaint in the present suit should not have been dismissed for it too should have been deemed a suit against the municipality.</text>

            <text syncTime="5527.525" offset="22214489">The reason that they didn't allege facts it seems to me is what they are seeking here is a broad general declaration of the statutes or about the administration of the statute of theoretical determination divorced from any concrete impact on any party in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.026" offset="22288468">That's why I think it's relevant to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.778" offset="22299544">Some citizens, who happen to be taxpayers too, though I don't think that's important, do not like what the Government is doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5570.614" offset="22386897">For a declaration and injunction that the very general things they assert without ever putting down the single concrete fact are unauthorized or unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.257" offset="22437470">Now, this I submit is essentially a prayer for an advisory opinion, an opinion which is to be rendered in broad, general, and essentially abstract terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="5604.439" offset="22522107">Let me suppose that Secretary Gardner and Commissioner Howe were doubtful and uncertain about their powers and responsibilities under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.940" offset="22564112">Of course they could ask their general counsel or the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare could request the Attorney General to give an opinion, but such opinions would be advisory only.</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.604" offset="22622835">They would not bind anyone outside the Government, but Secretary Gardner and Commissioner Howe wanted a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.000" offset="22656376">So they filed a suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asking for a binding declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.770" offset="22695455">Against whom do they file the suit?</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.114" offset="22708830">Well, that's a nice question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.028" offset="22720533">They've heard that Mr. Pfeffer and know that he has long given thoughtful consideration to these matters so they named him as the defendant and then there’s Mr. Brownell, he knows his way around the Government and they name him as the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.864" offset="22787824">It really doesn't matter who they named since no one has any direct personal interest in the question and it doesn't make any difference since all points of view will be presented as briefs filed by friends of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.190" offset="22849160">In the abstract though, let me observe and in the absence of any concrete facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.479" offset="22874342">I might point out that we have a full court of amicus briefs here and when I counted them last, there were nine and I've lost six to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.752" offset="22919377">Can it be imagined for a moment that the suit by Secretary Gardner and Commissioner Howe would be entertained by any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.064" offset="22956680">I don't think so and why not, because it would be seeking an essentially advisory opinion, a decision in the case which does not really have adverse parties and which did not arise on specific concrete facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="6412.692" offset="25755126">Congress and President are as much want to uphold the Constitution as are the courts or Government lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.764" offset="25791488">The statute involved in this case was long before Congress, thoroughly debated there, carefully drawn with the precise issue here presented well in line and finally resolved by the action of Congress and the approval of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.473" offset="25854286">It should be remembered that the problem before Congress involved not merely the question of church and state, but also another great constitutional principle, the equal protection of the laws provided as to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment and perhaps made applicable to the United States by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.522" offset="25930459">This Court now has before its certain welfare cases where it is contended that if welfare is to be given by a state, it must be made available on a basis of equality to all persons with similar needs without the irrelevant or arbitrary qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.060" offset="25996601">Summarily, Congress could well have concluded that if aid was to be given to needy children, or if books were to be provided for children in school, these things should be available to all children and that anything else would be an inadmissible denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.138" offset="26064938">All that I say now is that these questions are real ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.172" offset="26081134">They are difficult ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="6496.244" offset="26089388">They were wrestled out by Congress in a way that it's entitled to a certain amount of admiration as well as respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6506.963" offset="26132229">In due course, this Court will have to come to its own conclusion and I do not for a moment suggest that the action of Congress or the President though they were aware of their constitutional duties is binding on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6522.127" offset="26192938">But it is entitled to respect and in this situation to weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6527.225" offset="26213313">This is, I submit one of the places where there is some small room for freedom in the joints in our great constitutional structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.059" offset="26248631">This Court will of course not shrink its judicial duty when a truly concrete cases presented by someone who is hurt in one way or another by the application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.001" offset="26296383">Until such a case is presented, proper deference to the coordinate branches of the Government, proper regard to the great principles of separation of powers requires, I submit, that the Court withhold its hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6563.904" offset="26360017">A great predecessor of mine John W. Davis, when president of the American Bar Association referred in his presidential address to this Court's power to pass on the constitutionality of statutes and the criticisms which had been made of the use of that power and the certain proposals to curb it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6586.173" offset="26449042">In discussing this matter, he said, there is a curious misconception underlying much that is said and written on this subject as to the duties that the Court is called upon the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.030" offset="26504526">One might suppose from some of these outgivings that the Court sat at the outer gate of Congress waiting to visit the zealous censorship on the laws that issue from that port and that over then it had a general power of life and death or of approval or of veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="6620.150" offset="26584984">But all thus, as are the functions of the Court, surely they do not go one step beyond the administration of justice to individual litigants.</text>

            <text syncTime="6877.471" offset="27614312">Now we prove our case -- we prove our case especially (a) that that is being done at least in one place and (b) that the Secretary has so approved it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6906.654" offset="27731028">But to get the constitutional issue before the Court, we have to establish at least one place where it's truly, else that it's truly an advisory opinion and no case of controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6917.366" offset="27773868">I want to make one more point about the three-judge court and direct appeal here being a matter of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="6939.424" offset="27862058">Now even if this work, decided by Judge Frankel alone, the issue is of such great significance required an expedition determination that the Court could bypass the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="7057.338" offset="28333725">We certainly would be told you go to the state court and exhaust your state's remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="7078.164" offset="28417003">Baker against Carr, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in a dissenting opinion he stated in Colegrove against Green or you can go to the legislature -- to state legislature, They'll remedy, whatever grievance you have, but of course it didn't because they have the state in the maintenance of the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="7096.979" offset="28492340">Every single state has a spec as the maintenance of the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="7101.415" offset="28510104">It warranted the federal court and the easiest thing in the world is to let it go with the proper court and to find the rationalization for it as New York has done by saying, “Well, we're just a conduit, we don't really exercise determination” and therefore any grievance you have should go to the federal government.</text>
