            <text syncTime="38.742" offset="258382">I am representing the petitioners Jerry Douglas Mempa and William Walkling in both case number 16 and case number 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.128" offset="291924">We filed a joint brief covering both.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.612" offset="301850">These cases present a virtually identical issue to this Court, namely, whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment confers the right to counsel during probation revocation proceedings and at the sentencing which follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.729" offset="346258">The Washington Supreme Court held that these petitioners did not have a right to counsel when they were held into a hearing which was presided over by a superior court judge where they were opposed by a deputy prosecuting attorney and were the basic issue with their continued eligibility for freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.993" offset="411355">We are asking this Court to reverse those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.831" offset="422745">Since they present identical issues with only differences in facts, we ask leave of the Court to consolidate these cases for argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.771" offset="490454">Turning to the facts first in number 16, Mempa versus Rhay, when Jerry Douglas Mempa was 17, he was arrested in charge with the crime of burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.916" offset="527026">An attorney was appointed to represent him and he entered the charge -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.323" offset="544684">This was joyriding.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.120" offset="547819">It was a burglary charge in Walkling.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.718" offset="554193">He was charged with joyriding, which in the State of Washington essentially is stealing a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.491" offset="573315">People in this age bracket frequently are involved in this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.891" offset="586898">An attorney was appointed and the matter came on for trial and he pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.176" offset="604035">Mr. Mempa was sentenced to 30 days in the county jail as a condition for a deferred sentence on the charge of joyriding and such was not entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.538" offset="649488">The order which was entered by the superior court judge is what we call in Washington, an order of deferred sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.573" offset="669654">It's also called probation in State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.157" offset="679999">He was placed under the supervision of the Washington State Board of Prison Terms and Paroles and this is prior to obey their rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.981" offset="707271">Four months later, Jerry Mempa was arrested and brought back before the court on the prosecutor's motion to revoke the probation which had been granted earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.357" offset="736841">He was still 17 years of age and he was accompanied to the hearing only by his stepfather.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.170" offset="756067">He was not asked if he wanted an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.883" offset="762859">He was not asked to have an attorney and nothing was said about the attorney who had represented him four months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.201" offset="784175">The prosecutor read the motion to revoke probation in the matter -- then got underway.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.195" offset="804133">The court asked Jerry Mempa if he had been involved in this alleged new violation of probation which in this case was burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.248" offset="832345">He answered in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.381" offset="836942">At that point, the probation officer took the stand and testified as to the facts concerning this alleged burglary that Jerry Mempa was involved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.643" offset="869961">The judge asked the probation officer if it was not true that Mempa had originally denied this charge when he was arrested but subsequently admitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.666" offset="898069">The probation officer said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.389" offset="908936">At that point, the judge announces that he was revoking probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.877" offset="2370853">In 1962, Mr. Walkling was arrested and charged with the crime of burglary.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.302" offset="2396557">He pleaded guilty and the court placed him on probation for three years, conditioned upon serving 90 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.637" offset="2421948">In 1964, the charges were made that he had been involved in several counts of forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.372" offset="2440861">He was arrested and brought in the court on a motion to revoke probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.420" offset="2457057">On the day he appeared which was in May, he informed the court that he needed continuance to secure an attorney and incorporate the matter over one week.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.809" offset="2486627">A week later, Mr. Walkling was in court at 9 o'clock and said, Your Honor, I think an Olympia lawyer named Smith Troy is supposed to represent me.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.010" offset="2515362">This Court held the matter in advance for 15 minutes when no one had appeared by 9:15, the court proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.066" offset="2539604">Mr. Walkling did not have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.444" offset="2549112">The record is unclear as to precisely whether or not he requested the appointment of counsel or said anything further.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.934" offset="2575130">He alleges in his habeas corpus petition that he repeatedly requested counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.499" offset="2593416">Unfortunately, either reporters' notes were not made of that hearing or if made, the reporter is dead and no one can find the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.785" offset="2618493">So we have no concrete proof that he did or did not request a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.567" offset="2633644">However, in the record is an affidavit from Harold Cook who was then the deputy prosecuting attorney and who appeared against Mr. Walkling.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.943" offset="2675127">In his affidavit, Mr. Cook states that he cannot remember what exactly happened at this precise hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.445" offset="2697174">But he said, Judge Clifford for whom this matter came on for hearing had a practice on all probation revocation hearings of allowing the appearance of retained counsel but he took the position that there was no constitutional right to appointed counsel for indigence.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.550" offset="2749524">He did not have a practice of advising of a right to counsel if a request was made for appointed counsel, his practice was to turn it down but he always accommodated retained counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.360" offset="8528854">In the State of Washington, probation can only be revoked for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.674" offset="8542020">Our statute says that if the man violates the terms of his probation, that means the rules lay down by the probation board having to do with hours he keeps, type of life he lives; Or secondly, if he is abandoned to improper associates, he can have his probation revoked, or if he is engaging in criminal practices, he can end up revoked; Lastly, if he is living a vicious life.</text>

            <text syncTime="2538.334" offset="10256697">American Bar Association committees which have studied this recommend the same thing in ALI Model Penal Code it's recommended to the appointment of counsel in probation revocation hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.235" offset="10292328">In so far as burdens on the system are concerned, I'd like to make -- to give the Court the benefit of some of the information in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.877" offset="10314898">In 1965 in the state system, 144,000 people were placed on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.585" offset="10337677">The average probation case load on 1965, in other words, the total average daily number of people on probation during the year was 230,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.425" offset="10373099">The average number of revocations during that year totaled roughly one third of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.955" offset="10391176">So we're talking similar between 30,000 to 40,000 probation revocations a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.374" offset="10412910">I think this can be handled very easily within our existing system for appointing counsel as result of this Court's Gideon decision, every state now has either a defender system or a system for appointing local members of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.272" offset="10464423">If a man had been appointed to represent this fellow on his original charge, it makes sense to appoint that same lawyer on the probation revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.457" offset="10493158">He argued for probation and now if it's to be revoked, he should come back and represent this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.492" offset="10513324">He has a file on the case, he knows him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.902" offset="10522937">I think these ideas of appointing lawyers for this were just working very easily within our existing system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.858" offset="11346840">As my opposing counsel has stated to you, the issue in these cases concerns the problem of the right to counsel under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in the probation revocation hearings in the State of Washington followed by the imposition of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.955" offset="11447150">Now, I think perhaps for a moment, I like to dwell on how these issues arose and were disposed of in the Supreme Court of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.618" offset="11489886">Mr. Mempa in a pro se petition, contended that in as much as he was not accompanied or did not have counsel at the time of the hearing in the revocation of his probation and the imposition of sentence that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated under the Constitution of United States and under Article 1, Section 10 of our State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.444" offset="11609109">The Supreme Court, as Mr. Schwab has stated, the Supreme Court of Washington held an en banc hearing in the case having first heard the matter by a department of the Court, and then it was ordered, heard en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.591" offset="11681729">The majority opinion decided on the question on due process grounds alone, the dissent touches upon due process, equal protection and the Sixth Amendment considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.942" offset="11747140">In Walkling, Mr. Walkling's attorney contended wholly that his due process rights had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.949" offset="11795205">The counsel in their brief brought up in a five sentence suggestion in the end of their brief that equal protection was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.837" offset="11830732">The matter was decided by order of the Supreme Court finding that the opinions of the Court in Mempa control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.427" offset="11873050">Now, I think it's clear from the historical development of the Due Process Clause in this Court that a number of protections have been accorded to defendants when a question is one of guilt or innocence but the significant difference between these case and the cases that have gone before Gideon, Griffin versus Illinois, Gault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.227" offset="11992273">The issue that was there was one of whether or not the person was guilty of the crime which he's been charged or as in Gault whether or not the person had committed the act of delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.077" offset="12051728">The case here is one in which the defendant has been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.195" offset="12088195">His conviction is having committed the crime, has been constitutionally established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.211" offset="12116198">He had his counsel and presumably upon the advice of counsel, he entered a plea of guilty or he was convicted upon the finding of guilty by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.250" offset="12172413">Now, this is somewhat different from the cases where a defendant must come before a court without a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.606" offset="12221837">Here as Mr. Schwab has indicated, the hearings are relatively informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.835" offset="12246706">There are no pleading problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.114" offset="12255796">There is no complaint information or indictment or the intricacies of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.164" offset="12284008">There, the evidence is sometimes of a hearsay nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.224" offset="12312221">There are affidavits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.408" offset="12364988">In the Mempa case Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.974" offset="12375228">There was attached to the prosecutor's motion an affidavit concerning the facts of the burglary of the used car lot by Mr. Mempa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.310" offset="12424652">The theft to the television sets, some radios and three rifles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.352" offset="12444818">And Mr. Mempa was asked whether the affidavit was read off the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.847" offset="12470732">Mr. Mempa was asked whether or not this -- there are allegations of what he'd been accused were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.859" offset="12498840">The answer in the affirmative, yes they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.879" offset="12514931">That was the nature of the evidence there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.500" offset="12521409">Now Walkling, there is no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.145" offset="12527992">We know not what transpired there but we do know that there were I believe 14 charges of forgery and 14 charges of grand larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.116" offset="12575848">He absconded his parole by going to another jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.932" offset="12591104">He was wanted for a period of almost a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.330" offset="12604688">A bench warrant was outstanding for his production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.744" offset="12622346">And these were the things I'm satisfied, came before the court in his area but as Mr. Schwab have said that there was no record.</text>
