            <text syncTime="29.146" offset="219930">We are here to review by certiorari a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, affirming the dismissal of a complaint of the petitioners who sought review of the dismissal from employment by the Department of Sanitation in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.191" offset="308120">The dismissal predicated exclusively upon Section 1123 of the New York City Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.397" offset="345004">The individual petitioners were garbage collectors, sanitation that as they had called in the brief who were employed at a city dump to which private cartmen brought garbage.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.575" offset="401638">The Commissioner of Investigation with powers independent of the Commissioner of Sanitation under Sections 803 and 805 of the New York City Charter, believing that a crime was being committed namely that these garbage collectors were taking money from the cartmen instead of requiring the cartmen to pay fees to the city.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="117.275" offset="572479">It was a wiretap in this case -- and wiretapped the telephone at the office of the Commission of Sanitation at the dump.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.561" offset="613648">He then subpoenaed or was then directed the individual petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.819" offset="634650">There are 15 in number, to appear before him, the Commissioner of Investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.497" offset="665370">He put them under oath, had stenographic record made, advised them that they were charged with crimes, advised them that he had wiretapped the telephone and their conversations, advised them that they had a privilege against self-incrimination to refuse to answer questions and they also interpolate that he played the recordings of their conversations with other persons what purported to be recordings, but advised them that if they say that they're privileged against self-incrimination as a ground for refusing to answer the questions then in accordance with Section 1123 of the New York City Charter, which he cited to them and cited fairly to them, they would be automatically dismissed from employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.398" offset="872991">Now, the past diverge, 12 of the individual petitioners, these employees asserted their constitutional privilege at a number of cases after getting the advice of various counsels.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.113" offset="931819">As to those 12, they were immediately suspended by the Commissioner of Sanitation, their immediate employer, in a letter which said they were suspended pursuant to Section 1123 of the New York City Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.769" offset="990438">And since that provision which was involved in Gardner against Broderick was never read to this Court and since its language we think in view of our reliance on Slochower is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.102" offset="1047803">Let me just read the critical lines from our point of view of Section 1123 of the New York City Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.211" offset="1080195">It says that if any employee of the city shall refuse to testify or answer any question regarding the property, government or affairs of the city, or official conduct of such an employee, on the ground that, the only ground, on the ground that his answer would tend to incriminate him or shall refuse to waive immunity from prosecution on account of any such matter, his term or tenure of office or employment shall terminate and such office or employment shall be vacant and he shall not be eligible for electoral appointment to any office or employment under the city or any agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.865" offset="1266813">These 12 after getting this notice of their suspension and of charges were told that they could have a hearing, the purposes of which I will question in a few minutes, and they had a pro forma hearing which is the Court of Appeals indicated below was limited to one thing, did they take the Fifth Amendment before the Commissioner of Investigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="312.992" offset="1355316">And they went there upon, dismissed from employment, not on the ground of any substantive proof of any irregularities or violation but on the ground that 1123 of the Charter required their dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.249" offset="1412368">In fact, anticipated their dismissal by making the office forfeit the moment they had asserted their privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.376" offset="1444864">Now, we take the three, the three who did not assert their privilege against self-crimination, but who answered the Commissioner of Investigation denying the existence of any irregularities or misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.750" offset="1502333">Those three were then suspended by the Commissioner of Sanitation for irregularities by which he meant criminal misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.843" offset="1542771">And they were then, through the apparatus of the Commissioner of Investigation who as Your Honors will see serious police functions here, then were called before the grand jury by the district attorney who would receive the information from the Commissioner of Investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.883" offset="1614869">When they appeared before the grand jury, these three were not asked to testify and given immunity under 2447 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which was mentioned to Your Honors yesterday in the Gardner against Broderick case which would have given them immunity with respect to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.931" offset="1695117">Instead, they were asked to waive immunity under Section 2446.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.406" offset="1721031">The provision discussed the Stevens against Marks which would of course have left a viable we think to prosecution for the transaction possibly for more on its face and under the decisions of the Appellate Division in New York would even have permitted their words to be used against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.941" offset="1791143">There are cases of that kind of the Appellate Division which are not cited said in our brief directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.290" offset="1816534">When they, not refusing to answer questions addressing myself to the point made by Justice Fortas and other members of the Court yesterday, when they refused to execute this waiver which was involved in Regan and involved in Stevens, they were then served with new charges by the Commissioner of Sanitation, their employer, charging them with having refused to waive immunity and they were then given a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.461" offset="1929174">And again the hearings with a pro forma were unlimited to the question of whether they had refused to waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.180" offset="1956133">When they insisted at the hearing before a Deputy Commissioner of Sanitation, that the Commissioner should proceed on the charges of irregularities the original charges, the Commissioner refused to do so and limited the issue to the one question, did they assert their constitutional privilege?</text>
            <text syncTime="482.267" offset="2032410">Did they refuse to waive immunity before the grand jury?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="520.753" offset="2186428">Dismissed as the Charter request them to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.383" offset="2200952">We don't question the fact that the Charter was correctly carried out although we think it was a violation of this Court's decision Slochower.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.754" offset="2234389">Now, I come before I come to the details of my argument, let me indicate Your Honors the three basic points of our argument which are -- each of which is an independent ground for the relief which we seek and I emphasized the independence of the points.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.040" offset="2331564">And as Your Honors will see I do not agree in my construction of the statute as I refer to the Charter with either the appellant or the appellee's discussion of it in Gardner against Broderick yesterday with all due deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.661" offset="2394049">Our first point is that a statute which forfeits or declares employment forfeit automatically, unconditionally and irrevocably upon the assertion of the privilege as a ground for refusing to answer questions, denies due process on the Slochower and violates the privilege under Malloy.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.472" offset="2517243">This is the Slochower point, our principal argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.499" offset="2533334">Our second point is the point upon with so much of the discussion yesterday developed and it is that the refusal to answer, we would submit, even an employer's questions based upon the constitutional privilege cannot be used as a basis for dismissing a public employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.469" offset="2637197">This we will call the Spevack extension, the Griffin point, the general question of a penalty or making the assertion of the privilege coarsely.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.219" offset="2684217">And our third point is that in any event, the situation here of refusal to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.877" offset="2718908">This being a refusal to answer in a criminal investigation cannot be used as a basis for dismissing a public employee even if an employer who ask questions of a disciplinary proceeding of a kind referred by Mr. Justice Fortas in his concurring opinion were to have the right to ask the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.593" offset="2821726">And let me proceed, if I may Your Honors, with my first point which is one upon which rely on most because there is less dispute as to that and because this Court has spoken to the point in Slochower.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.592" offset="2877733">This Court held in Slochower that Section 903 of the Charter which is identical in language with the 1123, identical, violated due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.360" offset="2948786">That time we didn't have Malloy against Hogan because it had operated to discharge every city employee automatically who asserted his constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.169" offset="2996015">And this Court relied upon the construction, the construction never changed by the New York Court of Appeals in the Daniman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.424" offset="3033109">Where the Court of Appeals of New York stated, the assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination is equivalent to a resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.809" offset="3078562">And it's said there is nothing noble about such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.158" offset="3092041">Other statutes provide for the -- or interpolate forfeiture of an office or employment upon the happening of an event specified therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.495" offset="3133315">Mr. Justice Clark writing the opinion of the Court regarded the questions asked, I'm quoting, “as being confessed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="764.808" offset="3162572">Mr. Justice Harlan dissenting gave a different view to the statute, a view upon which we rely here for our argument as well as upon Mr. Justice Clark's.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.031" offset="3207502">Cause Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out that even incrimination would not result in a dismissal under 1123 or 903 as it had been was and I would add that even refusal to answer for any ground other than the fifth would not be a basis for dismissal under 1123.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.605" offset="3317844">Mr. Justice Harlan, I think you said correctly that it was the exercise of the privilege which is the basis for the discharge under 903 of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.988" offset="3383359">And Mr. Justice Clark in the Nelson case and Mr. Justice Harlan in Lerner against Casey reiterated the fact that this Charter was directed specifically at the assertion of the privilege not against the general refusal to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.386" offset="3456920">Here we are with exactly the same language of the Charter and that was why I was so surprised to hear some counsel say yesterday that this was not an automatic dismissal from employment under the Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.267" offset="3508433">As a mater of fact, the Court of Appeals in Gardner against Broderick, the latest word on the subject does not suggest any new construction, any change from the construction which then gave to the Charter in Daniman and the Appellate Division for the first department in Koepnick case cited our replied brief on page 3 said, “it will be observed that as the event itself which terminates the employment rather than any adjudication or finding of the same as far as it is possible to do so,” said the Appellate Division Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.459" offset="3673213">The statute provides for a procedure which is self-executing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.627" offset="5921834">It is the question of whether or not when an employer asked questions -- the questions must be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.972" offset="5967287">It raises the question of whether the implications of the majority opinion in Spevack were the implications that encouraged Mr. Justice Fortas on to be adopted by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.630" offset="6253902">If I may turn briefly to the last point of my argument and that relates to the question of why it's happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.084" offset="6291728">The investigation was instituted as a result of a wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.323" offset="6312626">It is our argument there that the investigation, the choice that was given to our clients to assert the privilege or not, to waive immunity or not, was the direct result of the wiretapping that was brought on and that we think it's a violation of the Constitution under both Berger and Katz -- for Berger and Katz jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.956" offset="6403218">The argument is made by the -- by my friends here that the connection between the wiretapping and the hearing, the assertion of the privilege is tenuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.524" offset="6453478">We don't think it's tenuous, we think that so far as this record shows this hearing was instituted by wiretapping these hearings andwouldn't have occurred in the absence of wiretapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.014" offset="6495378">We think the wiretapping is a violation of the Federal Communications Act as well as the Constitution.</text>
