            <label>Mr. Richard B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="195.533" offset="886554">Yes sir, because that is a misdemeanor in Louisiana because there's no provision in the statute for hard labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.299" offset="909542">That is the division and I want to call that point of the Court's attention because there's a good deal of use of the word “misdemeanor” in a federal constitutional sense as if it means something when of course, I think it's clear in light of this record that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.324" offset="965653">That the inquiry of the Court must be to the essential elements of the crime and the potential maximum imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.181" offset="997104">Because of the condition of Louisiana Law, therefore, there was no right to trial by jury under Louisiana Law on the charge against the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.742" offset="1023331">But not withstanding Louisiana Law, he filed a demand for trial by jury before trial basing his contention on the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.576" offset="1062724">This demand was rejected by the trial judge expressly on the ground of state law and the case was tried to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.492" offset="1090414">Witnesses were presented on both sides; four witnesses for the prosecution and three witnesses for the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.279" offset="1117477">There was a factual dispute as to whether a battery had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.834" offset="1131687">The judge resolved the factual dispute in favor of the state and found the appellant guilty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="263.999" offset="1160422">The maximum potential sentence is two years and a $300.00 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.065" offset="1176618">He got two months and a $150.00 fine with a provision that if the fine was not paid, 20 additional days would be added.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.347" offset="1209741">The appellant was released on $1500.00 bond pending appellant procedures in the Supreme Court of Louisiana and in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.806" offset="1235655">An application for a writ of certiorari was made to the Supreme Court of Louisiana which refused to hear the case holding in a memorandum opinion appearing on page 14 of the record, that there was no error of law in the ruling complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.336" offset="1297721">Now it is, of course, the premise of appellant's position in this Court that simple battery as defined under Louisiana Law is a crime and not a petty offense within the meaning of the petty offense exception to the Sixth Amendment jury trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.737" offset="1363341">We think this point is quite clear but appellee takes exception and argues extensively to the contrary, and I would like briefly to deal with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.360" offset="1405868">The court has it seems to me fashioned three independent tests for the determination of whether a charge constitutes a crime or a petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.828" offset="1439723">And there are clear indications in the cases specifically D.C. against Colts, and D.C. against Clawans that anyone of these tests being satisfied would take an offense into the crime rather than the petty offense category.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.001" offset="1492386">The three tests alright, it seems to me the potential maximum sentence and I think Cheff against Schnackenberg, and D.C. against Clawans and Cheff's reliance on 18 U.S.C. 1 makes clear that the Court has at least adapted the six-month rule on that question and has indicated that any offense regardless of other factors where the potential maximum is over six months would be considered a crime for the purpose of interpretation of a Sixth Amendment jury guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.030" offset="1588517">In fact I think the question is left open by D.C. against Clawans as to whether that maximum may not be somewhere beneath that.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.884" offset="1619968">In Clawans, the Court held that three months for an offense that was clearly otherwise a petty offense which was selling unstamped (Inaudible), that they said three months is not free from doubt as to whether three months is too much and reserved the question as to whether any more than that, but I think the very least Cheff makes clear that six months is the upper most maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.872" offset="1695932">Secondly, the Court has referred particularly in D.C. against Colts to the test of whether the crime was in diabolic common law and in our brief, we discussed the common law authorities and our main brief and reply brief which we think clearly indicates that battery was an indictable offensive at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.066" offset="1756641">And the third test is the test of Malum in se interesting for malum prohibitum and I think there can be a little doubt that the charge of intentionally using force and violence upon the person of another is malum is a crime which is malum in se within the meaning of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.159" offset="1817036">Now in order to avoid the logic and I think the inevitable thrust of the Court's decision in this area, the appellee has argued that Cheff against Schnachenberg has abrogated these tests and instead, has created a test which looks to the sentence actually imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.973" offset="1888298">The argument essentially is the appellant's right to a jury trial at the beginning of the trial depends on the sentence imposed by the Court at the end of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.769" offset="1923511">In response to that let me say that Cheff was an expansion of the jury trial right without meaning to get into the controversy of the preceding cases to whether that was a constitutional expansion or a supervisory power expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.825" offset="1971681">It was an expansion and it applied to jury trial right to an area where it had not previously been applied by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.162" offset="1997072">I think in that background, it is hard to interpret Cheff as severely contracting the jury trial right, narrowing the jury trial right in all non-contempt cases which the Court would certainly be doing if it substituted the prior existing test for one that looks to actual sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.551" offset="2066557">But more important than that, I think there was a practical problem in Cheff that induced the Court to look to the --</text>

            <text syncTime="497.671" offset="2095083">I said I think it would be odd to interpret Cheff where the Court went further and applied the jury trial right in an area where it had not been applied before.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.752" offset="2127370">To mean that in the non-contempt area, the right would be radically constricted because a test that looks to actual sentence imposed is one which would provide even if it could be implemented, jury trial in thought fewer cases than a test based on the maximum potential.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.799" offset="2219635">That in fact that argument would mean what you say that in the federal system no matter how much of a sentence that the statute has permitted a maximum, if in fact the sentence imposed was something less than six months and then there was no right to jury trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Sobol</label>
            <text syncTime="549.282" offset="2301555">Secondly, the Court was faced with a practical problem in Cheff and that there is no potential maximum sentence in contempt in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.396" offset="2329976">And that if the rule was based on potential maximum sentence, the Court would be faced with a situation where it would be applying the jury trial the right to every contempt no matter how minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.513" offset="2366443">Now that was the position contended for by some members of the Court, but one could understand why the Court would want to not reach that position in Cheff.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.403" offset="2401970">I think the practical problem is very important there.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.218" offset="2413255">But I think the most important consideration about Cheff is mechanically the rule is workable in the contempt situation, because the trial judge is required to issue the rule to show cause with a citation, before the contempt, the criminal contempt proceeding begins and therefore, has occasion to determine based on his analysis of the facts presented to him whether there is a likelihood of an imposition of sentence in excess of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.621" offset="2502907">Of course in a non-contempt regular criminal trial area, there is no occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.594" offset="2518789">We think the rule in Cheff, if that is a rule that could not possibly work in any other area.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.169" offset="2549091">And we think for those reasons, Cheff is not applicable to the determination of the petty offense crime question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.514" offset="2582424">In sum we think that on the basis for the Court's decision, this case is clearly a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.481" offset="3542371">One is the question as to when there is a case to which the Court holds the Sixth Amendment jury right applies whether it earmarks the jury and I think the Court has so often held that when the Constitution uses the word jury, it means a certain thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.440" offset="3606110">In Patten against the United States, the Court said “An 11-man jury is not a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.468" offset="3726273">I think there is a room based on Gideon and the lower court treatment of Gideon, for the Court to wait until a misdemeanor, by that I mean a federal misdemeanor, less than a year comes before it and perhaps at that time, there will be information before the Court which -- on which it could base a determination as to whether this can be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.856" offset="3823867">I think I was persuaded, for example, by a comment of Judge Jones of the Fifth Circuit in McDonald v. Moore where he held that the right to counsel rule applies to a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.098" offset="3860752">But just in a passing observation, he said frankly he doesn't know how it's going to work because in his hometown of Jacksonville, there are more JP courts than attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.941" offset="3892203">And they all sit on Monday morning, but he said that because of the earmarks of that particular offense, the right was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.486" offset="3918326">I think those are problems the Court obviously has to think about.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.567" offset="3930655">If in New York City for example has an amicus brief before the Court in this case on this point, if in some sense mathematically, a jury could not be made available for the 12,000 cases that were tried that Mr. Leftwood refers to, I would think the Court would want to consider that in reaching a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.072" offset="4016650">In sum, I'm saying that I think to the extent there is room to -- for caution and to wait, I think the room has to be on the depths or how farther right goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.382" offset="4065970">I don't think based on the history of the interpretation of the jury trial right in this case and the court's history whenever a right isn't going to be applied to the state that it's not the water down right but it is a full right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.801" offset="8543566">It would have to be a serious, I mean, it would have to be a petty -- the nature of the offense would have to be petty.</text>
