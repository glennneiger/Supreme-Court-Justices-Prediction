            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="4987.687" offset="20054079">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.215" offset="20076231">The standards which this ordinance sets forth have in many areas already been rejected by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.119" offset="20111862">It might be worth the moment to look at the standards themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.984" offset="20127326">In determining that a picture is not suitable for children, the Board must first determine whether the picture describes or portrays brutality, criminal violence or depravity or nudity or sexual promiscuity or extramarital or abnormal sex relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.364" offset="20204857">Second, if the picture describes any of these phenomena, the Board must determine whether the portrayal is such that it is likely “to insight or encourage” crime or delinquency or actual promiscuity in the part of the young persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.038" offset="20275493">Third, in determining whether it is likely to insight or encourage crime, delinquency and so on, the Board must determine whether there is in its judgment “a substantial probability that it will create an impression on young persons that such conduct is profitable, desirable, acceptable, respectable, trustworthy and commonly accepted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.429" offset="20373086">Now, identical of similar standards have been condemned by this Court and other courts as too vague to satisfy constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.429" offset="20401089">For example, “sexual immorality” People against Bookcase; “prejudicial to the best interest of the people”, the Gelling case; “Creating a harmful impression on the minds of children”, Paramount against Chicago stricken out; “Sexual immorality is desirable, acceptable, or improper patterns of behavior”, Kingsley stricken out, and some of these cases of course have dealt with the protection of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.535" offset="20513520">That doctrine that there may be variable obscenity has never been extended to mean that there can be variable vagueness and this statute is void and defective completely because of vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.785" offset="20570467">Just two or three other brief points, it has been suggested here for the first time that my client United Artist may protest and has standing before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.555" offset="20609546">That is not so at page 128 of the record without reading it subdivision 7, only in exhibitor may file a notice of nonacceptance, not a distributor and indeed the exhibitors as this Court has observed takes little to deter the exhibitor from going to this kind of a contest and that one occasion we've even had to threaten to sue the exhibitors so we've filed as nonacceptance so we could get an intervening application.</text>

            <text syncTime="5157.527" offset="20733471">Mr. Nizer, to what extent had distributors participated and submit in these voluntary submissions?</text>

            <text syncTime="5186.322" offset="20848619">In very few, if any though I have not the statistics before me but I will go further Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.229" offset="20872338">The exhibitor has yielded against his will in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.363" offset="20884773">There is this matter of fighting the authorities of a community in which you live and depend upon the good will of it and this very existence of this ordinance is itself a suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.965" offset="20927195">There would not have been 39 overrulings in the exhibitors who's finally saying this is alright with me when he submits a specific request for a suitable classification and it's overruled, and he says let's go along because he doesn't want to spend the money for counsel to come up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.261" offset="20996368">One other observation about the Freedman case which I think we owe to Your Honor, a candid statement about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.111" offset="21019773">We don't think that the Freedman case has been complied within consequently, this statute is void in any event in this application to the reasons I have given that you can have a complete final determination without any judicial participation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.879" offset="21098872">But I would -- I think we owe to this Court to be candid to say that the motion picture industry has never been able to adjust itself to the proposition that while other medias such as magazines, newspapers, television even comic books may not be restrained by prior consideration, prior submission that we cannot share that sunshine and that we stand in the shadow of a five to four decision which says that we alone, the motion picture industry comes into a special category.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.391" offset="21240978">We would therefore respectfully suggest now that this has demonstrated the ineffectualness of the Freedman case in attempting to modify the effects of the Times case that if we went on the cause --</text>

            <text syncTime="5316.906" offset="21370964">The Times case which puts the motion picture industry in the special category was and I merely observed that I think while the Freedman case was an admirable effort to avoid the abuse by these judicial requirements that nevertheless it hasn't worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.052" offset="21443584">Well, here we are on Viva Maria, if Your Honor if you see that picture you'll be shock that this picture could be caught in that kind of a net when it was intended for something else and next day it will be something else and then it will be as I've indicated a proliferation of these ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.229" offset="21500322">I wish to observe that while it is true that in this case there's no salary to these people, that in most of these proposals, they not only receives salaries but there is a fee for submitting the picture for their examination and you get the entire bureaucracy imposed upon this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.087" offset="21571688">And I think that this will cause a great flood of this kind of case whereas if we -- if in dealing with this difficult question, if we subjected the restraint to at least to penal provisions or at most injunction and declaratory judgment with all the safeguards for a defendant with the presumption of innocence and beyond the reasonable doubt, then I think this perhaps might be held in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.858" offset="21682761">And the penal statute would get after the man that should get after some case where somebody is really trying to overstep the bounds of sensibilities of the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.335" offset="21720691">This is not this case at all.</text>
