            <text syncTime="7.861" offset="134771">It's George Campbell Painting Corporation, appellant versus William Reid et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.023" offset="151489">Mr. Blinder, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_a_blinder" startTime="27.767" stopTime="521.794">
            <label>Mr. Albert A. Blinder</label>
            <text syncTime="27.767" offset="214392">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.720" offset="246262">This case like the one just argued before it is on appeal from the New York State Court of Appeals from a decision rendered the very same day as Gardner against Broderick.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.926" offset="315120">In its opinion, the New York State Court of Appeals declined that the statute in this case which is Section 2701 of the New York Public Authorities law was constitutional and based its finding upon the decision in Gardner against Broderick.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.902" offset="418983">Now, the statute in question which is also identical with several other statutes in New York such 103 of the municipal law and a section of the finance law, provides similarly that if a person is called before a grand jury concerning a transaction or contracts with -- that states any political subdivision thereof, a public authority or with any public department, agency or official of the state or if any political subdivision thereof or of a public authority and refuses to sign a waiver of immunity or refuses to answer any relevant question then such person or any firm, partnership or corporation of which he is a member, partner, director or officer shall be disqualified for a period of five years from biding on contract or from doing business with the state and also any existing contracts at the time may be cancelled or terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.783" offset="754500">In this situation, we are presented with the question as to whether the Fourteenth Amendment is offended by the public authority's law because of the requirement that a corporation be disqualified when one of its officers or directors asserts or refuses the way the privilege against self-incrimination and as a corollary of that, whether the resignation and surrender of control by such an officer or a director prior to being called before a grand jury, makes automatic application of the statute repugnant to the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.418" offset="941014">We also have the question as to whether a direction by statute that all public contracts contain an agreement to waive the privilege against self-incrimination is an unconstitutional condition of doing business with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.110" offset="1023770">Now, the facts in this situation are somewhat different than the Gardner against Broderick case previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.786" offset="1066506">In fact, the appellants which is a corporation was disqualified from doing business with the state for a five year period and its contracts were terminated because one of its former officers have refused to sign a waiver of immunity when subpoenaed before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.718" offset="1166294">In fact, the individual in question was the president and a director of the corporation until about three weeks before he was subpoenaed before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.733" offset="1234317">While the corporation bears the same name as the individual in question, he is the son of the founder, he was 24 years of age at the time that he was subpoenaed and was not in actual control of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.307" offset="1292622">He was the (Inaudible) I had because he was the heir of power to his deceased father.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.964" offset="1327208">About three weeks after resigning his officers and giving up his stock which was 10% of the outstanding stock of the corporation, he was subpoenaed before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.192" offset="1384155">The following day, he appeared, refused to sign a waiver of immunity and the corporation a week later was notified by the New York City housing authority that its contracts were terminated and that the appellants was disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.674" offset="1482062">I might add that before the subpoena was served upon him, the corporation notified the appellees that in fact he had relinquished his officers and was no longer the president and director of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.577" offset="1557713">When he appeared before this grand jury pursuant to subpoena, he was never asked the question and never refused to make any answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.498" offset="1613406">In fact, all of the other officers and directors who were subpoenaed before this grand jury, signed waivers of immunity, some were called in to testify and did testify, some were not called in to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.220" offset="1676204">Two days after the letter of disqualification was sent out by the City Housing Authority, the appellant corporation requested a hearing as to its disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.470" offset="1741302">That letter was ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.841" offset="1750706">Four days later, a telegram was sent by the appellant's corporation also to the City Housing Authority, requesting a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.817" offset="1790621">Two weeks thereafter, a letter was sent by the City Housing Authority to the appellant corporation, advising the corporation that it could not have a hearing and that it need not bother communicating with the housing authority again about this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.413" offset="1873063">I'm unable to advice the Court as to the content of the waiver of immunity which was offered to the individual in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.905" offset="1919039">The grand jury being a secret proceeding, we were not acquainted with its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.996" offset="1939310">We assume it was a general waiver of immunity and we have not seen any transcript of testimony concerning the questioning by the assistant district attorney of the individual, asking him to sign the waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.573" offset="2025618">The letter which advised the appellant corporation that it was disqualified said and this is the only way we know it that the grand jury in addition to investigating alleged bid rigging was only investigating bribery of the labor official, extortion, coercion, assault and conspiracy of each of these other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.258" offset="2140453">Now, our argument of course is based on much of what was discussed in the Gardner argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.630" offset="2385899">There was no administrative hearing despite the fact that one was requested and there were no questions put to the former president when he appeared at the grand jury room.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.485" offset="2881285">We don't even know that so that under the circumstances, we not only state that the statute is unconstitutional but certainly its application as the New York Court of Appeals said it was valid.It's repugnant to due process and the Slochower.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.106" offset="3207816">I believe that that is an opening question in Spevack.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.035" offset="3223489">And under the circumstances, this Court might very well find that our people before our proper administrative tribunal have to demonstrate their fitness and qualification but we say that the grand jury was absolutely the wrong tribunal that it never had the functions of determining fitness and qualifications of a public contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.658" offset="3310007">In fact and I believe this is set forth by our brief with -- in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.775" offset="3330487">The grand jury by statute may only look into criminal misconduct of public officials and when the counsel for the appellee in the proceeding argument said that the grand jury may present on other than criminal matters, he was not quite stating accurately the Law of New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.779" offset="3426513">The lore of New York State as it is clearly set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.098" offset="3451800">It says that in the cause of examining into whether there was criminal misconduct, if it finds that there was non-criminal misconduct of public officials that at the discretion of the Court, it may make a recommendation concerning this non-criminal misconduct of public officials but there again, if it does make such a recommendation, the public official who was so charged has the right within 31 days to file an asset to the presentment of the grand jury before that presentment can be made public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.444" offset="6253171">And I must argue to the Court that certainly, within the realm of a transaction and a contract with the state, I can imagine how a grand jury can determine the issue as to whether an assault bears upon the contractual obligation of the contractor or upon his fitness or qualification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1583.109" offset="6435819">In fact, under the statute, they do not have to confine the grand jury investigation to only the contracts in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.365" offset="6472808">Under the statute, they can look into any transaction with any political subdivision or any public official and I assume in this case they could even ask questions concerning whether his taxes were paid, whether the streets were properly paid outside of his house assuming he had an obligation to do so and they could probably ask questions which not in the least could affect his fitness and qualification as a public contractor with the New York City Housing Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.716" offset="6598196">So all I can say on this is that without specifically being advised of the nature of the inquiry and that they were looking into the contracts which were allegedly the ones in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.334" offset="6660681">The individual would be waiving immunity as to all kinds of remote things which couldn't possibly bear upon fitness and qualification and therefore, carrying at once that further, the corporation could in turn be penalized by an inquiry that would have nothing to do with its function as a public contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.471" offset="8693217">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.287" offset="8720488">At the outset, I should like to make the position of these appellees quite clear that whereas in view of the fact that we're here arguing this case along with the case that's relating to public employees, in view of the fact that Court of Appeals has sight of the Gardner case as a authority that have decided the same day as our case, as authority for upholding the constitutionality of Section 2601.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.777" offset="8846503">In view of those facts, we take it that the decision of this Court on the public employees' case, will have an impact in my opinion, a major impact upon the equation of the constitutionality of Section 2601 of the Public Authorities Law which is an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.130" offset="8919855">It is our position however that if Section 1123 and Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution are held to be constitutional with respect to the public employees and certainly in our opinion a fortiori, this Section of the Public Authorities Law which imposes as somewhat similar duty upon public contractors rather than public employees should likewise be held unconstitutional and that in my opinion then should be the end of the case at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.080" offset="9063737">However, by no means that we concede that the commerce is true because there are so many points of distinction between this case and the cases of the -- the public employees' cases that under any circumstances, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.719" offset="9142209">And those points of distinction relate -- are based upon two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.206" offset="9160182">One on the general proposition as Section 2601 applies to public contractors all over the state generally and certainly upon the peculiar circumstances of this particular case, some of which had been brought out by questioning of various of the justice of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.934" offset="9247117">Now, with that purpose, I should like to fill in somewhat more of the facts in this case that have been thus far brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.558" offset="9293615">The authority which is the appellee here is a state created agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.885" offset="9314931">And in fact, it is so designated as a state agency under the Public Housing Law, designed to carry out the functions of the State Constitution of some slum clearance and the creation and construction of public housing for low income families and as such, all of the statutes of the state according to public corporations or public divisions applied to the New York Housing Authority, the appellee here, the authorities given authorization by the public housing law, Section 151 to bid its public contracts for maintenance of its projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.852" offset="9482742">There are about 150 of these projects, housing equals to 600,000 low income tenants or person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.145" offset="9515969">In the bidding of its periodic painting contracts, three of these contracts were bid upon by this upheld and cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.697" offset="9562154">And it has been brought out those three contracts which are in issue here was signed on behalf of the appellant corporation by George Campbell, Jr. its president.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.175" offset="9620041">In addition to the fact that these contracts contained the mandatory provision of Section 2601 of the Public Authorities Law that the corporation or its officers -- corporation of that contract of an individual or if a corporation and its officers must waive immunity and answer question in a narrowly related field and I'm referring now, particularly calling to mind Mr. Justice Fortas' statement as Spevack, that the corporation must as Section 2601 provides by its officers answer questions were then called before the grand jury concerning any transaction or contract have with the state, any political subdivision thereof a public authority or any public department or subdivision of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.558" offset="11757589">It does not appear on the face of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.474" offset="11769292">The Public Authorities Law on the other hand, expressly provides for a judicial hearing on the very issue that has been raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.515" offset="11813386">Now the issue that has been raised -- that was raised throughout the record in the courts below was not a constitutional issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.878" offset="11834911">You won't find any constitutional issue in the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.007" offset="11851421">It was only raised on appeal in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.483" offset="11869288">The issue that was raised was solely a question of interpretation of the statute of Section 2601 and that is as to whether an officer who have resigned just before being called before the grand jury was still to be considered or deemed to be an officer for the purpose of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.762" offset="11946402">Now, the Court of Appeals so decided and I respectfully submit that decision is binding upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.074" offset="11979630">The Court of Appeals did not negate the fact that this young man had resigned just before he was called before the grand jury but the Court of Appeals did say that in view of these particular circumstances and in view of the nature of this statute, in view of the nature of the requirement that he shall be deemed to be an officer enacting in his capacity at that time he was subpoenaed before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.619" offset="12081821">Moreover, the Court of Appeals further said that there may be times when the statute will operate to penalize a corporation which have actually served at its connection with the recalcitrant officers and which has otherwise been cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.542" offset="12137514">This is precisely the circumstances my opponent was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.822" offset="12154650">The Court of Appeals went on to say the legislature has, however, recognize this problem and has specified a procedure by which the disqualification can be removed under such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.765" offset="12202402">Now, here is not only an administrative hearing, it's a plenary judicial hearing which this corporation had available to him in addition to which this Section 2603 which I have just read from, provides that such in cooperation can go into the Court, the Supreme Court and get a stay against any harm to it whatsoever including a stay against cancellation of this very contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.854" offset="12302817">Now, that in my opinion is full judicial due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and it has been so held by this Court in a number of cases which we cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.101" offset="12351822">Now, some more of the distinctive provisions between -- the distinctions between this and the public employee cases are as follows and I think this is to touch upon some of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.362" offset="12404799">Here, we have a claim of violation of Fifth Amendment rights of somebody who is not even here in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.970" offset="12447222">George Campbell, Jr. is not a party to this preceding only the corporation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.461" offset="12469164">If George Campbell, Jr. had been a party to this proceeding and he had come in and claimed this compulsive waiver was costly to me because, one, I myself was the contractor who is disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.153" offset="12540008">That is an issue that might have to be decided in line with the public employees' cases.Or even if he had said, I am the principal officer stockholder of this corporation and while not directly, indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.744" offset="12594343">You are making it costly to me to exercise my Fifth Amendment right and therefore it's unconstitutional for you to do so, that's another situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.585" offset="12633736">But that is not the situation before this Court and I respectfully point out to this Court that I think you will shortly have that situation before you in a case that is now pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.473" offset="12677308">And that's the case of Holland against Hogan which I sat and listened to in the three-judge court down in New York and which I believe is now before this Court the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.315" offset="12712626">And there, I believe there is a situation of an officer and a stockholder of milk companies as I believe it is Mr. Hirshowitz, would you going to be in that case, who are claiming that very violation I am talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.195" offset="12768110">Here, we have no such situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.360" offset="12796844">Now, it's a peculiar circumstance in this case that this contract to which they subscribe, not only contain the one condition that its officers must waive immunity and find the information as to other contracts had with state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.545" offset="12873540">It contained another condition that in my opinion was even more open to complaint that they complain about it but it was nevertheless valid and that is that at the time the contract was signed, the corporation by its principal officers must sign a non-collusive affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.638" offset="12937906">I believe that type of affidavit is required in federal contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.830" offset="12954728">There, they must swear that they have not been entering into this contract colluded with any other person, firm or corporation to rig the bid and so on and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.055" offset="13003630">Now, there is a condition which requires a statement of something that might have been a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.101" offset="13051800">In fact, that statement turn out to be a crime because as the record here shows, Mr. George Campbell, Jr. and the corporation were both indicted for perjury for falsifying that non-collusive affidavit and while this case was pending and coming to the course to this Court, both the corporation and Mr. George Campbell, Jr. pleaded guilty to an indictment of bid rigging which was a separate indictment which included this perjury count in a non-collusive affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.928" offset="14091055">It's up to the District Attorney or the grand jury to decide whether their criminal prosecution in the public interest is more -- they are more concerned with that than they are concerned with getting administrative information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.085" offset="14151764">It's up to the administrative agency which has to spend the state's funds to be concerned with the question of getting answers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.056" offset="14203591">They will not permit any person under investigation to testify without a waiver then the administrative agency is in the position where it cannot get the answers to the question that it should have.</text>

            <text syncTime="3718.711" offset="14978173">You began in this case by saying that if the previous case were decided in favor of the respondent a fortiori would control your case but not conversely and that it occurred to me at the time that in so far as your case does not involve a public employee, your adversary might have more rights and I'm thinking of the language in Spevack against Klein.</text>

            <text syncTime="3755.625" offset="15125922">Well, Your Honor, with respect to that, I should respectfully like to refer you to the opinion of Judge Kennedy which was confirmed -- affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which I think was eloquent and quite exhausting and pointed out that a public contractor should by far more firmly be in a position to be subjected to the requirement of candor and practice even then a public employee because a public employee can be selected by the state on the basis of qualifications which were examined long beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.792" offset="15314526">They can be rejected by the state for lack of qualifications of various kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.972" offset="15331244">A public contractor on the other hand aptly is forced upon a public agency simply through the bidding process and therefore, as the public contractor bidding for a lucrative contract in competition with others in his position who are willing to subscribe to these provisions, he certainly should have no less than obligation than a public employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.687" offset="15446079">In fact, the very words of these sections of the Public Authorities Law arose from the very type of grand jury investigations that were involved here and you'll find in my brief a reference to the birth of the statute through the governor's message who approved it and signed it and I think the Attorney General has a reference to the Attorney General's recommendation that the statute be adopted because a grand jury was frustrated in its investigation of public contracts because they were blocked by the refusal of public contractors to testify before a grand jury either to waive immunity or to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.079" offset="15615666">And I say because this is a public purpose, a vital public purpose, important public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.731" offset="15646281">The condition that was created here is one that is in all respect, it should be held valid by this Court to whether or not the public employee situation is decided by this Court in accordance with the question that was left open to Spevack against Klein.</text>

            <text syncTime="3949.408" offset="15901027">He has cited in his brief a case of Wood against Hughes I think as the Court of Appeals decided in 1961 which upset to the dismay of the Attorney General and in fact, every law enforcement agency in the state, upset the century and a half old practice of grand jury presentments on the ground that there was no statutory authority for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.023" offset="15999457">That is the Court of Appeals held that because the statute that authorized the grand jury to make investigations only authorized criminal investigations and therefore, they could not make presentments as to civil or fraud or corruption or anything else as to which no indictments resulted.That was in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.111" offset="16083780">In 1960, just about three or four years thereafter, that case was overruled by a specific act of the legislature and you will find in my brief the government's message on that Act which refer to that case and said that it was unfortunate the Court of Appeals so held but we are now presenting a statute and adopting a statute which expressly authorized the very type of presentment they had theretofore without statutory authorization or something and that is the present situation today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.127" offset="16223901">In fact, the Court of Appeals decision here, now here before you in the Gardner case points out that it was before the grand jury that the information that the public had a right to know and it was not given by Gardner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.417" offset="16277086">Now the Court of Appeals said that obviously must mean that the public would have a right to know whatever information Gardner would have given.</text>

            <text syncTime="4133.585" offset="16637680">The points that I intend to make the duty of the public contractor to furnish information as to the securing and the execution of public contracts which is even more than but at least equal to to that of a public employee discussed in the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.322" offset="16748648">Secondly, the expressed waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege and the contract executed pursuant to the statute and the lack of ability of the appellant corporation to challenge the requirement for a limited waiver of immunity of its officers which it undertook in the contract to deliver to the state before Spevack and Garrity this Court and the cases mentioned (Inaudible) and Nelson in various areas upheld the duty of candor, the obligation of public employees to respond to calls for information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.750" offset="16950418">These cases followed chronologically Slochower case where the Court appears to have made the type of inquiry and important factor and applied that if the petitioner there had invoked the privilege at an inquiry relevant to the performance of his duties, the outcome would have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.999" offset="17047385">Somebody expressions in the dissenting opinion by various justices of this Court in Lenoir and Nelson indicated to emphasis upon the type of inquiry involved in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.210" offset="17108198">The Attorney General upon the phases of a study of the cases that I've referred to, recommended the legislation that is under consideration by this Court and then the governor and the memorandum, speaking of the urgent need for the legislation approved it and the governor's memorandum is quoted in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.996" offset="17207359">It cannot be plausibly disputed that the inquiry whose subject is collusion of public contractors and bidding practice involved in the present case just as is the inquiry as to the police officers' performance of his duties involved in the Gardner case is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.798" offset="17302549">The claim of privilege of the police officers in the previous case and an investigation of the official duties of such officer is incompatible with the duties and responsibilities of such officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.039" offset="17363571">Such incompatibility is antagonistic to a rational system of law enforcement and dismissal for lack of candor in such circumstances is a proper exercise that I submit of the state's police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.678" offset="17438072">As a consequence, every state case to which we have been referred has upheld a dismissal of such public officers before and after the Malloy case and the Griffin case predicated upon the paramount right of the people to protection against law violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.294" offset="17536502">As a matter of fact, the District of Columbia Court contains a provision which is similar to the statute under consideration here and has an additional paragraph which refers to former officers and says if they refuse to testify then that action rights can be abrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.306" offset="17632632">And the uniform rules of evidence Rule 25, prepared by the uniform commissioners, is in line with this expression as to both public employees and public contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.382" offset="17696893">The appellant in its briefs has not disputed the importance of the objectives sought to be achieved by the state's disclosure requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.488" offset="17745272">The need for self-disclosure as a means of achieving the objective since proof of collusive bidding is normally solely within the knowledge of the participants or the responsibility of the public contractor to account to the state for his actions in obtaining and performing state contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4651.634" offset="18709922">They testify that as I understand that in the bidding practices, bids were selected by roads and it was agreed that advances though would be the low bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.046" offset="18787558">As my associate here pointed out to the Court, every such public contractor as the appellant executes an affidavit of non-collusive practices before obtaining the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.623" offset="18853909">Thus, apart from the statute of being -- apart from the statute that's under consideration by this Court, we maintain that its officers were under a duty to furnish the appropriate information to the state or its investigating agencies when called upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.019" offset="18927470">The statute did not create such a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.452" offset="18941158">It provided that when the refusal to furnish the information as to the securing and performance of contracts -- public contracts as before a grand jury, the contractor would be disqualified for five years and it is this disqualification not the cancellation Justice Marshall, it's the disqualification that's under consideration in this case and not the cancellation as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.977" offset="19063306">The five years is the same period of disqualification which was involved in the case of a public officer under Article I Section 6 of the State Constitution, and in drafting the statute, we and the Attorney General's office used the Article I Section 6 as a prototype on what to put in to the proposed legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.793" offset="19170513">The conference of the legislature that the grand jury would not act capriciously in calling upon public contractors or their officers to furnish such relevant information is the reason why the particular section provides for waiver of immunity before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.364" offset="19268838">The grand jury is the young, the people of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.875" offset="19286915">It has fads or fantasies and it has no leanings in any direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.395" offset="19312933">And as a protection to the public contractor, the statute provides that only in the case of refusal to waive immunity before the grand jury, may the contractor be disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.041" offset="19379493">Appellants rely upon Garrity and Spevack.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.017" offset="19403421">And they maintain that regardless of the above considerations, this Court has already determined that the objective cannot be constitutionally achieved and that state and its subdivisions must by force or continue to pay from the public treasury corporate contractors whose officers refuse to disclose facts relating to the securing and execution of the public contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.426" offset="19513031">The New York Court of Appeals in Gardner and in the present case and the three-judge court in a case that has to follow here, the Sanitation Employees case has read Garrity and Spevack as not affecting the state's responsibilities to secure necessary and relevant information from public employees and public contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.604" offset="19621804">Even before Spevack, some state courts Justice Fortas in Florida and Illinois simply differentiated the attorney from the public employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.837" offset="19678751">I'm referring to two cases Shiner against the State in Florida 82 Southern Second 57 and In re Harlan in Illinois, 36 Northeast and Second 545, they contrasted the general duty of an attorney to aid in investigating with the specific duty of public employees in that case such as police officers to furnish information and in the Spevack case, the disbarment of the attorney of course puts him out of business besides the reputation -- detriment to his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.770" offset="19850428">The public contractors involved here simply lose its part of his public business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.038" offset="19875506">Here, the appellant said in its petition and repeated on in his argument that he lost 15% of his business by a reason of the disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.496" offset="19937364">The Garrity case too does not appear to be helpful to the appellant as the New York Court of Appeals pointed out the person executing to limited labor immunity nevertheless obtains constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.353" offset="19996818">Thus, if the officer here had executed to waiver as I said before, he could not be prosecuted upon the evidence secured by his testimony or by any fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.061" offset="20047600">Such immunity is coextensive with the waiver of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.522" offset="20069439">Appellant recognizing in its reply brief and then an exchange for immunity for such prosecution, the witness would be under the duty to testify, contends that the state was required to offer the witness more complete the immunity for many criminal prosecution even derive from testimony unrelated to any evidence given by the witness or leads obtained thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.747" offset="20186363">Thus, the issue oppose by the appellant is a very narrow one as opposed the witness would be required to testify despite disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.829" offset="20242683">The only dispute presented by the reply brief is whether Garrity means that the witness thereby obtains complete immunity under the Counselman case or the limited immunity exemplified by the Murphy case and held by the New York Court of Appeals in (Inaudible) and in Leno.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.127" offset="20355845">I see nothing in the reply brief which contends that in addition to this promise of immunity of one category or another, immunity must also be given from other sanctions such as the disqualification from a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.373" offset="20428884">The disqualification imposed here is imposed in a manner consistent with the requirements of due process, the contract and those by statute and by contract that testimony of officers maybe required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.036" offset="20491473">The question of whether or not disqualification is or would be justified may be raised by the contractor as the New York Court of Appeals pointed out in the specific statutory provisions which are adversary read.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.974" offset="20551241">Appellant in his reply brief acknowledges this and states that it has deliberately refused to avail itself of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.256" offset="20608397">Thus, this case is distinguishable also from Spevack because the contractor here has an opportunity to be heard on the reasons for the refusal to testify and in this very case had the corporation presented to the Court in a proceeding under the Section to which I have referred the fact that this was a former officer and that he had resigned in good faith if these were the case that he had no longer had any interest in the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.909" offset="20730964">If this were the case that he was not in league with the other officers of the corporation of this very case, I'm sure that the court acting under that section would have eliminated the disqualification but the appellant was in no position to do that because the only office who refuse to waive immunity, signed a limited waiver of immunity was George Campbell, the president and as you heard, he was the one who's subsequently was convicted of pleaded guilty to a conspiracy for bid rigging so he knew in advance and I'm sure the corporation knew because it also pleaded guilty that this was one officer who could not testify because he had information in his possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="5218.948" offset="20979127">I just have one or two rebuttal arguments which I will try to confine in just a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.736" offset="21018311">Number one, with respect to the irrelevancy of the corporation having pleaded guilty to one count of a misdemeanor, may I just say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.601" offset="21081736">The plea of guilty that was offered by the corporation appellant here was to one count in a multi-count indictment that was offered prior to the commencement of a mass conspiracy trial that lasted over three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.692" offset="21150177">The District Attorney recommended the acceptance of the one misdemeanor count.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.764" offset="21170448">In fact, this was a business decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.946" offset="21183195">It would have cost the corporation far more money to a defendant on this situation and then there's the maximum penalty on the misdemeanor that it pleaded guilty to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.369" offset="21228857">It did not plead guilty to all of the other things which my learned friends over here mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.640" offset="21261981">I say this is an irrelevancy because under the New York State Law the fact that a corporation may have pleaded guilty does not result in automatic disqualification and certainly not for a five year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.013" offset="21307434">The only way this occurs is if someone refuses to waive immunity or refuses to -- or asserts his privilege against self incrimination and I believe that that's the very crux of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.355" offset="21360828">Now, as Mr. Justice Fortas inquired before, may I just refer to the learned Court to pages 25 and 26 of our appellant's brief which contains the New York State statutes and from Section 2(a) of Section 253(a), it is obvious that the grand jury's power derives only from the right to investigate criminal conduct and then if in addition to its investigation of criminal conduct, it finds non-criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.950" offset="21523205">It may make a report which is still subject to certain other conditions and the other conditions involve the preponderance of credible and legally admissible evidence and also, it gives the officer an opportunity to reply before this report can be made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.834" offset="21594676">In addition to which, the report itself is limited to reporting on public officers and public employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.881" offset="21630934">Now, while this is a contractor which may have in one or two aspects be doing certain work for a public agency, certainly, none of the officers or employees of this corporation would deem to be public officers or -- or public employees and under the New York State decision on the subject, I don't even believe under this Section that a report can be handed up except to recommend the changes in the law but it cannot bring to the attention of an administrative agency the misconduct of a public contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.878" offset="21786833">It is wholly without the scope of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.599" offset="21833749">Now, with respect to standing, I believe that the Attorney General in his brief, attempted to say that this was a situation which was not covered by the Pierce or by the Joint Anti-Facist Refugee Committee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.706" offset="21906160">I believe, however, that in an analysis of this, it would have to be an inescapable conclusion that this corporation just as the corporation in Pierce was entitled to raise the issue as to whether its business or property were taken away without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.232" offset="21988289">In addition to which and this was mentioned by learned friend, Mr. Hessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.791" offset="22014516">In Holland against Hogan case which is number 653 in the October term and which is a petition for certiorari, the Attorney General argued exactly the converse of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.315" offset="22068642">In that case, the individuals are applying for certiorari here and he has argued that it's the corporation that was disqualified and therefore the individuals have no standing, the corporation must bring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.927" offset="22123081">Now, I submit the Attorney General of the State of New York cannot have it both ways either we have standing here or in the Holland against Hogan case there is standing and under the circumstances since we're dealing with exactly the same statute, may I state that this Court should pass upon the constitutionality of the statute which I believe deprives the corporation not only of due process but its individual officers of the guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.124" offset="22251917">Thank you.</text>
