            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 65, Poafpybitty et al.petitioners versus Skelly Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.503" offset="197360">Mr. Johns, you may proceed to your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Hill Johns</label>
            <text syncTime="27.554" offset="213556">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.048" offset="231528">The petitioners in this case are Comanche Indians residing of the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.324" offset="268622">They own some lands that were originally allotted to their predecessor under the General Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.031" offset="323480">The lands are restricted against alienation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.361" offset="348766">Under the General Allotment Act, these Indian owners are permitted to make an oil and gas lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.360" offset="400802">But the oil and gas lease must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.777" offset="426506">They lease some lands to Skelly oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.579" offset="441657">Skelly Oil Company drilled; sell in wells on the property, produced oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.034" offset="475512">They flag the gas into the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.298" offset="500590">Petitioners filed suit against Skelly asking damages, money damages for a breach of the expressed and implied governance of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.146" offset="563911">And notified the United States, invited them to come into the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.430" offset="593063">They did not elect to come into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.663" offset="614066">A trial course sustained a demurrer which is comparable to the motion to dismiss federal practice and it would appeal to the Supreme Court in the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.944" offset="671117">The Supreme Court in the State of Oklahoma held by reason of the federal restrictions against alienation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.539" offset="713540">These Indian lessor do not have the capacity to bring a suit for damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.178" offset="764113">After the Supreme Court had so held by appropriate proceedings, we filed an application for a certiorari which was granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.410" offset="816985">The United States at the invitation of the Court, I have filed a brief amicus curiae and the United States supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.256" offset="868394">So simply stated it is our position, the only one question here is whether Indian lessors in a departmental oil and gas lease have the capacity to institute and maintain a suit for damages without the joiner the of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.203" offset="996185">Now, there is no question that the United States had a perfect right to bring such a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.786" offset="1026487">It's our position the Indian lessors have their right to bring such a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.449" offset="1061177">The case is here as the Court please, on a question of the pleadings that ended demurrer was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.502" offset="1093360">All the allegations of our petition must be taken as proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.961" offset="1123244">In other words, we think we should be permitted to bring a lawsuit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.970" offset="1171205">It is our theory that the restrictions against alienation are for the protection of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.321" offset="1228675">That the United States will not permit certain Indian citizens the right to alienate their lands but that restriction if Your Honor please, goes to the same to the alienation of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.468" offset="1333269">It is our position and we submit that it was never the intention of the Congress that an oil and gas lessee such as the respondent in this case would be entitled to benefit by using these restrictions against the Indian and saying that the Indian does not have the right to bring a lawsuit to recover what he thinks he is entitled to receive by reason of a breach of the lease contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Hill Johns</label>
            <text syncTime="386.754" offset="1650395">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.047" offset="1651545">I think that's right sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.462" offset="1657187">And that is the same situation that applies in any number of different matters as we point that out in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.618" offset="1697834">But I do not believe if I may say, if Your Honor please, I do not believe that that is the determining test.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.293" offset="1748511">The test in this case, if the Court please, is whether or not there has been an intended sale or alienation of the property that is when the federal restriction applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.788" offset="1826565">Now, and we pointed out in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.511" offset="1841403">There are some language in the early decision, the Heckman case that of this Court, that indicates clearly that the -- a member of the five civilized tribes or the United States Government could bring a lawsuit pertaining to a departmental oil and gas lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.480" offset="1953311">Some time after that in the Tenth Circuit, there was a case Seitz versus Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.500" offset="2005347">In that case reviews of all the authorities were set out in that opinion that is referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.722" offset="2042232">And the Tenth -- and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, squarely held that either the Indian or the Indian Tribe or the United States could bring such a lawsuit as we seek the right to bring it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.395" offset="2137004">Now, it is quite clear that the opinion of the state court in this case based to its decision solely on the question of these restrictions prevented the Indian from bringing this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.743" offset="2238360">Skelly Oil Company may have raised two or three, other what I think, at least to be interesting question.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.015" offset="2279424">One question they raise is they say the Supreme Court of Oklahoma could have decided this case on grounds other than what they did decided on.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.037" offset="2331564">I do not think that is the inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.861" offset="2354866">I think that when the opinion of the States' Supreme Court squarely basing it this decision on federal regulations, federal laws then it is our position that this Court has jurisdiction to determine whether or not such a decision were sound or unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.640" offset="2473984">There is another interesting matter, at least to me, that while the case was in the Supreme Court, Skelly Oil Company filed a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.356" offset="2528841">The motion to dismiss were denied to dismiss the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.990" offset="2555382">However, in denying the appeal, the Supreme Court stated that in the future a different rule would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.137" offset="2611911">In other words, Skelly Oil Company has argued that because a motion to dismiss was denied by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma their lives have been offended under the Federal Constitution because they have been denied to equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.112" offset="2691845">Now, this Court in the Great Northern case that I have said had passed squarely on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.765" offset="2734477">That was an interesting case, if Your Honor may please the state court in Montana have ruled and adjudicated the question about tariffs in a previous decision known as the Donnie case when the merit came up to the Supreme Court again in the Great Northern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.084" offset="2851715">The Supreme Court of Montana said, “We're going to overrule the Donnie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.723" offset="2874284">But we're going to apply the rule in the Donnie case to the Great Northern Case and that our ruling here is only prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.450" offset="2917125">This Court in that case held that such a decision did not offend the rights of the Great Northern under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.556" offset="2973550">And it's interesting that the Oklahoma Court in writing its opinion on the motion to dismiss followed the Great Northern decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.715" offset="3030183">I have referred to reserve the balance of my time Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.484" offset="3089324">Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.700" offset="3114193">This case contains a much deeper involvement and that indicated by state friend who has proceeding being at this electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.650" offset="3182007">As will be indicated I hope by the very brief time which I have to state its various ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.283" offset="3220459">I do believe by way of preliminary that the opinion and decision of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is much broader in scope and deeper in depths than that indicated by my friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.722" offset="3310216">In addition to that, I do believe also that under many previous decisions of this Court, I may present to this Court with proprietary matters concerning which the Supreme Court of Oklahoma did not speak consistent with the decree or the decision which was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.614" offset="3429857">If the matters were there presented and either erroneously decided or ignored and for that I have no less authority than the language of Mr. Justice Cardozo in Morley Construction Company against Maryland Casualty Company, 300 U.S.185 and 191 which I would briefly refer without a cross appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.266" offset="3544482">An appellee may urge and support of a decree any matter appearing in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.550" offset="3577605">Although his argument may involve and attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.018" offset="3635493">So with that in mind, I think I have just found an outlining to Your Honors the various points which are necessarily involved in a proper decision of the issues in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.672" offset="3694111">Initially, a feel I may say with propriety that I regret and even deplore the suggestion contained in some of the briefs that the decision of the two courts in Oklahoma contrary to the claims of the Indians were the result of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.383" offset="3792854">I believe that the record will indicate beyond per adventure of a doubt that that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.759" offset="3822425">That the doors of the courts were not closed to these Indians and that they had every possible proper consideration are their cause under the procedures of a forum deliberately chosen by the petitioners for the advancement in their cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.394" offset="3924929">And in that connection I think it is quite proper also to indicate here very briefly and it is covered in the brief more fully, that upon the matter of what the issues were and what kind of a case it was the petitioners were seeking to present, the petitioners made to the trial court a deliberate election of choice of the kind of an action they wish to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.188" offset="4032136">And said to the trial court, “If you will not require us to elect between the two different types of actions which might have been wrong, we will state to Your Honor that hereafter this will be treated solely as an action upon the contract to recover royalties due to the petitioners under the terms of the Department of Lease.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.211" offset="4144253">Now, I say that to Your Honors by way of preliminary because while it is not been definitely stated here in argument, it is clear from the greatest which have been filed and the position of the petitioners below that their theories of their right to maintain this action to successful conclusion are predicated upon the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.974" offset="4247280">In Heckman versus United States in the 212 U.S. 412, 224 U.S. 412, and upon an Act of Congress which as I recall is referred to as the Hasting Act in 1926, applicable only and solely as specifically to the five civilized tribes of which of course the Comanches are not among the number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.900" offset="4370996">The Heckman case is not authority for the maintenance of this action to successful conclusion because the Heckman case contrary to counsel's statement did not involve an attempt to recover upon a departmental lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.422" offset="4441109">But involved in action by the United States itself or the cancellation of numerous and as I recall running into thousands are Cherokee restricted Indian's deeds attempting to convey their allotments contrary to the restrictions imposed by Congress and extended by the congressional enactment of 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.775" offset="4558451">The holding in that case after reviewing the treaties with the Cherokees, the holding in that case, a very extensive opinion, was boil down to its ultimate statement that the United States being the guardian of the Indians and the five civilized tribes owe the duty to prosecute upon the behalf of the individual members of those tribes actions to recover interest in their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.202" offset="4696168">And then by way of what I shall refer to as considered victim because I wouldn't wipe and decide or attempt to believe with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.597" offset="4733785">This Court said in that connection, of course the Indian may bring his own action to recover his interest in tribal lands and if the United States wish to take over the action, it could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.780" offset="4822497">And following that, there has been some little use of that victim in cases that are entirely different from this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.941" offset="4863143">And I may say to Your Honors that, under the law which is applicable to this particular kind of case both under the procedures adopted under the code of procedural Oklahoma and the federal statutes and the federal decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.296" offset="4932524">There cannot be a successful recovery by the Indians in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.211" offset="4964185">Now, Your Honors I would like to have you bare with me a moment while I indicate to you what I consider to be a distinction between an action brought under the Court in Oklahoma to recover an interest or to protect an interest in the lands and an action like this one which is brought to recover alleged royalties due by way of damages or otherwise under and because of the terms of the departmental lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.858" offset="5094797">There was no departmental lease involved in the Heckman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.558" offset="5113605">The other statutory provision to which reference has been made as first seen possibly some indication of authority for the Indians to maintain this suit to successful conclusion is as I indicated the Act of 1926, which itself is specifically limited in its effect to lands and the civilized tribes and of course by his very language is not applicable to these Comanches.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.349" offset="5884740">Now, I'm going to show to Your Honors that royalties if they're indeed on this waste gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.896" offset="5914937">If it was waste gas were recoverable are on the contract and not separate and a part from the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.258" offset="5952449">And that's where I get to the basic law which controlled this case and which up to now has not been mentioned the oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.639" offset="6005948">60 statutes at large 939 designate the powers which the Secretary of the Interior should have with respect to these restricted lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.168" offset="6064044">It's also cited as 25 U.S.C.A 1 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.324" offset="6088704">And it authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe extensive rule and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.739" offset="6122350">And the Secretary has done so and it has been a time honored process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.062" offset="6143666">When acknowledged by the Court says legal and proper and consistently upheld through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.798" offset="6170520">And in all the circuits where Indian Affairs have been involved and in this Court where they have found their way and that has been the consistent holding of the courts that these rules and regulations construed in the light of the statutes authorizing them are -- have the force and effect of law and will be read into a release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.796" offset="6262575">So that here, we have a situation where the rights of the parties, lessor and lessee, are determinable from the phase of the lease aided and supplemented wherever necessary by the rules and regulations adopted by the Secretary of the Interior for the carrying out of this guardianship of the Indian wards of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.950" offset="6363199">And consistently throughout, those regulations you will find that the only type of a lease which these Indians could have made was a departmental oil and gas lease prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior furnished by him, required -- requiring the lessee to take that kind of a lease and requiring the lessors to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.902" offset="6454941">In it there is reference to these rules and regulations and the lessee and the lessors are required by the terms of the lease and to abide by the terms of the rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.645" offset="6505932">So that when you come to a determination of who can prosecute what kind of an action you must have reference to those rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.128" offset="6555878">The lease itself says that, “These parties may not declare a termination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.208" offset="6584195">And when I say these parties, I mean the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.817" offset="6594644">These petitioners may not declare a determination or bring about in any form a cancellation of this lease as long as they are restricted and can have no action at law or in equity to accomplish that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.174" offset="6656084">In addition to that, the rules and regulations specifically provide that in the case of waste and this question of what is waste under these regulations is a very involved and serious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.142" offset="6707911">What it provides the regulations provide that in the case of a waste of gas, determined waste of gas, a royalty shall be paid sets by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.962" offset="6755244">Not to be less than five cents for every 1,000 cubic feet of the gas waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.228" offset="6780322">But along with that determination and whether or not there ha been a waste of gas, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized through his subordinates, to whom he may delegate the authority, to manage the operation of the lease hold estate created by this departmental oil and gas lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.579" offset="6861720">So that the lessee is required and every step of the way in the operations of the oil and gas leases in their drilling, in their production and their sale, to account to the Secretary of the Interior and he has his agent on the ground directing the operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.047" offset="6939564">And the complaint in this case itself shows that in this particular case, the wells which were producing oil were also producing gas and that the gas was being vented and because there was no market for the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.328" offset="7012707">And that went on with the approval of the supervisor until such time as the market was found for the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.790" offset="7042487">And there is a potent, very sound economic reason for it which the Secretary of the Interior through his supervisory doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.958" offset="7083238">There were five wells or seven wells surrounded by other wells which were being produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.957" offset="7119182">Unless these wells were produced, the oil would be drained from under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.931" offset="7143111">And the only way they could be produced would be to flare the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.521" offset="7161501">In order that the person the gas would force to this high gravity oil to the surface which could be marketed and during this whole period during which this gas was flared, the oil was taken under the direction of the supervisor, marketed, converted it into money, and paid into the hand of the Secretary of the Interior according to the terms of the departmental lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.356" offset="7256795">So that when it's our Court came to consider the federal law and we concede without hesitation that the federal law control this question of who could proceed on that lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.552" offset="7317608">What could be recovered on it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.202" offset="7324191">How the lease had to be operated?</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.281" offset="7340492">And above all, what protection the lessee got from following the directions of the interiors -- Secretary of the Interiors supervision?</text>

            <text syncTime="2572.701" offset="10394206">There are ifs and ands about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.764" offset="10402461">For instance, the question of asset of double exposure is discussed and it is very clearly stated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.219" offset="10596289">We notified the Government of the pendency of this action at the earliest opportunity and invited the Government to come in and take the action over and the Government refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.570" offset="10645608">Now, if there has been a determination by the department that the Government couldn't win or shouldn't prosecute this action then I think it only stricken the proposition that unless the hands of the Secretary are upheld unless his regulations are enforced and unless the scheme of regulation which the Congress itself has specifically provided for.</text>
