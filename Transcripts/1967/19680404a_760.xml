            <text syncTime="67.174" offset="372067">That, I do not (Voice Overlap) [Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="72.464" offset="393279">I did not review the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.759" offset="414386">The case involves the construction of Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.647" offset="445942">This is a provision which deals with what are called divisive reorganizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.132" offset="471855">Some reorganizations put corporations together and Section 355 deals with situations where they're taken apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.151" offset="503933">In the jargon of the trade, Section 355 includes such things as split-ups, split-offs, and spin-offs.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.568" offset="545625">And the transaction involved here is or may be or maybe is not a spin-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.165" offset="576031">Now the question is whether it comes within the terms of the statute which provides that there is no income on the receipt of stock or securities on a spin-off when the requirements of the statute are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.691" offset="638098">A spin-off arises in a situation where a corporation has a subsidiary and distributes the stock or securities in the subsidiary to its shareholders without the shareholders giving up anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.616" offset="705808">There is no exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.115" offset="715839">The general theory is that the shareholders have two pieces of paper representing the same interests which they had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.756" offset="750425">Now where the terms of the statute are complied with, it is provided that no gain or loss will be recognized on the receipt of securities in a spin-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.851" offset="810820">The problem here arises on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.744" offset="834330">Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, which we will call Pacific, for many years has operated telephone service in California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho, and through a subsidiary in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.540" offset="901517">Since 1907, more than 80% of the voting stock of Pacific has been held by American Telephone and Telegraph Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.680" offset="946134">And in 1961, which is the year and the only year before the Court, AT&amp;T owned about 90% of Pacific's common stock, about 78% of Pacific's preferred stock, and had nearly 90% of the voting power in Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.306" offset="1040593">During the late 1950s and in 1960, Pacific in the process of evolving its management of this great enterprise developed a plan to decentralize its operations by separating out its business in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.159" offset="1139963">It organized a new corporation called Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company and which we refer to as Northwest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.293" offset="1196596">In creating a new corporation, it transferred a small amount of cash to Northwest for stock and then it transferred all of its assets in Oregon, Washington and Idaho to Northwest in exchange for the balance of its stock and debentures.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.884" offset="1282905">At this point, July 1, 1961, Northwest exists as a complete operating corporation wholly owned by Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.682" offset="1350092">If Pacific had then distributed all of the Northwest stock and securities to its shareholders, there would have been no doubt that this was a spin-off and that no gain or loss would be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.576" offset="1417697">Indeed, the same result would have happened, subject to certain conditions, if Pacific had distributed at least 80% of the Northwest stock to the Pacific shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.924" offset="1471091">This would have been a spin-off and thus within the terms of the statute, making the distribution tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.911" offset="1507035">However, Pacific chose not to proceed in this way and that's why the problem arises here.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.387" offset="1548936">Instead of distributing all of the stock or at least 80% of it, Pacific chose to issue warrants or rights to its shareholders in 1961 through which they or persons who purchased their rights could buy not all or 80% but 57% of the Northwest stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.151" offset="1672025">Under the rights offer, it took six rights and $16 to acquire a share of Northwest stock and $16 was less than the market value of the Northwest stock so that the rights had value.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.096" offset="1747780">At the time when these rights were issued, Pacific had what it denominated a plan in which it was stated that Pacific expected to dispose of the rest of the stock through further issues of rights, the time and prices to be determined later.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.762" offset="1838373">However, Pacific was under no obligation to make such a disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.556" offset="1865644">It did in fact issue further rights in 1963, 21 months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.401" offset="1904933">As a result, all of the Northwest stock was eventually disposed of either to the Pacific shareholders at the two separated points of time or to the persons to whom such shareholders sold their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.217" offset="1992286">In the first of the cases before the Court, the Gordon case number 760, the shareholder received rights in 1962 and exercised them.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.794" offset="2046516">The question is whether he had income from this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.273" offset="2072430">In the other case before the Court, the Bann case, number 781, the shareholder exercised all of his rights but four.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.051" offset="2115584">As I've said, it took six rights plus $16 to subscribe to a share of Northwest stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.322" offset="2148707">Mr. Bann exercised all of his rights that he could to get full shares, but he had four leftover, and he sold those four.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.094" offset="2195728">The question in the Bann case with respect to the receipt and the exercise of the rights is the same as that in the Gordon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.036" offset="2235538">In the Bann case however, there is the additional question as to the tax liability arising with respect to the four rights which were not exercised but were sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.683" offset="2290082">At the time the transaction was under consideration, counsel for Pacific submitted the question to the Internal Revenue Service for a ruling and that ruling is set out in full at page 146 of the record dated June 28, 1961 just before the transfer occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.786" offset="2410559">The service rule that the transaction did not fall within Section 355 and that the shareholders would be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.483" offset="2449324">Of course that ruling isn't binding on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.329" offset="2464684">I mention it however to show the position of those charged with administering the tax laws and to show further that Pacific and its shareholders were not taken by surprise and that there would be nothing unfair if it should eventually be concluded that the treasury's contemporaneous ruling was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.637" offset="2573876">After the transaction was carried out and returns for 1961 had been filed, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined deficiencies against the two taxpayers now before the Court, who, as I have indicated, had received and exercised rights, but had not included anything in their tax returns with respect to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.366" offset="2688815">The taxpayers filed petition for review with the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.119" offset="2711803">In a careful opinion by Judge Raum, the taxpayers prevailed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.986" offset="2739284">Judge Raum held that since a distribution of the Northwest shares to the Pacific shareholders without payment would have been tax-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.943" offset="2783169">It could not be supposed that Congress intended a tax liability to result from a lesser distribution, that is an offer to dispose of the shares at a price through rights as the transaction was actually carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.092" offset="2867702">From the decision of the Tax Court, two separate appeals were taken; one to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the Gordon case and the other to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the Bann case.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.235" offset="2944293">The Second Circuit decided in favor of the taxpayer in a two-to-one decision with Judge Friendly dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.758" offset="2982431">The Ninth Circuit decided in favor of the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.373" offset="3004897">Thus, there was a square conflict of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.450" offset="3025168">Both sides filed petitions for certiorari and these are the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.561" offset="3053589">Both arise on the same record which are now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.342" offset="3088697">Before going further, I would like to point out that this case arises in the same basic area as was involved in the famous Gregory case in 293 U.S. decided in 1935, I suppose all tax lawyers would agree one of the great landmarks in the tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.153" offset="3191933">The Gregory case involved a spin-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.868" offset="3210846">At that time, this was an area which had come to be used very widely for rather blatant tax avoidance which was the situation in the Gregory case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.620" offset="3261837">As a result, not only was the Gregory decision announced from this Court, but Congress repealed the provisions which had been included in the earlier revenue laws granting tax-free status to spin-offs.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.436" offset="3325158">And there was no provision for tax-free status of spin-offs between 1934 and 1951, a period of 17 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.272" offset="3372492">Now, let me make it plain that in this case, there's no doubt that there was a substantial and legitimate business purpose and for the steps which Pacific took with respect to its Northwest operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.292" offset="3432573">The reference to the Gregory case however does seem to me to be relevant because it shows that Congress knew that this was a delicate area with substantial tax avoidance potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.755" offset="3498402">As a result, when Congress first restored a tax-free status to some spin-offs in 1951, it included careful restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.776" offset="3558484">These restrictions were extended and amplified in the 1954 Code, Section 355 which is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.386" offset="3608952">In the light of the background of the spin-off provisions and the language which Congress actually used, it is our position that Congress contemplated that the language of the statute would be carefully read, that its requirements would have to be met, and that it could not be given a broad and sweeping construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.520" offset="3717413">The statutory provision involved here is the same sort of provision as that relating to collapsible corporations, which was involved in Braunstein against the Commissioner in 374 U.S. where the Court referred to the statute there as setting up “a carefully and elaborately defined category of transactions”.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.688" offset="3834128">We have such a provision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.612" offset="3849801">Let us turn then to the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.369" offset="3872893">As I've said at the opening of the argument, this is a technical tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.270" offset="3896404">Much of the technicality is developed in the main briefs and the reply briefs which have been filed by both of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.338" offset="3932766">I'm going to try to keep my argument relatively simple focusing attention on three provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.300" offset="3968606">If more detail is wanted, it will be found in ample amounts in the briefs which have been prepared for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.358" offset="4008835">The full text of Section 355 appears at several places in the papers before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.041" offset="4043525">The place to which I shall refer is in the appendix to the government's main brief, the usual gray-covered brief, beginning at page 53 of that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.639" offset="4101935">Section 355 is a part of subchapter (c) in the Internal Revenue Code relating to corporate distributions and reorganizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.292" offset="4152508">It follows Section 351 which deals with transfers to a controlled corporation and Section 354 which deals with exchanges in connection with a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.829" offset="4230666">Section 355 is itself entitled distribution of stock and securities of a controlled corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.226" offset="4276328">As you will see, it's a long provision occupying nearly all of four pages in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.366" offset="4316871">Generally speaking though, we need be concerned only with that portion of the statute which appears on page 53 and the top of page 54, that is a total of one and a half out of the entire four pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.435" offset="4397119">The rest of the provision is important as a part of the setting of the statute since it illustrates the care with which Congress drew the provision and its apparent concern that its term should be specific and carefully safeguarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.677" offset="4478098">Let us then look at paragraph (a) (1) of Section 355 as it begins on page 53 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.543" offset="4533582">It starts off with one important condition imposing word ‘if.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.910" offset="4555003">It says, “If a corporation referred to in this section as the distributing corporation; (i) it distributes to a shareholder with respect to its stock”, distributes to a shareholder with respect to its stock, or, and then we can skip (ii) as it has no application here, what does the corporation distribute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.160" offset="4700035">The section then continues, “Solely stock or securities of a corporation”, referred to in this section as controlled corporation, which it controls immediately before the distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.396" offset="4764923">Now, I would suggest that the important words there are in (i) distributes to a shareholder with respect to its stock, and then the words immediately following (ii) solely stock or securities of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.797" offset="4846529">Now, in examining this statute, we can skip the provisions of paragraphs (B) and (C) at the bottom of page 53 and go over to the next page, page 54 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.769" offset="4910477">We there find (D) as part of the distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.693" offset="4938167">The distributing corporation distributes; (i) all of the stock and securities in the controlled corporation held by it immediately before the distribution, or, and then, there's a longer (ii) and which makes it applicable if they do distribute 80% and certain other conditions are complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.118" offset="5051852">Then, no gain or loss shall be recognized to and no amount shall be includable in the income of such shareholder or security holder on the receipt of such stock or securities, which is a consummation devotedly to be wished by any taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.626" offset="5149863">The question before the Court is whether what was actually done by Pacific's management here meets the terms of the provisions of Section 355 to which I referred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.407" offset="6580955">In other situations, and I submit that this is one, the statutes are written in a highly articulated manner and are clearly designed to be read specifically and not in general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.969" offset="6647202">Broadly speaking, I think that this is the line on which this case will be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.340" offset="6672697">If one looks only at the general situation as the taxpayers' counsels do as far as they can, reasons may be found which will lead to a conclusion their way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.554" offset="6733615">On the other hand, if one looks at the statute and gives a fair construction to the language actually used by Congress, it will be found I submit that the conditions of the statute were not met and that the tax-free status sought by the taxpayers was not achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.252" offset="6824417">So let's look at the terms of the statute with the facts of the case in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.513" offset="6853465">In doing this, I would recall that the issue arises because Pacific chose to use warrants or rights rather than distributing the Northwest stock to its shareholders outright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.889" offset="6910934">If Pacific had done the latter here, there would be no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.514" offset="6929429">Why should the result be different, simply because they did something less?</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.039" offset="6955551">The answer is I think that the one would have complied with the terms of the statute while what was actually done did not, and the difference is not entirely formal for a distribution of all of the Northwest stock to the Pacific shareholders would have been a true spin-off, a division of the same enterprise into two, with each shareholder of Pacific now owning two pieces of paper to represent exactly what he owned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.513" offset="7145409">But what was actually done was quite different and not within the spirit of the statute, as well as not within its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.020" offset="7191489">What was actually done was a refinancing of Pacific, a sale of a part of its Northwest stock in 1961 for a very large sum of money which reviews for the expansion of Pacific's operations in California, as well as to pay off part of its indebtedness to AT&amp;T.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.917" offset="7303084">Pacific shareholders did not simply receive the Northwest stock as Section 355 contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.517" offset="7337462">They had to buy it and to put large sums of new money into Pacific in order to get their shares in Northwest, or else to sell or lose their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.978" offset="7403290">Now, how does this fit in into the actual terms of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.217" offset="7424188">Let's look again at the beginning of Section 355 (a) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.915" offset="7451042">If a corporation distributes to a shareholder with respect to its stock, did Pacific distribute Northwest stock to its shareholders with respect to its stock?</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.760" offset="7526379">I suggest that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.104" offset="7539754">In actual fact, Pacific made two distributions or dispositions in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.631" offset="7577893">This is illustrated by the fact that there were two separate mailings of distinct items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.289" offset="7608508">First on September 29, 1961, it distributed rights to its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.775" offset="7642467">That was certainly a distribution but was it a distributed stock in Northwest, no, rights to the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.695" offset="7674128">This was a distribution to its shareholders with respect to its stock, but it was clearly a distribution of rights, not of Northwest stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.065" offset="7723656">No shareholder received Northwest stock at that time and no shareholder would receive Northwest stock at a later time unless he took affirmative steps which he was under no obligation to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.929" offset="7791052">At a somewhat later time, Pacific did sell Northwest stock, but not to its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.590" offset="7833684">The sales were made to the then holders of warrants or rights who might or might not have been shareholders of Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.458" offset="7873181">Indeed, the record shows that about a third of the minority shareholders of Pacific did not exercise their rights and did not receive Northwest stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.705" offset="7982164">There was a – a before issuance market and a market during all the time that they were outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.700" offset="8022183">This is what, in the Bann case, the problem we had with respect to the four rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.315" offset="8044648">In that case, they sold the four rights and the question arises as to the taxability of the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.887" offset="8078921">The important matter in the application of the statute is that Northwest stock was not distributed to the Pacific shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.171" offset="8124061">It was in fact distributed to whatever person's owned and presented the rights, together with $16 for each share of Northwest stock to be acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.901" offset="8174947">This is not what the statute says and the refinancing, which was carried out is not what was contemplated when the statute was formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.039" offset="8235551">One element in that picture, which I think is relevant is that the spin-off statute, it seems to me quite plainly contemplates that the size of the distributing corporation will be reduced after the distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.583" offset="8305664">Now, you have a corporation which has a subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.516" offset="8321442">It distributes the subsidiary and the old corporation is left with reduced assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.090" offset="8355715">In this case, as far as the book value is concerned, the result was an actual increase of the size of Pacific after the distribution because the book value to Pacific of the Northwest shares was less than the $16 a share which it received on the distribution of each share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.435" offset="8441083">That is what gives rise to the capital gain, which Pacific recognized and returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.163" offset="8472012">There's one element in this picture, which makes me a little nervous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.540" offset="8497507">It was suggested for the first time in the Second Circuit's opinion when the Second Circuit said that well, really, this was a distribution of Northwest stock to the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.558" offset="8549648">And what the shareholders did then was to make a contribution to the capital of Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.127" offset="8571904">They treated the $16 as a -- or they said it could be treated as a contribution to the capital of Pacific rather than as a payment of the purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.679" offset="8622059">Well now, if it's a contribution to the capital of Pacific, it would not be taxable income to Pacific, and I see lurking in the background here a claim for refund by Pacific on the ground that this was a contribution to capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.389" offset="8680887">It seems to me that that is extremely far-fetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.592" offset="8697710">The transaction was referred to in the plan as an offer to sell the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.584" offset="8717667">It was understood by all as an offer to sell the shares and it seems to me that it should be treated as a sale, both in this case and with respect to Pacific.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.240" offset="9140328">What they paid for -- well, their bases is somewhat complicated because it involved the amount that they had invested in assets in those three states, which they then distributed to Pacific in exchange for Pacific's stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.073" offset="9195708">Now, the argument that I've just made with respect to 355 (a) (1) (A) (i) applies too to the following portion of the statute which requires that there be a distribution of solely stock or securities of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.417" offset="9273031">And I would point out that that word ‘solely' was added in 1954 when Congress enacted the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the corresponding provision which was put in 1951 did not have the ‘solely' there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.818" offset="9342621">Now, the taxpayers can't have it both ways, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.904" offset="9359026">Either there was a distribution of rights, in which case, it was to a shareholder with respect to his stock but was not a distribution of solely stock or securities. Or there was a distribution of Northwest stock, although it was more accurately a sale, in which case, it was made to the right holders and thus was not a distribution to a shareholder with respect to its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.608" offset="9473755">It's not enough to say that the two parts were some sort of a step transaction and that they are to be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.008" offset="9511372">Even that will not bring them within the statute as written, nor will it mean that Pacific distributed solely stock or securities in Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.765" offset="9558392">As this Court said in the Southwest Securities Corporation case, 315 U.S., “Solely' leaves no leeway”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.795" offset="9602591">What Pacific distributed here was rights representing an obligation against Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.389" offset="9636968">Such rights are not solely stock in Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.183" offset="9664136">Finally, there's another provision of the statute which was not met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.113" offset="9683780">This is on the next page, page 54, Section 355 (a) (1) (D) at the top of page 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.553" offset="9721605">It provides that the distributing corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.099" offset="9735816">Here, Pacific, must distribute; (i) all of the stock and securities in the controlled corporation held by it immediately before the distribution, while the following paragraph (ii) qualifies this, if at least 80% of the stock is distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.027" offset="9839470">In this case, even if the issuance of rights in the sale of Northwest stock in 1961, is treated as a distribution of stock, it was only 57%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.830" offset="9902686">The required aggregate of at least 80% can be reached only if the 1961 distribution is added into the -- in with the sale of the remaining 43% of the Northwest stock which did not occur until 1963, more than 21 months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.101" offset="10003728">And the important thing about this is that it was not obligating in any way in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.340" offset="10044688">This can best be seen by examining the plan for reorganization which is set out in full beginning at page 102 of the record, and I would call your attention particularly to the relevant portions of the plan on page 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.460" offset="10145207">This was carefully drawn so as not to subject Pacific to any obligation as to future distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.722" offset="10186271">Note the first line on page 109, “It is expected that within about three years,” and then further down the page, in the second paragraph, the third line, it's provided that the offering price will be determined by the Board of Directors of the company at the time of each offering and then, the next sentence begins it's expected that, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.352" offset="10340812">Now plainly, we suggest that this does not square with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.627" offset="10369860">The words in Section 355 (a) (1) (D) (i) held by it immediately before the distribution connote some sort at least of a limited time within which the distribution of all of the stock must be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2668.186" offset="10776116">After all, I just referred to the text of the plan for reorganization and bringing in a witness who would say, “Well, we didn't really mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.938" offset="10819166">What we had in mind was that we were bound to do it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.620" offset="10829824">It seems to me would not affect the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.003" offset="10855424">Now, in referring to the reference to immediately before the distribution in Section 355 (a) (1) (D) (i), we don't suggest that everything has to be done in an instant or even on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.345" offset="10940792">Obviously, time for the mechanics of the transaction must be allowed, but there must be some sort of a limited time within which the distribution should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.830" offset="10994709">If it's to be done in two stages, they must be at least reasonably close together and what's more important, committed from the beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.359" offset="11188851">I wouldn't even be sure of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.852" offset="11194807">I could imagine that you could have a situation where there is a distribution in December, a distribution in February, all planned and committed, and I would suppose that that could come within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.546" offset="11265546">Certainly, it makes it easier if it's all within the same taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.924" offset="11295117">Our only position is that when they are widely separated and quite non-committed, that Section 355, in the light of this language, cannot fairly be regarded as applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.606" offset="11365752">Leaving the thing in limbo for 21 months is not only contrary to the basic approach, always followed by Congress' annual accounting periods, but it is inconsistent with the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.927" offset="11451120">And thus, as is discussed in more detail in our briefs, we contend that the disposition or sale made here did not meet the requirements of Section 355 because only 57% of the stock of Northwest was sold in 1961, and there was no commitment to dispose off the rest of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.679" offset="11570134">Now, there's a remaining issue in the Bann case, number 781.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.166" offset="11596048">The taxpayer there sold four of his rights and the majority of the Court of Appeals held that he was taxable on the proceeds at capital gain rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.939" offset="11651114">We've discussed this point at the conclusion of our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.159" offset="11672012">It's our contention that the decision below on this is wrong because the distribution of rights did not come within Section 355 as it was obviously not a distribution of solely stock or securities in Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.822" offset="11750693">Indeed, this point highlights our argument on the main point in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.764" offset="11778382">A good deal of reference is made in the opinions below and in the briefs to this Court's decision in Palmer against Commissioner back in 302 U.S. Where in an opinion by Justice Stone, it was held that the issuance of rights did not constitute a distribution by a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.834" offset="11882663">The premise on which that opinion was based however was that in that particular case, the rights were issued at the fair market value of the distributed stock as of the time the rights were determined on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.975" offset="11951313">There is a language in the Palmer case which it seems to me Justice Stone probably would be reexamining himself if he were here to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.144" offset="11999901">But I would point out that regardless of the Palmer case and its status now, the Congress substantially amended the statute by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, adding a whole new subchapter (C) spelling out in much greater detail the provisions with respect to distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.018" offset="12095404">And we would contend that the Palmer case is no longer applicable, whether it was rightly or wrongly decided, and that Section 301 and other sections of the code squarely call for the treatment of the rights on receipt as being taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.157" offset="12187982">Now, it is convenient with respect to rights which are usually short-lived to withhold taxability until the rights have been disposed of and to treat the proceeds of the rights as being the dividend or distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.314" offset="12260603">And ordinarily, this makes no difference, although we suggest that the better analysis is to say that the rights are income at their fair market value when they are received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.669" offset="12313997">And that there is then a capital gain or loss, ordinarily a short-term gain or loss, on the sale of the rights depending upon whether they were sold for a little more or a little less than they were worth when they were received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.138" offset="12383901">In this case, such a gain or loss would have been a short-term gain or loss all in the same taxable year so that the result of the amount -- the result of taxing the amount received on sale is a convenient and wholly accurate way to treat the transaction, but we suggest that it should be treated as a dividend distribution and not in any sense as a capital gain or loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.589" offset="13677693">There are two issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.810" offset="13686575">One issue arises with respect to the exercise of the Northwest rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.722" offset="13710294">The other issue relates to the sale of the Northwest rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.585" offset="13729729">The Solicitor General misspoke in referring to the sale issue as arising in the Bann case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.056" offset="13759613">Actually, it arose in the Gordon case and the Bann case involves only the exercise of rights issue, the same issue that is involved in the Gordon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.435" offset="13837145">Addressing myself first to the exercise issue, I should like to review briefly the facts giving rise to the reorganization that is in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.143" offset="13903914">Pacific operated the telephone business in the four western states, California, Washington, Oregon and Idaho prior to July 1, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.561" offset="13969638">This territory experienced enormous growth in the post-war period, so much so that it was apparent that extreme administrative difficulties were being generated by the expansion which was taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.877" offset="14038915">The company therefore undertook a study to determine whether or not it was desirable to divide Pacific into two or more corporations and this study took place over a period of about two years, which begun in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.951" offset="14111222">The result of the study was that it was desirable to divide the business of Pacific into two corporations, one which would have all of the business and assets in the three Northwest states, and the other the remaining operations in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.435" offset="14205158">The reasons for the division were to have a management and a board drawn from the area served so that there would be a better understanding of the service needs, so that there would be better relations with customers, employees, and government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.564" offset="14325635">The plan to divide the Pacific company had nothing whatever to do with devising a means of raising capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.901" offset="14367013">Based on this study, it was determined to proceed with the division of the Pacific company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.843" offset="14390732">The most obvious way of affecting this division would be by transferring all of the assets and business in the three Northwest states to a new corporation, and then simply distributing the stock of that corporation pro rata to the Pacific shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.546" offset="14465546">Such a distribution would have taken the form of a dividend and would have had to be charged to the earned surplus of Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.683" offset="14502118">Pacific did not have sufficient surplus for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.717" offset="14522284">Accordingly, counsel for the company advised Pacific management that under the California law, it could not create Northwest and distribute the Northwest stock directly to the Pacific shareholders without the payment of any consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.992" offset="14611310">The plan then devised in conformity with the California law was to affect a distribution of a Northwest stock by rights offerings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.249" offset="14668361">The Northwest assets represented about 20% of Pacific's business and when Northwest was created, it had a net worth of approximately $575 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.634" offset="14733876">In order to induce the Pacific shareholders to retain their proportionate interest in Pacific in the form of Northwest stock, the price at which the stock was offered was fixed at approximately 40% below the fair market value of the Northwest stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.462" offset="14837217">These rights represented in effect, part of the equity of Pacific shareholders since 20% of the company had been transferred to Northwest, and the rights were the means in conformity with the State Law whereby Pacific distributed the Northwest stock to the Pacific shareholders so that they could retain their equity in the Pacific company.</text>

            <text syncTime="3718.879" offset="14978905">But that isn't quite so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.675" offset="14986115">Isn't your company, Pacific distributed the stock less $16 per share, in effect that's totally shortly enough, either that the $16 was either -- either has to be subtracted as a practical matter from the value of Northwest or you have treat it as a capital contribution -- I'm just talking about the net effect of the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3748.851" offset="15098755">The net effect is to increase the capital of Pacific, but it need not to be considered, as the Second Circuit considered it from a tax standpoint, as a contribution to capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.478" offset="15145253">It can be considered as I will develop later in my argument as simply a sale of the Northwest stock to the Pacific shareholders because of a sale under the Palmer case decided 30 years ago and which has been followed by the Commissioner ever since a sale is a distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3781.448" offset="15229158">And that's the way it was set up actually in the plan, wasn't it, as announced to the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.629" offset="15253922">It was set up as a sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3790.388" offset="15264893">Yes, Your Honor, so that the rights or the means whereby the Northwest stock was distributed to the Pacific shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.888" offset="15306898">Now, the opposing views of the Commissioner and the taxpayers are not simply that the transaction involving the receipt of Northwest stock is tax-free under Section 355.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.382" offset="15392893">Much of the argument made by the Solicitor General is addressed to the proposition that the receipt of the Northwest stock, through the rights offerings, is not governed by Section 355, but the Solicitor General has not stated what it is and what the Commissioner has contended resulted to the receipt of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.513" offset="15497383">And it might be pertinent to look at the question, which was so properly asked by the Second Circuit Judge Moore -- which is set forth in the appendix at 275 and turning to the top of page 277, pointing to the fact that when the taxpayers exercise their rights, they simply receive the same and retain the same equity that they have before, only they have two pieces of paper, certificates in Pacific and Northwest instead of simply certificates in Pacific representing their ownership in the Pacific Corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3905.362" offset="15724857">That is true, but the payment of cash into the corporation should not be a vice to a tax and I will advert to that Your Honor if I may in pointing to the question raised by the -- by Judge Moore and which properly was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.795" offset="15806568">As I have stated, he pointed to the fact that when Pacific decided to have his assets held by two corporations instead of one, the taxpayer simply had two pieces of paper instead of certificates in one corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.549" offset="15869576">And the question is asked, “How this corporate change of asset ownership, brought income, and if so, where is it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.049" offset="15907610">Here, the taxpayer wound up with the same equity, they paid $16 a share in the Pacific and the Commissioner asserts that somehow or other, they received a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.906" offset="15955048">Now what is the subject of the dividend?</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.579" offset="15961736">What form does it take?</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.012" offset="15971453">The Commissioner now suggests that it takes the form of the rights which were received although I shall deal with that in the course of my argument, the Commissioner had ruled that the subject of the income, the distribution, was not the rights but was a stock and yet the stock represented to retain ownership in Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.755" offset="16086392">These rights had a three-week duration, by their terms they expire, they are worthless after three weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.741" offset="16126307">They require the payment of cash into Pacific in order for the shareholders of Pacific to retain their same equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.177" offset="16168103">The effect of the Commissioner's determination in finding that this transaction resulted in income is to hold that where the taxpayer simply paid money into the corporation to retain their same equity that somehow or other, they received the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.137" offset="16263920">And as an added element of harshness, the Commissioner asserts that the retention of this equity not only resulted in income, but resulted in ordinary income, a dividend income.</text>

            <text syncTime="4639.461" offset="18661230">The rights were a mechanism designed to affect a distribution of the Northwest stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.933" offset="18687143">The testimony showed that a rights offering would be successful if only a 10% under pricing were used if the rights -- if the offering price was only 10% less than the expected fair market value of the stock subject to the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.831" offset="18778676">In this case, in order to ensure that the Pacific shareholders would retain their same proportionate interest in Pacific insofar as possible, consistent with the necessity of not dipping into Pacific's surplus so that Pacific could conform to the California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.890" offset="18874911">The price at which the Northwest stock was offered was 40% less and the fact that the under pricing was successful is established by the great majority of the shareholders who exercised their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.796" offset="18954533">Now the statement was made that approximately one-third of the minority shareholders did not exercise their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.918" offset="19007091">The record shows that not less than two-thirds exercise their rights and a large number of rights were exercised through brokers and it is common knowledge that stockholders will use brokers as a matter of convenience in the exercise of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.481" offset="19093295">So a great many of the rights that were exercised through brokerage firms, we believe, were exercised by Pacific shareholders, but in response to your question as to whether the difference between the value of the stock subject to the rights offer and the offering price makes a difference, conceivably it could, but not under the facts of this case because the record overwhelmingly establishes that the rights mechanism used here was for the primary purpose of getting the stock, the Northwest stock, in the hands of the Pacific shareholders.</text>

            <text syncTime="5552.490" offset="22313357">That would have been a violation of the California law and Pacific was so advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.153" offset="22340002">Therefore, when in conformity with the California corporation law, the stock rights method was used in order to avoid charging surplus, the offering price was fixed at an amount in excess of book value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.315" offset="22412622">Now necessarily, that figure involved the payment into Pacific of very, very large sums of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.313" offset="22448671">The total amount paid in under the rights offerings was approximately $480 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.168" offset="22500080">Because of the fact that the rights offerings would involve such a large inflow of capital, it was necessary to take cognizance of that and not raise capital as Pacific had customarily by issuing its own securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.960" offset="22579179">It was -- Pacific then was requiring about $250 million a year and prior to 1961, it had been issuing its own securities, its own debentures and its own stock in order to raise capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.370" offset="22648874">But because the distribution of the Northwest stock in conformity with the California law required the payment of capital into Pacific, it was unnecessary for Pacific during this interim period to resort to issuance of its own securities to raise capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.159" offset="22739989">And necessarily, because Pacific was a public utility, it could not have on hand properly large sums of unused capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.323" offset="22796622">In the interest of the shareholders and the ratepayers, it would have been improper for Pacific to have a large amount of unused cash, lying in the banks and yielding a low rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.876" offset="22870915">Now, I have dealt with the Palmer case and I think it might be pertinent here to talk about the -- whether or not the 1954 Code changed the rule in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.064" offset="22919607">As I said, that rule was accepted by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.248" offset="22936325">It's embodied in a general counsel's memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.145" offset="22947924">As far as I know, the administrative practice of the Commissioner for 30 years has been to follow the Palmer case, that there is no -- that there is no income, no distribution when rights are issued, that when the rights are exercised, that's when the distribution takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.264" offset="23036426">In fact, in the rulings that were issued in this case -- in these cases, the Commissioner applied the Palmer doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.896" offset="23087000">The Commissioners rulings sated that there was a distribution of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.476" offset="23113226">The property was in the form of a Northwest stock and the Commissioner further said that the receipt of rights was not taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.955" offset="23159202">Now, I wish to point out that the Commissioner's theory here before this Court is not only contrary to his long-established administrative practice, but it's contrary to the rulings that he expressively made in the -- in connection with this reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.909" offset="23227016">Now, as to the 1954 Code, the Commissioner relies on a change in the definition of property, and the contention made is that rights are therefore property and when they're issued, there is a distribution of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.113" offset="23311862">Well, as I pointed out, the Palmer case turns not on the concept of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.684" offset="23334118">It turns on the concept of what is a distribution and there was no change made in the 1954 Code in language of the statute dealing with distributions of property as dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.092" offset="23407783">Not only there was a no change in that language, but Congress, in the committee reports stated that Section 301 which embodies this language substantially was the same as the corresponding provisions in the prior law which were involved in the Palmer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.778" offset="23506526">There is no indication whatever in any of the Committee reports that Congress ever made any change in this important rule, in this backhanded fashion by simply dealing with what I consider was a drafting clarification in the definition of property and we've explained that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.277" offset="23604433">It's a highly tactical point, but I think that it's perfectly clear that there is no basis whatever for the assertion that Congress intended to make any change in the 1954 Code with respect to the Palmer rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.897" offset="23690951">And after Palmer case is applied, there is a distribution because Palmer said that a sale of property to shareholders of a corporation is in a literal sense, a distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.366" offset="23748838">There is also a distribution solely of stock because the subject to the distribution is not the rights, but a Northwest stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="6498.769" offset="26098500">The legislative history shows clearly that in connection with Section 355, Congress wished to do a way with forms in corporate mechanics in determining whether or not a device of reorganization would be treated as tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="6520.704" offset="26186167">It wanted to deal with the substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6522.958" offset="26195153">The effect of transactions and the reason for it is because of the history of the spin-off, so called spin-off provisions if I maybe permitted to use the tax jargon here which the Solicitor General referred to which occurred in the Gregory case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.004" offset="26271431">Now this case is the antithesis of the Gregory case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6546.884" offset="26290866">In the Gregory case, the taxpayer used a form of spin-off in order to affect what was essentially a distribution of earnings and profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6563.027" offset="26355440">It was a tax avoidance scheme pure and simple that followed the form of the statute, but the substance was exactly the opposite of what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="6574.408" offset="26400998">Therefore, when it became apparent that the spin-off provisions could be abused, in 1934, the Congress did away with a spin-off provision but it retained all of the other device of reorganization, the split-ups and the split-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.086" offset="26479679">And the reason is clear because the Congress at all times evinced the policy of encouraging the division and the breaking up of corporations, rearrangement of corporate structures with essentially the same ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="6612.991" offset="26555329">Therefore, it was impelled to reinstate the spin-off provision in 1951, but it did not reinstate it in the form in which it was put in 1924 when the Gregory case and all of that litigation arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.802" offset="26618546">There was a qualification in the statute as it stood in 1951 which showed clearly that Congress did not want the spin-off provisions to be abused by using that form of device of reorganization as a means the getting earnings and profits out of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.201" offset="26716139">Therefore in 1954, when there was a complete overhaul of the code, a reexamination of all of the provisions of the code and in particular the corporate reorganization provisions, Congress placed the emphasis on substance and not form.</text>
            <text syncTime="6676.034" offset="26807463">And in one Section, Section 355, it dealt with all types of device of reorganizations and it said regardless of the mechanics, the forms, the corporate forms used whether it's a spin-off or a split-off or a split-up, as long as in substance, there was no distribution of earnings and profits then that change of corporate ownership, change in corporate structure on their audit form would be permitted to take place on a tax-free basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6712.057" offset="26951555">The purpose of Congress, I think, in doing that is well set out in the committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.801" offset="26986559">The committee report is referred to in the Commissioner's brief on page 2 of his reply, but unfortunately, he has omitted from the text which is quoted, the entire language which shows clearly that Congress wished to be exceedingly liberal with respect to readjustments and rearrangements of corporate structure but to tighten up on the distribution of earnings and profits so that the substance, the effect of the transactions would control.</text>
            <text syncTime="6760.532" offset="27145488">The full text of that statement in the committee report which I have referred to appears in the taxpayers' brief on pages 33 and 34 and I would like to read one statement in that report that I think is pertinent here, “Thus, your committee would liberalize present law with respect to the non-recognition of gain or loss in cases which involved mere rearrangements of the corporate structure while at the same time, providing less liberal rules in other areas in order to ensure that transactions which are in substance, although not in form, dividend distributions by corporations to their shareholders are subject to tax at ordinary income rather than a capital gain rates”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6819.844" offset="27382784">Now what do we have here?</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.593" offset="27389785">We have precisely what the committee was dealing with, the rearrangement of corporate structures with essentially the same ownership and this, the statute was designed to permit to be accomplished on a tax-free basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6845.285" offset="27484557">The changes that were made in the prior law by the 1954 Code through Section 355 are set out in the brief of the taxpayers, the opening brief on pages 34 and 35, and they show clearly that Congress in dealing away with a necessity for pro rata distributions and making it unnecessary to form a holding company which would take over the stock of a controlled corporation and be the subject of a tax free spin-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="6885.633" offset="27645889">Congress was concerned with eliminating all of these corporate mechanics, but it wanted to make sure that there would be no use of Section 355 to distribute earnings and profits in the four conditions two of which had been relied on by the Commissioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6907.936" offset="27735124">The four conditions in Section 355 are all designed to implement this overall concern of Congress that there'd be no distribution of earnings and profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.114" offset="27791862">Now when the taxpayers exercise their rights, when the Pacific shareholders exercise their rights, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="6929.842" offset="27822791">Was there any distribution of earnings and profits?</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.103" offset="27839822">Assuredly not because all of the property and net worth that had been in Pacific was then in two corporations, Pacific and Northwest and was still available for distribution of dividends to be taxed when as and if distributed, but not until then.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.406" offset="27936998">Now, turning to the precise language of 355 (a) (1) (A), taking that language as it should be read in its ordinary meaning and in the context in which the Section appears, it is our contention that we meet all of the conditions prescribed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6992.398" offset="28072939">In Section 355 (a) (1) (A), a corporation referred to in this Section as a distributing corporation distributes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7007.981" offset="28135320">Assuredly there was a distribution here under the Palmer case, the transfer of corporate property to a shareholder is a distribution even though it might be called a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="7020.870" offset="28186833">As the Palmer case says, a sale literally is a distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7026.289" offset="28208567">And the language is precisely the same in Section 301 which seemingly the Commissioner agrees, includes a so called sale or on pages 6 and 7, the reply brief of the Commissioner, the statement is made and I quote, “There is such a distribution with respect to stock only when the sale is a bargain, the price is less than value”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7060.181" offset="28344090">In that circumstance which is the present case, the item distributed is the value of the bargain measured by the spread between the price and the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="7070.348" offset="28384737">It is submitted that what is distributed is not an item of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="7074.894" offset="28402918">What is distributed is property and the property that was distributed here was the Northwest stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="7086.233" offset="28448266">With respect to its stock, as our brief shows clearly, means simply the recognition of the shareholders in their capacity as such and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="7102.461" offset="28513259">We believe that we complied in every way with the terms and conditions of Section 355.</text>

          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="7146.623" stopTime="7369.900">
            <label>Mr. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="7146.623" offset="28689847">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the full quotation from the committee report is given accurately in the taxpayers brief in the footnote at the bottom of page 33 and 34 and I have -- I agree with it entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="7166.476" offset="28769259">The Congress wasn't trying to remove unwarranted restrictions, unnecessary or desirable business practices but it was also including provisions to ensure that this would not be misused and there's nothing in that paragraph in the Committee report which even suggest that the language which the Congress actually used in the statute is not to be read as having its meaning and to be applied the way it was written, and that gets us back to our contentions about the three particular paragraphs of the statute where it seems to us that the provisions of the statute were not met by the distribution of rights as distinguished from the distribution of shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="7218.434" offset="28977089">The counsel has referred to the fact that rights were used here because there were difficulties under California law and they couldn't have distributed the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="7232.027" offset="29031528">I think that's, perhaps, exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7239.050" offset="29059532">Pacific had able counsel here and I don't think it would have been above or beyond their capacities to have developed a recapitalization which would have produced capital surplus, which would have enabled the distribution to be made if that's what they'd wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7257.808" offset="29134555">The fact was that they wanted very much, they needed desperately, we're fortunate that we have an excellent management available there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7267.065" offset="29171649">They need it desperately to have large amounts of new capital to provide for the rapid growth of the business in California and as the Tax Court pointed out on its opinion on page 240 of the record, this was the dominating factor which determined their use of rights rather than the distribution of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="7290.070" offset="29263600">Then I would like to point out that rights are property, there's no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7295.985" offset="29287320">One other problems in this case is that both sides have to try to deal somehow or other with the Palmer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7304.111" offset="29319816">I don't think that the Palmer case is a barrier to the government's position here nor necessarily a barrier to the taxpayers' position, but I think it's perfectly obvious that rights are a property.</text>
            <text syncTime="7317.728" offset="29374255">All one would have to do would be to consider a theft of the envelope containing the rights or a question of property tax liability with respect to rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="7328.350" offset="29416782">And there is a very important factor here in that Congress didn't make changes in 1954 and they were more substantial than my other learned brother has indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7339.657" offset="29462026">I would call a particular attention to Section 317 which is new in the 1954 Code and which defines property in such a way as clearly to include rights to subscribe to shares in another corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7355.952" offset="29527228">We would welcome a reexamination and a clarification of the Palmer case along the lines indicated in our brief.</text>
