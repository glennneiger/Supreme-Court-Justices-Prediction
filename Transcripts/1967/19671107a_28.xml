            <text syncTime="1042.566" offset="4273612">And therefore, under no circumstances, just to cover the approach that Your Honor made yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.471" offset="4313213">At best, the Court could have under 19 (a) merely sent the case back to include Dutcher as an involuntary plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.174" offset="4344038">The majority opinion for reasons which we do not understand seemed intended to establish a substantive complex and to work the thrust of the modern approach in Rule 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.996" offset="4403388">But if I may just briefly sketch this -- the approaches that we -- that are to be taken, if the majority opinion approach is taken, then there will not be just a possible conflict as Mr. Harvey points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.094" offset="4467754">But there will be three poss -- or four possible conflicts, because under Pennsylvania rules, each of these cases would be litigated and then each of these various claimants would then have to bring a separate garnishment action and you could get three separate conflicting approaches as to the coverage question, which would be a sheer nightmare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.692" offset="4578095">The declaratory judgment action in this case was the most economical way of determining the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.417" offset="4601083">Now, under 19 (a), if Your Honors were to send it back under 19 (a) to make Ducther an involuntary plaintiff, then being the law of the case that the Pennsylvania Dead Man's Rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.877" offset="4670882">And by sending it back under 19 (a), the Court recognizes the interest of Dutcher and it has been argued here as to the interest of Dutcher by counsel for the insurance company, then it means the various estates would prevail because under the Pennsylvania presumption, Dutcher could not testify and again they would get their directive verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.738" offset="4754369">And the only person who could suffer would be the live plaintiff who was severely injured and he might get a conflicting result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.756" offset="4790418">And Lumbermens gets an opportunity to relitigate that issue and submit that again toa jury which I humbly submit they do not deserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.229" offset="4840260">They've had their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.313" offset="4848619">Under no circumstances can Dutcher suffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.227" offset="4860322">Now, it has been argued that Dutcher may be found a defendant in the Delaware County cases and then he can sue the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.900" offset="4906924">But as Your Honors pointed out, only the insurance company would suffer thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.001" offset="4931375">But even under those circumstances, under the opinion suggested -- under the order suggested by Judge Freedman in his dissenting opinion, the judgment here would await the resolution of those Delaware County cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.228" offset="5000234">If Dutcher is found not guilty in this action, and there's a good chance of that because all he did was hand the keys to these men and these men took the car away and Cionci was driving at 90 miles an hour and crossed the median strip, the likelihood that Dutcher would be found guilty as a defendant is highly unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.567" offset="5069615">And if he is found absolved in those Delaware County cases, then there is no conflict at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.816" offset="5098663">And Lumbermens pays the -- judgment that been found in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.826" offset="5122696">And it is significant as I pointed out yesterday that despite the fact that Lumbermens represents Dutcher in those cases, those cases have stayed on the books for eight years even though Delaware County is a short docket county and they've done nothing to resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.857" offset="5190823">But taking Judge Freedman's opinion one step further, we as the counsel for the claimants and the counsel for all claimants are in this Court today, we are willing to accept a conditional order which says that we will limit our claims against all the defendants including Dutcher to the $100,000 policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.550" offset="5309524">So that by affirming the order of the lower court and making it conditional, then Dutcher has no danger at all and in fact he hasn't any, and Lumbermens has no danger of paying out more than their contractual limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.124" offset="5375875">And this can be done under 19 (b), the whole thrust, and that's the importance of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.376" offset="5404923">Ninth -- New Rule 19 set up various means by which this whole concept of indispensable party can be put aside for pragmatic considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.405" offset="5456959">And the rule makers kept using that word pragmatic consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.476" offset="5477230">It is not at all unknown for a court to so do, to put a condition on the affirmance of an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.422" offset="5509099">And we would accept such a condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.226" offset="5524250">And under that posture, and we set this in our brief, Lumbermens has not met that challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.952" offset="5551208">They have not answered this premise as I advanced yesterday and as I advanced now, the reason for that is that Lumbermens wants to relitigate this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.216" offset="5588198">They want a second day in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.481" offset="5597288">And I say to Your Honors, this case has been on the books for nine years and it was no fault to the plaintiffs that it was on the books for nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.848" offset="5622784">The Court of Appeals sat on this case for almost two years for reasons which we do not understand and then ordered an argument in bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.667" offset="5666043">This case was ordered on the trial list within five months after it was first filed, so that we have not delayed, but it has been in courts for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.286" offset="5720482">This Court has within its power, the opportunity to terminate this litigation by making such a conditional order and all counsel have authorized me to say that they would accept such a condition, that all the claims of all the plaintiffs will be limited to the insurance coverage of a $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.986" offset="5799267">The issue has been litigated under -- the importance of this case is that the Rule 19 gives the opportunity to the Courts to use these pragmatic considerations to be practical as opposed to the impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.895" offset="5862902">And this is the first important case under Rule 19, and this case could be a guide stone to the lower courts in getting away from this rigid approach to the indispensable party context.</text>
