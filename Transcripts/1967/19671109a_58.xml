            <text syncTime="22.804" offset="194539">This case Your Honors involves election under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act in which Cecil Dial (ph) the union’s incumbent business representative was defeated in his campaign for reelection by Andrew Jackson, his rank and file opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.731" offset="294327">Dial protested of his defeat only to the International Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.841" offset="318777">His protest was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.748" offset="326405">He complained again to the Secretary about his defeat only and eventually a supervised election was directed by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.372" offset="368828">Simultaneously were the regular 1966 scheduled union election and Dial was again defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.226" offset="408325">The Secretary now seeks to set aside the 1963 election of officers, which was never protested or challenged and those terms have long expired and to expunge the untainted 1966 election, which was never challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.250" offset="500381">We submit that the statute does not warrant what has been referred to as laboratory election or the remedial intervention of the Secretary under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.157" offset="836002">The union held its regular triennial election in June of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.438" offset="865155">All nine officers except that of business representative were filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.473" offset="885217">Here a tie resulted between Dial, the incumbent who had been in office for sometime and Andrew Jackson, his rank and file opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.730" offset="922311">This election was not challenged, but because of the tie, it became necessary to conduct a runoff election in July of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.687" offset="970167">This runoff election like the predecessor election in June was supervised by a secretly elected rank and file committee of election judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.656" offset="1025964">Dial lost this election, the runoff election to Jackson by some 19 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.322" offset="1052609">He filed a timely protest only about his loss of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.518" offset="1073403">He was not concerned about any other officer, but only about himself and he intended only to protest his own defeat.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.299" offset="1108616">Dial was accorded a full hearing by the International, a complete hearing, on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.363" offset="1136828">He was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.255" offset="1144351">The union representatives were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.382" offset="1152920">A full inquiry was made and it was made clear to the International hearing panel that Dial was protesting only his own defeat.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.372" offset="1196910">He was not concerned about anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.683" offset="1210075">Because Dial was unable to substantiate the proof that enough ineligible members voted to affect the election result, the International denied his protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.357" offset="1272769">He then made a timely appeal to the Secretary and the Secretary conducted an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.456" offset="1305161">This investigation or the results of the investigation were made known to the International Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.767" offset="1342464">The Secretary claimed that he had in the investigation uncovered irregularities in the June election as well as in the runoff election and was therefore asking the International Union to set aside both the June regular election and the July runoff election.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.493" offset="1445386">The International Union questioned the Secretary's jurisdiction to set aside an election which had never been protested and which had not been considered by the International Union in its hearing's panel, but did say to the Secretary that if proof of irregularities in the runoff could be further substantiated, it would reopen its record and again consider the runoff election.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.996" offset="1567326">Within a week or ten days after that, the Secretary filed a suit in the district court of northern district of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.972" offset="1603271">Now two questions it seems to me Your Honors are presented in this posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.790" offset="1626572">Did the intervening election in 1966, held in conjunction or connection with the supervised election for business representative moot this case and in any event, we submit it may have been further mooted because the International in October 1966 after the appeal had been filed in the Court of Appeals amended its constitution to prevent in the future any occurrence of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.269" offset="1752482">But if the Court should hold the election as not moot, then there is a further issue before perhaps and that is the authority of the Secretary to include violations not complained of by any union member and never considered by the union and whether the Secretary has a free-wheeling investigation upon which he can uncover any violation never complained of by a member or never considered by the union and file a complaint based upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.266" offset="1892394">Now these issues arise because filing -- following the filing of the secretaries broadened complaint, a motion was made in the district court to dismiss all allegations of the complaint pertaining to the June in 1963 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.787" offset="1966477">And the district court granted that motion claiming that the member had never exhausted any remedies concerning the June election.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.005" offset="2011408">No protest concerning the June election had been made by any member to the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.303" offset="2032619">The International had never considered it and under the language of the statute there was no jurisdiction in the court to entertain a complaint based upon those allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.557" offset="2077550">Now almost two years later and I think Mr. Claiborne yesterday perhaps inadvertently created the inference that this happened right after the district court had come down with its motion to dismiss, but almost two years later in April 1966, the district court Judge Battisti granted the government's motion for summary judgment with respect to the remaining portions of the complaint dealing only with the runoff election concerning which there had been a protest, concerning which there had been a hearing and concerning which the Secretary had under the statute conducted his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.606" offset="2261765">Summary judgment was granted with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.203" offset="2284231">The district court Judge Battisti, in his decision of April 1966 recognizing the imminence of the oncoming June 1966 election and the practical problems that would be raised, directed that the supervised election for business representative be conducted at the same time as the regular election.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.173" offset="2412022">And so representatives of the Department of Labor and union representatives met and laid out the details of the supervised election.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.961" offset="2463222">Now this was no casual meeting Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.625" offset="2477850">This was a detailed, deliberate, considered arrangement of all of the details that go into a union election even down to and including the color of the ballot that would be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.182" offset="2544097">So on July 11, 1966 the government got its supervised election, Department of Labor representatives were present, the other officers were filled at the same time --</text>

            <text syncTime="661.344" offset="2748792">Now Dial again lost this election, but the day before the election on July 10, one day before this election, the Secretary appealed, Court of Appeals from both Judge Connell's order of July 1964 and Judge Battisti's order of April 1966, the union moved to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals on the union's motion agreed with it that the supervening event, the supervening event in 1966, the regular election occurring simultaneously with a supervised election rendered the Secretary's case moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.495" offset="2949308">I may say at this time in answer to a question of Mr. Justice White raised yesterday, there is not an iota of evidence, not a scintilla of an inference that there was anything wrong with the regular election in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.085" offset="3023705">It's clean, absolutely clean and I think Mr. Claiborne must concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.534" offset="3057560">Now the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act is a unified scheme to protect the rights and interests of union members and the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.071" offset="3103640">I think there has been a lack of presentation, if I may say so, concerning both the structure and the content of the statute which this Court must consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.189" offset="3148152">Under section 402, on complaint of a union member, it must be a union member, the Secretary after investigation may bring a civil action to set aside the invalid election, not a later election, not any other election, but the election found to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.909" offset="3239058">In the meantime pending this conclusion, the election even though challenged is presumed to be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.572" offset="3269674">It allows the elected officers to continue to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.033" offset="3283466">This I think was a deliberate choice Congress made rather than move, remove the challenged official.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.777" offset="3314500">Somebody had to run this union or the union and they were permitted to remain so that the affairs would not descend into chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.423" offset="3357027">But it's the election or the election contest that was challenged, that's investigated and whereupon trial a preponderance of the evidence if it reveals that a violation may have occurred then a court is then authorized to declare the election void in the conduct of a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.998" offset="3443336">Thus in 1966, when the union officers who had been elected in 1963 completed their terms of office, the Secretary's action was moot, these terms of office had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.454" offset="3505194">Resulting from the invalid, unchallenged election, the terms of office had expired and the allegedly invalid, unchallenged election was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.025" offset="3563499">The officers who were now holding office in 1966 came in as a result of an unchallenged, un-protested election.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.618" offset="3609893">No purpose would be served now by an order in 1967 or perhaps in 1968 to conduct a wholly new supervised election.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.992" offset="3651375">The Secretary has had his supervision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.721" offset="4114265">This is because of a strict interpretation placed by the Secretary upon the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.132" offset="4151881">It's because of that strict interpretation placed upon it and that the union in October 1966, the International Union in October 1966 amended its constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.052" offset="5071600">I need to repeat the Dial's complaint, the incumbent business representative, his complaint to his union and to the Secretary was a very limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.145" offset="5111933">He asked the union only really to give him back his job because he had been defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.270" offset="5136488">He asked the Secretary to investigate an election held July 13 at local 125.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.166" offset="5172015">This was all the relief he wanted, but the Secretary's legal action was a broad complaint based upon the alleged irregularities of June and the alleged irregularities of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.955" offset="5227186">Now, the statutory language it seems to me, Your Honors which is set forth in the amicus brief of AFL-CIO shows in our judgment conclusively that the Secretary exceeded his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.792" offset="5290506">The language of the statute is quite clear in Section 402 that it is a member who has exhausted his internal remedies and only then may he file with the Secretary, may complain alleging a violation of Section 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.555" offset="5361560">The Secretary investigates such complaint, not any complaint or all complaints but such complain and then if he finds probable cause to believe the violation occurred, he brings the civil action to set aside the invalid election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.518" offset="5429478">The Secretary may vindicate only what the members complained of and shown to exist and he's limited, in our judgment, to the member's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.238" offset="5472319">Dial intended, there is question about, this was made abundantly clear at the hearing accorded to him by the International Union, there is no question that he intended to protest his own defeat and loss of office and it is exhaustion of that one issue, did not furnish the necessary predicate for the Secretary to go in and seek to set aside the June election never challenged or the other irregularities allegedly uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.844" offset="5610768">If there is any theme that seems to me which appears throughout the legislative history, is the congressional concern for exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.831" offset="5654653">There may have been other legislative differences as to how to approach the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.459" offset="5677223">There were differences of opinion in the Senate Bills and House Bills, but one thing does appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.614" offset="5701778">All of the legislators agree that the primary basic predicate was exhaust remedy and then complain to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.662" offset="5754023">This is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.315" offset="5760606">The self discipline and habits created by International Unions in according to complaining members, through hearing panels an opportunity to disclose their complaint, the development of an informed leadership and an alert and aware membership is fostered by these internal unions processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.457" offset="5853184">Now in answer to a question yesterday put to Mr. Claiborne by Mr. Justice Black, in substance, “Once a complaint is made, do you uncover the entire area?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.089" offset="5911698">And Mr. Claiborne if I recall correctly said, “Yes, this is the rule which we wish to apply and we need laboratory election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.740" offset="5958301">We cannot accept this, what I call, a trigger theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.628" offset="5985886">The adoption of this theory means that once a union rejects a limited complaint by a member, there maybe no justice for it and no substantial basis for the complaint, but the Secretary then may conduct a free-wheeling investigation, file a complaint, covering violations never even thought of by the member or complained of and considered by the International Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.749" offset="7862418">I'd like to address myself to the suggested distinction between the case in which the violation has recurred in the supervening election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.134" offset="7911946">In this case all we know it did not recur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.704" offset="7934203">The suggestion being that in this case, Secretary's suit is mooted because there has intervened a clean action or as perhaps in the previous case as Mr. Justice Fortas put it the gravamen of the offense, the gravamen of the charge remains because the taint continued through the second election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.659" offset="8037961">It seems to me that that distinction between an apparently clean supervening election and equally tainted supervening election, although appealing at first is both contrary to the statutory scheme and an unworkable basis of the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.719" offset="8130226">As to the statutory scheme, the statute might have provided that where there is an invalid election and the court so finds then the court shall order that the election be rerun free of the taint, it might have left at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.062" offset="8211623">It did not, Congress did not choose that remedy instead of which it said the election shall be rerun under the supervision of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.603" offset="8261778">That was presumably to assure not only that this particular violation would be eliminated in the rerun, but that other violations, new violations would be eliminated if they were to reintroduced at this rerun election.</text>
