            <text syncTime="29.628" offset="221915">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.210" offset="236231">This is a felony murder case brought in form of proffers and certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.079" offset="271653">The petitioner, Eddie McArthur Harrison is in the D.C. jail serving a life sentence imposed following his third conviction in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.044" offset="327555">Affirmance of that conviction by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and a denial of rehearing on en banc by that court, six members of that court over the dissent of Chief Judge Bazelon and Circuit Judge Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.392" offset="408952">In this Court, the petitioner raises two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.771" offset="426506">First, whether testimony given by him at a former trial to rebut confessions erroneously admitted and illegally obtained could be used against him at the retrial as part of the Government's direct case on the question of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.043" offset="519502">And second, whether he has been denied a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.708" offset="538206">The record giving lies to these questions is long and unusual but the facts are fairly simple and not really on dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.375" offset="576867">The petitioner and two other boys, Joseph Samson and Orson White, were indicted on April 1, 1960 for the felony murder of one Syder George Brown, a fence and gambler.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.975" offset="639248">At the trial, the principal evidence against them was a set of confessions which admitted that Syder George Brown had been killed during the course of an attempted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.528" offset="689507">At the trial, the boys took the stand and testified that the confessions were false and had been obtained by threats and abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.151" offset="727960">The truth was, the petitioner explained, that Syder Brown had been killed accidentally during an innocent attempt to pawn a shotgun with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.433" offset="781145">Now the jury convicted, the boys, were sentenced to death which was the mandatory sentence for felony murder in the District of Columbia at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.417" offset="829001">Thereafter shortly, it was discovered that one of the counsel who had participated in the case was not a lawyer at all but an imposter, one Daniel Oliver Wendellholmes Morgan who had substituted himself for one L.A. Harris, a real lawyer who had left the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.060" offset="907577">The Court of Appeals immediately sent the case back to the District Court with instructions to receive and grant motions for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.566" offset="945612">But the boys sitting down in the district jail on death row refused to file such motions and repudiated them when they were filed on their behalf by the court appointed counsel because the boys did not want to waive their right to be tried but once for the same crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.245" offset="1036309">There the matter sat for a number of months until the Court of Appeals eventually ordered a new trial for the boys despite their refusal to ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.678" offset="1094092">At the second trial, again, the confessions were introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.901" offset="1106944">Again, the boys took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.137" offset="1111960">Again, they were convicted, only this time they were sentenced to life imprisonment, the mandatory death sentence in the District of Columbia having meanwhile been abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.988" offset="1151352">There followed an appeal and the case was argued challenging -- basically challenging the admission of the confessions that have been used against him in some other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.417" offset="1197014">It was argued in December of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.495" offset="1213315">There the matter sat for some 18 months until the Court of Appeals on its own motion ordered rehearing en banc sua sponte on the question of the admission of one of the petitioner's confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.255" offset="1280397">Case was reargued and some six months later or two years after the original argument, the Court of Appeals issued a decision holding all of the confessions inadmissible because they had been illegally obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.239" offset="1480286">At the third trial with the confessions gone, there was no real evidence of felony murder, but the prosecutor supplied that lack by reading the testimony given by the boys to rebut the illegally obtained and inadmissible confessions at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.542" offset="1557504">He also had three live witnesses and he read some other testimony from the second trial, but this other testimony didn't really make out a case of felony murder and if that had been all there was to it, the case might have been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.635" offset="1609958">Certainly, it should have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.283" offset="1628453">But Orson White and Eddie Harrison were reconvicted on the basis of their testimony given at the second trial to rebut the illegally obtained and inadmissible confessions.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.659" offset="2678053">By the time of this trial, he was about 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.281" offset="2696547">Now, there was only one chance and that was to go before that jury and try to persuade them that the confessions were false and to give them the boys' own story, incriminating as that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.239" offset="2772302">And so, he took the stand but I don't see how by any stretch of the imagination that could be considered voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.599" offset="2813785">He testified but only under great and improper pressure, improper because it stemmed from illegally obtained evidence erroneously admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.612" offset="2853804">And I think to use testimony obtained in those circumstances is fundamentally wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.225" offset="2880240">When Eddie Harrison was awarded a new trial almost five and a half years after he had first been imprisoned for this offense, the least he was entitled to was a fair trial and he didn't get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.782" offset="2938546">What he got instead was a trial at which he was made the government star witness against his will with words extracted from him by the use of illegally obtained evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.809" offset="3002598">I don't see how a conviction so obtained can be squared with either the Fifth Amendment or the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine under the decision cited in the petitioner's brief, and so I think the conviction must be reversed, but that is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.094" offset="3079711">The indictment against him should also be dismissed because of the long delay in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.855" offset="3110745">It is now more than eight years since the original indictment in this case and Eddie Harrison has been in jail all that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.962" offset="3147212">Eight years is a long time to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.624" offset="3157870">It's particularly long to someone as young as Eddie Harrison that's almost a third of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.393" offset="3176991">It is all of his adult life.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.544" offset="3185560">An examination of the record shows that this great delay was occasioned largely by the failure of the judicial machinery to function well and expeditiously, and the failure was greatest in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.185" offset="3256090">Five of those eight years nearly have been spent on appeals, four of them on court deliberations alone, and two years on that one occasion between the original argument and final decision and at that starting some three and a half years after the case, it already begun and when speedy trial had been argued to them already.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.389" offset="3360893">Now, I understand and I would not dispute that the right of a speedy trial is necessarily relative that it must depend someone on the circumstances that it's consistent with due deliberation and an undue haste is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.676" offset="3426095">But when all that has been said, sometime, somewhere, somehow the right and the guarantee of a speedy trial has to be given meaning and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.117" offset="3475832">The word speedy can only be stretched so far and I think that the Court of Appeals stretched it way beyond the breaking point when it justified the long delays in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.906" offset="3527032">At least the guarantee of a speedy trial must guard against delays that are unreasonable or unnecessary, and the delays in this case were both.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.749" offset="3966412">Now, the Government on brief contends that there is another standard here that it is an essential element of a claim to denial of a speedy trial that the petitioner show that his actual trial, his defense was prejudice in some way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.009" offset="4463365">Well, Your Honor, there were two things that were held to be their own fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.757" offset="4482382">First, the government contended and the court below held that when these boys -- that the whole delay that was occasioned by their refusal to seek the second trial that the Court of Appeals is willing to give them was their own fault because they should have asked for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.736" offset="4554271">And my answer to that is that they shouldn't be required to waive their double jeopardy claim in order to get the speedy trial that everybody knew they had coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.465" offset="4605262">Now, the government here says in answer to that that they could have had both, that there is no reason why they couldn't move for a new trial and maintain their double jeopardy claim, but the government argued exactly the opposite when they were down there on death row faced with that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.859" offset="4670777">At that time, the Government was saying that you shouldn't give them a new trial unless they ask for it because they'll have a substantial double jeopardy claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.500" offset="4701393">So that's one of the delays that these folks fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.575" offset="4721664">Other delays that are attributed to these people and were by the Court of Appeals in its first opinion erroneously involves the time after the Court of Appeals finally made up its mind to go ahead and give them another trial anyway even though they wouldn't ask for it and the time when that trial was actually held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.275" offset="4796479">Now, that period of time on page 8 of the petitioner's brief, we have all the dates pretty well laid out, that period of time was between June 12, 1962 when the first conviction was vacated and the case was remanded until the trial, which took place in April 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.199" offset="4920195">Now, that period of time, there was one month that we're willing to say might be attributable to the petitioner has counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.345" offset="4960737">He asked for a 30-day delay in order to obtain a transcript to the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.653" offset="4986023">Now, whether the need to get a transcript in the form of proffers case is properly attributable or accounted against the prisoner, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.959" offset="5019251">But we have -- but that's all of the time that was really attributable to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.194" offset="5040149">And actually in our discussion of this point and particularly the reply brief, we have dealt rather fully with that period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.808" offset="6086614">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.160" offset="6099989">I think if we accept the premises that petitioner's counsel operates on, he states a pretty convincing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.242" offset="6140322">But I think we have to step back and look at really what he is saying and what his position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.170" offset="6180028">He makes basically two constitutional claims, one under the Fifth Amendment and one under the Sixth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.222" offset="6208240">His Fifth Amendment claim essentially as we understand it is that petitioner was compelled to take the stand at a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.039" offset="6247528">That violated his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, and then the introduction by the government at his third trial of that testimony which had been compelled violated his constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.915" offset="6311058">And he also says that his right to a speedy trial was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.056" offset="6331643">As we understand it, principally because of delay in the Court of Appeals but as well because of the cumulative effect of the long period of time that has gone on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.471" offset="6385246">I'd like to treat first the Fifth Amendment of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.069" offset="6403636">Petitioner of course concedes that if the testimony that he gave at his second trial was voluntarily given in a legal sense that it was admissible against him in his third trial, that so because it's an admission against interest under accepted legal rules what would be probably used by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.765" offset="6502484">But he says that that testimony was not freely given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.172" offset="6516067">He says it was not freely given because it was given to rebut certain confessions that had been introduced and were later held to have been improperly introduced against him at that second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.780" offset="6582523">He states that a little bit differently when he talks about the fruit of the poisonous tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.994" offset="6603316">He says that this testimony flowed from or was the result of these statements that later were held to have been improperly admitted and that therefore his testimony was the fruit of that illegality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.223" offset="6740302">I don't think there's any substantial difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.431" offset="6749080">I think it's mainly one of terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.248" offset="6760364">You do have some different cases you can throw in and different analogies you can draw, but I think in substance, the claim is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.570" offset="6801638">But we start at a somewhat different point than petitioner does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.934" offset="6827133">It has been the accepted rule that, except in very rare instances when a witness takes a stand, testifies under oath that what he says is accountable for and it can be used against him in any appropriate way in a later proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.559" offset="6917622">Now, he had a Fifth Amendment right not to testify at all at his second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.417" offset="6949073">He could remain silent but he didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.534" offset="6969553">Under ordinary circumstances, it seems to us that the case is quite clear that that testimony would have been usable and admissible for any relevant purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.597" offset="7029739">But he says that that's not so, that this is a different kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.190" offset="7056175">He says it's a different kind of case as we understand it because statements had been introduced against him, which were later held had been improperly introduced and that that triggered his taking the stand and therefore, all of that has to be wiped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.477" offset="7133288">The Government can't use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.776" offset="7154500">The matter isn't that simple, I don't think, and we don't maintain that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.890" offset="7178951">We do think that the Court of Appeals that gave extended consideration of the difficult questions involved in this case and I will come to that later in the context of the speedy trial claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.704" offset="7230151">I think that their analysis is as pertinent as anything that I could say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.921" offset="7255019">They said our federal system bestows upon -- this is at the appendix, page 75 -- our federal system bestows upon accused the choice of testifying or not, and permits what he says in the witness stand to be used against him coercively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.269" offset="7320430">The record contains no suggestion that the use of the statements of the second trial was a maneuver to ring evidence from appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.848" offset="7350732">From what it appears, the government's sole objective was to supply missing elements in its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.769" offset="7374451">Here on like situations were duress of some sort has been found, the government exerted no pressure or put no undisciplined and imposed no improper condition on appellant's right to mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.685" offset="7418128">There was uninhibited access to counsel and so far as we can perceive, complete awareness of legal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.572" offset="7445608">We have been referred in no case and our own intensive research is located not holding that the strength of the government's case is itself officiating a form of testimonial compulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.242" offset="8964368">However, it seems to me that there are two very pertinent distinctions between the situation in Simmons, as you may recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.968" offset="8995192">Simmons involved a testimony given at a motion to suppress a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.857" offset="9014836">The motion to suppress was unsuccessful and that testimony was introduced against the -- against Garret actually at the trial and was quite a pertinent evidence of his connection with the suitcase and its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.606" offset="9081814">Now there, as the court pointed out in its opinion, there were two constitutional rights involved, one of the Fourth Amendment, the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures, and one under the Fifth, not to be compelled to testify against one's self.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.404" offset="9140955">Here as we see it, there's one right under the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.115" offset="9463829">Now, getting back to Simmons as I said, the court there pointed out, and we think quite significantly, that defendants might be deterred from taking the stand to support a motion to suppress if they knew that the motion to suppress was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.530" offset="9541465">His testimony could be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.327" offset="9552645">The court pointed out that while the Jones case had taken care of a large number of these kinds of situations that it still remained that there were marginal cases in which this choice would be a difficult one to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.698" offset="9610115">Now, it seems to us that here, there's no question of a surrender of one constitutional right in order to assert another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.101" offset="9643760">That's what the court said in Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.723" offset="9650239">It was something it found intolerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.614" offset="9661837">It said that the practical effect in the Simmons situation was to require an individual if the only way he could show standing and therefore an ability to raise his Fourth Amendment claim was to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.029" offset="9715440">But he either had to take the stand and run the risk of waiving his right not to incriminate if he wanted to assert his Fourth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.761" offset="9758386">We think there's another important distinction and perhaps the most important one between the Simmons situation and this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.895" offset="9790986">In our view, the compulsion which petitioner might have felt to testify here was simply not dictated by any requirement that made his testifying the only way it would raise a legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.898" offset="9846993">In Simmons, that was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.429" offset="9853053">If -- if he didn't take the stand, if he accepted the premise on which the court offered in Simmons, there simply wasn't any way that the individual could make this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.500" offset="9905403">He had a show of standing under our laws as it presently stands and if he didn't take the stand, by definition he couldn't show that and therefore, his Fourth Amendment right went out of the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.053" offset="9955558">This isn't so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.736" offset="9962350">It's quite clear that in order to protect his rights, he had a clear and available way to raise them and that was simply by objecting as he did to the introduction of these statements and if he was vindicated upon appeal as he indeed was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.931" offset="10031104">Now, he said -- petitioner says, “Well, that's all well and good but that's simply no real alternative to me.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.664" offset="10214066">I'd like to mention Griffin versus California in passing because that case was relied upon by Judges Bazelon and Wright in descending from a rehearing en banc, petition denial in this last appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.070" offset="10275610">It seems to us that Griffin is a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.297" offset="10288567">Griffin, as I'm sure you recall, involved a question of whether it was unconstitutional to make adverse comment on the failure to take a stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.128" offset="10331930">Now, it seems to us that there, the court said that a price was placed upon remaining silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.907" offset="10383026">The only way of course to remedy an adverse comment, as the court pointed out, is simply to take the stand because that's the only way you could avoid again those states in which the rule applied prior to Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.850" offset="10438823">Well, here it's quite plain that the petitioner did in fact testified at the second trial and -- so there's no question about adverse comment of that trial on his failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.965" offset="10483231">The question is simply whether his election to testify was voluntary or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.059" offset="10507577">The advice that was found in Griffin it seems to us was that there simply wasn't any way to avoid this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.462" offset="11821223">We think it's quite clear that a criminal defendant's decision, whether to take the stand or not, is always one that's under some strain and some stress and that only one of the risks that is taken is that the testimony might be used against him at retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.798" offset="11894575">It seems to us that if petitioner is correct in his basic contention, that is that a second trial testimony was compelled involuntary, then it's a little difficult to see as a logical matter why that sort of testimony could be used against him in any respect, not just on the question of guilt in a subsequent trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.490" offset="11985377">Now, I suppose petitioner would say, “Well, that's not right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2985.173" offset="12044100">And it's a different situation if I'm later prosecuted for perjury and the government tries to use this testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.971" offset="12135215">I would like in the remaining moments to mention just one more thing, first on the Fifth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.257" offset="12168443">It seems to us the petitioner really wants to have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.293" offset="12184534">He wants to be able to take the stand and he wants to try to convince the jury that they should acquit him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.357" offset="12220792">But if he fails on that but prevails on his objections to the introduction of these statements, he wants it to be assumed that he never took the stand and he never said anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.915" offset="12263006">He wants the slate totally wiped clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.319" offset="12276694">It seems to us that if the situation were analogous to Simmons, in other words, he couldn't assert a right to have these inadmissible statements excluded at trial and if he couldn't preserve that right for appellate review without taking the stand, then I think he should prevail under Simmons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.850" offset="13182725">First, we understand that he says two things basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.135" offset="13199862">One, this is just too long and you can't try me anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.468" offset="13225253">Well, it seems to me you have to look at the facts and the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.369" offset="13240822">The Court -- this Court has never held that through the exercise of legal rights through appellate review and obtaining reversals and other relief that the individual can't be tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.716" offset="13326190">In conclusion, I'd like to say that what petitioner really tries to do is to the Court of Appeals to second-guess the reasons why they had problems with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.349" offset="13360776">I think that as we point out if one thinks about and looks at the problems, it's a very complicated matter and the time was substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.991" offset="13391287">We don't deny that and I don't know why it took them so long, but it seems to me that it was not intolerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.497" offset="13425351">In short, we submit that the Court of Appeals would write on both Fifth and Sixth Amendment points and the judgment should be confirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.425" offset="13481044">I think that this is an even stronger case than the Simmons case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.872" offset="13494836">In that case, the court held that the testimony given in support of an unsuccessful motion to suppress could not be used against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.397" offset="13536946">Now, here the testimony was given to rebut admittedly inadmissible evidence illegally obtained, whereas there it was just given in an effort to show that it was inadmissible evidence, and an unsuccessful effort at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.835" offset="13598699">Now, it seems to me far wrong for the government 5617 and far worse for the government to be able to use the testimony in this case and for the government to be able to use the testimony in the Simmons case --</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.828" offset="13710712">It's certainly a distinction, but here there's a little tension between the Fifth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.561" offset="13737566">Now, the principal contention of the petitioners at the second trial was that these confessions were obtained in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.132" offset="13791901">They testified that they were obtained by threats and by abuse, and that the only point in which there was a conflict in the testimony between Eddie Harrison and the police office who investigated -- the police officer who testified to the contrary and obtained the confession, the testimony of the police officer turned out to be wrong and Eddie Harrison turned out to be telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.356" offset="13896808">Now, there's no use arguing that those aren't voluntary confessions anymore because the jury resolved that question against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.110" offset="13923767">But the point is that they were getting on the stand to say that to claim a Fifth Amendment right, to say that these were compelled confessions and they were false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.674" offset="13978102">And I don't think that this argument -- it sounds to me as if the government was saying, “Well look, these fellows were lucky to win in the Court of Appeals on that juvenile court blanc because that really wasn't much of a point.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.796" offset="14026585">But there was a clear violation of Escobedo there, too.</text>
