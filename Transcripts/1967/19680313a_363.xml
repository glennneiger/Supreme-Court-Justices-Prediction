            <text syncTime="53.277" offset="316479">We believe, yes, they did hold that that they we're saying that we lacked jurisdiction over a non-licensee CATV and we think subsequent cases, the Valley Vision Case particularly has borne that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.595" offset="369768">There was no question of an interim relief order in Valley Vision.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.253" offset="380426">They state our order and cited only the Southwestern Case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.039" offset="411564">The opinion is subject to construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.455" offset="425148">Although, we think that reading it – we read it a saying that we lacked jurisdiction over CATV when it relies upon Carroll to say that we cannot extend our orders to a non-licensee and that would not just be interim relief order because there would also be rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.970" offset="491290">And as I say in a subsequent case where there was no question of interim relief valley vision, the Court state our order and made clear in the all argument Judge Barnes was on the panel that they felt they had got to the jurisdictional issue and had held that we lacked jurisdiction over the off the air CATV.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="120.329" offset="584704">It was not brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.061" offset="587630">In the Buckeye Case, our jurisdictional position was fully sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.146" offset="611976">We believe that our jurisdiction stems directly from the explicit provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.033" offset="631515">Section 1 of the Act calls for the establishment of -- as efficient and nationwide system of wire and radio communication as possible and says that authority is being centralized in the FCC to achieve that.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.973" offset="691284">Section 2 (a) of the Act says that the provisions of this Act are applicable to all interstate communication by wire and radio and Sections 4 (i) and 303 give us broad rule making powers to carry out the provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.073" offset="747708">Now, CATV comes within the provisions because it is an interstate communication by wire within the definition in 3 (a) and 3 (e) and that is not really in dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.635" offset="793893">It also comes within the provisions that we think in another basis that it’s a -- it comes within the definition in 3 (b) of radio communication because it is an instrumentality incidental to the transmission of energy by radio and the definition includes that too, but it does come thus within two way.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.229" offset="864319">The provisions of the Act are applicable and we have made rules to carry out certain provisions and the provisions which we are carrying out, we say, are, 307 (b) which calls for this nationwide plan of local television, 303 (h) which is very important here and which says that the Commission can establish the service area stations so as to achieve that nationwide plan, and 303 (s) which is the all channel law which calls for the promotion of UHF, again, is to get this system of local television.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.742" offset="1002350">And what -- it is that the CATV is in effect extending the service area stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.526" offset="1029517">That is what it does and the heart of our position is that since the provisions of the Act are applicable to it, we can regulate that extension of the service area by CATV in order to prevent the frustration of this nationwide plan of local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.253" offset="1096391">Now, we argue that our action therefore comes explicitly within the terms of the Act, but it also we urge, comes within the spirit and the purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.570" offset="1137664">As this Court said in Pottsville, the very reason for the creation of the FCC was to keep a grip on this dynamic new technology that changes so much to prevent a chaotic allocation situation from resulting and in NBC, the Court said, we have been given comprehensive powers to achieve that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.727" offset="1258245">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.745" offset="1262320">There are two dissenters from our jurisdiction out of the seven Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.514" offset="1285413">We have sought clarifying legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.768" offset="1294399">We sought at the time we adopted the second report.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.699" offset="1310177">We believe that an important new field like this, it would be desirable to have Congress legislate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.096" offset="1335777">There has been no legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.596" offset="1341733">However, we argue that the recent legislative history, if anything, shows acquiescence when you examine this as we have pointed out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.171" offset="1384051">Now the Regents v. Carroll that was relied upon by the Court below, we are just inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.899" offset="1414980">In Regents, the Commission as a condition of renewing the license of a radio station specified that the station had to terminate a contract it had with an outside party that prevented the station we found from serving the public interest fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.346" offset="1480808">The station terminated the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.637" offset="1489899">There was a suit in the State Court for damages for Breach of Contract and this Court held that the Commission could not adjudicate the State Court matter, the issue of impossibility of performance because of the Commission’s action, all these were matters for the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.517" offset="1561475">The Court -- this Court did not come remotely close to holding in that case so that that the Commission lacked the authority to carry out the allocation provisions of the Act as to an entity coming expressly within those provisions, CATV, which is extending the service area or stations in a way that can frustrate the whole allocations plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.693" offset="1654157">The main argument that respondents have made against jurisdiction is that, the Act does not have any comprehensive scheme of regulation of wire communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.232" offset="1700342">It has some provisions they say like 605 but in the main, the Act deals in Title II with common carrier regulation, and in Title III with radio regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.461" offset="1745168">Well, we would agree that the Commission does not have plenary jurisdiction to do it, everything or anything it wants to CATV, but that does not mean we lacked jurisdiction entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.607" offset="1789785">What we have is the jurisdiction to carry out the pertinent provisions that do fit that are pertinent to CATV and that is what we are doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.867" offset="1834820">We would also agree that the Congress in 1934 no more thought of CATV than it thought of television.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.276" offset="1864495">They couldn’t foresee developments like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.184" offset="1872123">What they did was to give us a broad grand of authority under a public interest standard, to carry out the provisions of the Act is to all interstate communication by wire or radio.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.228" offset="6904247">Mr. Chief Justice and may it have please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.044" offset="6923577">At the very outset, I would like to address myself to the first question in this case, the assumption of jurisdiction by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.718" offset="6974255">This question comes up in connection with respondent CATV Systems which are off the air or none microwave fed and in that respect, certainly do not utilize the radio spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.202" offset="7032142">Now our attempt, our position on the lack of jurisdiction is a two-pronged basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.896" offset="7074983">The Commission asserts that its jurisdiction stems from Section 2 (a), its authority over interstate wire albeit by a non-common carrier, we submit on two basis that the Commission is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.490" offset="7169337">First, the Commission does not have jurisdiction over interstate communication by wire by non-common carriers except to the extent that such authority is conferred under the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.708" offset="7246242">Secondly, we urge that the Commission is lacking in jurisdiction because there are no standards, no criteria, no definition, no congressional guidance of any nature whatsoever with a respect to the basis of jurisdiction that's asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.277" offset="7320430">Let me address myself to each of these basis in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.304" offset="7332551">First, it is the fact that prior to the Commission's assertion of jurisdiction over CATV, it has never asserted jurisdiction over interstate communication by wire, by non-common carries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.612" offset="7401827">That statement is made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.547" offset="7409560">It is not controverted in the petitioner's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.081" offset="7431711">The only answer is and I believe I'm quoting “We did not probe that question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.826" offset="7462640">When I say that it has never done it, it has never done it despite the existence of thousands and thousands of miles of such interstate communication by wire non-common carriers, the typical example of the rights of Y Companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.779" offset="7534529">Now, I fully recognize rights the Y Companies words reasonable and feasible to utilize such a mode of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.100" offset="7571728">Now, this type of wire use obviously does differ from the use involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.116" offset="7599835">Namely that's the rights of Y Companies clearly had no so-called “impact”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.032" offset="7623450">They are not involved then television broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.961" offset="7643199">But I respectfully invite the Court's attention to those portions of our brief which detail at considerable length the legislative history with respect to the exclusion of the AP and UPI wire services from the purview of the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.971" offset="7735254">We put particular stress, although, we have termed the absolute and force grant analogy to the networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.186" offset="7772139">We say it's absolutely in distinguishable in ever single respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.814" offset="7794604">The networks use interstate wire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.718" offset="7810278">They use it on the transcontinental basis when respect to impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.780" offset="7830444">I think the Court may take the first jurisdictional notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.400" offset="7848939">In fact, the Commission itself has recognized to the networks the very life blood of television broadcasting and in the case of the networks, there has been an explicit disavow of direct authority over the networks.</text>

            <text syncTime="2279.220" offset="9220263">Wouldn't that -- wouldn't that leave the Commission in a bad situation if it could not protect New York's interest?</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.841" offset="9270732">I -- I do not view it in that fashion and second to the extent that the Commission is without power, I suggest the ready answer is, that such power maybe conferred by Congress and the Commission has sought such authority from Congress on several occasions and thus far without success, but I do think that there are number of very serious and very difficult legislative type determinations to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.092" offset="9399777">For example, is it appropriate that this type of new activity which has been exempted from the grant of jurisdiction to the Commission? Should this type of activity be regulated by a federal agency and if so should it be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.721" offset="9490265">We may all agree that the aviation for air transport industry is clearly the proper subject to regulation, but clearly should it be regulated by the ICC?</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.295" offset="9540524">Now, these are profound and difficult questions to answer, but they are questions of a legislative nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.999" offset="9583365">We have made a second basic attack on the jurisdiction asserted by the Commission, simply there no criteria or standards of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.034" offset="9635506">In answer to that contention, we get two curious replies in its reply brief and I submit for the first time the Commission, I'm sorry, the government asserts the criteria and standards that you think are required are spelled out in Title III and more particularly, the broadcast provisions of Title III.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.660" offset="9741981">And I think I'm quoting their brief when I say, they say, “These provisions are quiet explicit and CATV systems are subject to those explicit provisions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.850" offset="9798823">The other petitioner in its original brief suggest to this Court that the Federal Communications Commission under the statutory scheme at its option could have regulated CATV systems as common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.068" offset="9871653">So, we now have three claimed basis of jurisdiction; interstate wire or alternatively, if you don't like that one, the Government urges radio, broadcast provisions of radio and if you don't care for that one regulate them as common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.764" offset="9946467">And these arguments are submitted in answer to our contention that there are no criteria whatsoever governing the purported assertion of jurisdiction, but let as examine the Government's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.559" offset="9993592">I think, I submit, it is absolutely untenable to suggest to this Court that the broadcast provisions of Title III of the Communications Act are applicable and govern the regulation of CATV systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.441" offset="10061093">If so, in the case of broadcasting, it is the Commission which picks licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.455" offset="10097142">For the statuary limited term of 3 years and picks them based on specified statuary criteria including character, financial qualifications, technical qualifications and the frequencies are granted free in broadcasting and broadcasting is explicitly examined from the provisions of the common carrier sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.228" offset="10192332">In broadcasting by the decisions of this Court and the other Federal Courts, a State may not censor broadcast, a state may not impose a gross receipts tax on the operation broadcast stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.206" offset="10268191">Contrast that if you will with the whole scheme of the so-called regulatory regime as applied to CATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.291" offset="10312495">As I stated earlier, these licenses are granted pursuant to Commission invitation of solicitation by a host of local authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.606" offset="10357844">They are granted on a basis of local criteria for periods arranging up from three years to much, much greater periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.473" offset="10393266">In the case of the San Diego systems, we pay a gross receipts tax unlike broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.690" offset="10430151">To suggest to this Court that the specific provisions of broadcasting in Title III apply to the regulation of CATV and this is the definition of limitation that we say does not exist in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.340" offset="10500681">These propositions I respectfully submit is completely untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.789" offset="10522520">Let me give two specific examples if may, Under Section 326 of the Communications Act and this was not cited in our brief for the reason that the Government rely on the – relies on the explicit provisions of broadcasting was raise for the first time in its replied brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.549" offset="10613530">But under Section 326 it is provided, “No regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the Commission which I'll interfere with right of free speech by means radio communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.595" offset="11305775">First, under the Section 316 of the Act, the Commission would have to tell us what it proposed to do us?</text>

            <text syncTime="2815.843" offset="11366693">Third, it would have to give us notice, a 30-days notice for a hearing and in that hearing the Commission would have the burden of proceeding with the evidence and the burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.605" offset="13045844">There is built in to the utilization of spectrum space of necessity a judgment as to how the spectrum space should be use.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.488" offset="13525347">The Congress in that bill at least rather meticulously reviewed the appropriate provisions of the Communications Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.061" offset="13971623">The first has been covered very extensively with Mr. Scheiner, but I would like to briefly summarize our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.712" offset="13998268">We think the failure of jurisdiction is very basic simply because Title III is a licensing statute and that all rules and regulations promulgated their under must be connected with, in harmony with, and for the further of this licensing function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.248" offset="14072351">Of course, there are specific statutory exceptions that Congress has made like 303 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.067" offset="14095653">We think this interpretation is consistent with statements of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.269" offset="14116446">Starting in 1940 in Pottsville, in Sanders 1943 and NBC, and of course in 1950 in the Carol case, this Court has described Title III as a licensing section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.203" offset="14176214">Now, the Commission the Government has also contended that they have the right to regulate FCC -- the CATV under the definition of radio transmissions and they concede of course in Title III is as limited to radio or radio transmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.525" offset="14241520">And Mr. Geller referred to the definition contained in 2 (b) and 2 (d) of the Communications Act which provides that radio transmissions cover any service or communication that is incidental thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.137" offset="14299930">And Mr. Scheiner has pointed out that under this interpretation they claim jurisdiction to regulate CN ---- the CATV under Title III.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.264" offset="14336397">We think the answer to this argument is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.244" offset="14356355">If they are radio transmissions, the present rules and regulations are invalid since they do not comply with the specific congressional directives contained in Title III.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.935" offset="14403062">For example they do not proceed in written applications, they don't give instructions permits, they don't grant licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.736" offset="14434304">They don't determine the qualifications of the operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.317" offset="14448619">Equally important as Mr. Scheiner pointed out they don't give the CATV operator the protections provided in Title III for station licensees and again, he referred to Section 316 and 326.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.504" offset="14505357">And the freedom from censorship, I think could not be more clearly violated than the order in this case which prohibits Mission Cable from bringing in the signals of Los Angeles to the San Diego Area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.057" offset="14555617">But I didn't understand Mr. Geller's argument quite that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.486" offset="14573275">Perhaps I'm wrong, but I thought he was arguing sort of a necessary and appropriate power that is to say that implicit in the other parts of the Act in various parts of the Act, he asks this Court to find a power to the Commission to impose certain types of regulation on CATV as necessary and incidental to the explicit powers in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3741.942" offset="15071169">That as I understand their argument, the words incidental to radio transmission means they are the same as radio transmission and therefore, they are under Title III.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.124" offset="15115891">The other side of the coin, may it please the Court, is if they are not radio transmissions then Title III clearly gives them no authority to regulate because by their own admission is limited to radio transmissions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3867.706" offset="15574183">And for the separates of which I like to direct the Court's attention to now is that they call it CATV rules by the Commission's own admission in the second report in order by a decision of the Court of Appeals in the Buckeye case are designed solely for the elimination of competition to CATV to the UHF stations primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.284" offset="15652551">And to limit the ability of American citizens to watch signals that are freely available to them and do not cause any electrical interference to any existing station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.510" offset="15693406">Now as I understood the Commission before did not claim any explicit authority Mr. Geller said, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.453" offset="15717230">I understood they were claiming their authority under an applied interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.971" offset="15739277">Then, they had a little formula that it went like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.746" offset="15750353">They said take 2 (a) which is a definition the Commission has control of all interstate communications by wire and add to that the rule making provisions of 303 (f), 4 (i), and 303 (r) and apply that to the substantive provisions, 307 (b) and 303 (h) and you come up with jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.502" offset="15837393">Now, one factor in this equation that they don't particularly emphasize is that the rule making functions provide that these rules and regulations promulgated there under must be consistent with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.990" offset="15887339">And I also suggest to the Court that under in these implied powers the purposes of these rules and regulations must be consistent with the condition -- congressional directive for purposes of enacting the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.048" offset="15935613">Now, this Court had occasion on numbers cases to point out, why Congress enacted the Communications Act and the Radio Act of 1927, its predecessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.102" offset="15971767">They were concern according to this Court, that the chaos that occurred in the radio that stations and people by jumping stations from frequency to frequency, from community to community were destroying all service to the American people so that in effect their was no radio service and therefore, it was necessary come up with a Licensing Act to control these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.246" offset="16056404">This Court has also stated that the second purpose was that Congress was spurred by the fear monopoly and they were concerned that some industries might gable up all the large frequencies and place them in a large metropolitan areas and this deprived other portions of the United States of the services and as many services as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.372" offset="16136861">These two reasons clearly point out that Congress was interested in dividing up this electronic pie if you will in as many ways as possible consistent with the physical laws of electronic to make as many services as available to many people as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.934" offset="16199137">Now under these interpretations consistent with these interpretations, this Court for instance has held that licensing per se is not a violation of freedom of speech because if we don't have licenses, we will destroy everything and therefore it's not an unreasonable interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.791" offset="16258487">This Court has held in the NBC case that Congress had -- the Commission has the power to regulate the network relations, the contracts with these -- which affiliated stations in order to provide better and more services and this was incidental to their licensing functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.183" offset="16328077">And in United States v. Storer this Court has held that the Commission could set up multiple ownership rules as incident to its licensing power such it would be useless to make a Commission on an application to which they have predetermined was already contrary to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.205" offset="16392234">Well, the Commission is -- the Government in its brief has argued again and again until Congress has bestowed comprehensive powers upon this Commission and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.353" offset="16436746">But this Court had said these powers are not limitless and they must be interpreted in line with the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.917" offset="16463078">Now with this in mind, I would like to turn to the two specific provisions that the Commission claims gives it the power to regulate CATV and this is 303 (h) and 307 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.131" offset="16515845">Now, 303 (h) provides as a directive to the Commission to set up areas and zones of service for stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.304" offset="16544580">I'm sure this Court is aware at the time the Communications Act was enacted, Congress was thinking primarily of the standard broadcast band, that is the band between 540 and 1600 GHz.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.140" offset="16591914">And they were concerned, that the interference that was being caused and Congress was fully aware that the factors that cause interference are the same factors that cause service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.901" offset="16643009">Instead of broadcast station it is power and frequency which results in a usable service to a certain period of area and then far beyond that, is a creation of electrical interference that destroys other service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.569" offset="16693687">And this was a directive to the Commission to set up different types of stations with different coverages and different power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.575" offset="16721690">So again, they could get as many possible services to all the people of the United States within the capabilities of the physical laws of electronics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.185" offset="16760142">Now, 307 (b) as the Court is aware provides that in handling applications the Commission should make a fair and efficient distribution of services and facilities throughout the communities and states insofar as there is a demand for the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.453" offset="16829210">I suggest this again with a clear indication that the Congress intent to make as many services available to all the people of the United States as would be possible within the physical laws of electronics and not allow them all to get in one place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.425" offset="16897024">Now consistent with these two congressional directives, Congress has come up with this -- the Commission has come up with the series of rules and regulations to cover standard broadcasting and television.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.440" offset="16941119">In standard broadcasting, they have created classes of stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.693" offset="16954180">There's a local station which has power up to 1 kilowatt or a thousand watts, 250 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.767" offset="16978422">They have created the regional stations with powers up to five kilowatts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.207" offset="16992214">Clear channel stations of power of the 50 kilowatts, they have day time stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.294" offset="17012590">The Commission has recognized that in order to get this maximum service, they should limit the area service but what they are really doing, may it please the Court, is not limiting the area of service, they are limiting the interference implications which go far beyond that area service and which there is no practical way to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.802" offset="17090539">And Congress' directive to create different areas and zones was again a clear directive to make as many services available to the people of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.558" offset="17133589">Now in television, it's still I might point out is in the sample that in United States we have a few frequencies with one's AM station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.344" offset="17172773">If all frequencies have one AM station, we'd have 106 stations, but with this ability to create different classes of stations, we have today over 4,200 AM stations operating in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.281" offset="17224495">Now, the television and commission did the same thing, using a slightly different plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.055" offset="17239542">They set up the television allocation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.778" offset="17254484">They provided from minimum separation distances between co-channel and adjacent channel stations and this was to prevent interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.689" offset="17294085">And then based upon this minimum separation distances, they allocated television frequencies to all the communities in the United States as many as possible while it could still avoid interference based upon these minimum separations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.042" offset="17359496">And then they limited the tower height and the power which were two of the factors that cause both service and interference in television.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.607" offset="17397844">So that as many as possible, again, as many stations as possible could exist within this electronic spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.421" offset="17429086">Now, the Commission has set up classes of television service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.519" offset="17441416">There are city grade, grade A and grade B.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.517" offset="17457403">Now I'm sure the Court is aware this grade B is nothing more than imaginary or fictional line it's drawn on the chart which is an engineer's attempt to show that at that spot, a certain grade of service, a certain strength of signal exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.342" offset="17516753">But the Commission has never contended that service stops at that Grade B contour.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.163" offset="17535979">Service goes far beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.488" offset="17541308">It may be a factor of terrain, a sensitivity of the receiver, the height of the antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.449" offset="17565132">In San Diego, we have a force of their antennas which are listening off the air to this Los Angeles stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.079" offset="17595643">The Commission has never said that every station in the same community must have the same Grade B contours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.197" offset="17624168">Within the limits of the maximum minimum power, they can have any height than any tower they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.199" offset="17644126">So in the same city, you will have stations with different Grade B contours, different service areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.149" offset="17671920">But in every case they are limited by the Commission's rules to preventing interference, to causing interference, beyond those Grade B -- beyond the interference which is well beyond the Grade B contour.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.577" offset="17733674">I submit that the purpose of Congress in enacting these two Sections was very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.547" offset="17761573">It was to provide the max -- that the Commission should create the maximum number of services possible within the physical laws of electronics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.035" offset="17799502">Now, Mr. Geller stated at the opening that the congressional -- Congress had given the Commission a mandate to have local service and he referred to 307 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.229" offset="17848299">Now, if he was saying that Congress gave the Commission a mandate to provide for frequencies in every community so that they would be available if they were needed, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.887" offset="17890931">I submit for the FCC has gone wrong in the CAT regulations as they have attempted to go into a new field of economy – of the economics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.956" offset="17927189">They have attempted to limit competition in an attempt to guarantee the viability of UHF stations whether the people want to see them or not and I submit that purpose is directly contrary to the congressional purpose in setting up Sections 307 (b) and 303 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.667" offset="18006079">Now Justice Fortas, I think you ask Mr. Geller a question the other day as to whether or not CATV would cause -- would create competition to the network stations?</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.681" offset="18038053">And I think Mr. Geller misunderstood your answer -- your question because the answer no because the duplication rules would prevent competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.812" offset="18070653">I assume your question was directed to point would unregulated CATV cause competition to networks and the answer in emphatically, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.802" offset="18098552">They would be the prime source of competition and the federal government, the district -- Department of Justice in its brief in a District – United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the ITT case, specifically propose the merger on the grounds that ITT was going into the CATV business and this would be greatest possible source of competition to the networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.739" offset="18194369">Now, we have also asked this Court to reconsider and clarify its language in the Sander's case which we think is an eminently sound decision, since it holds that broadcasting is free.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.313" offset="18240658">It is a freely competitive business and that the Commission has no control over the business of broadcasting and that the broadcaster must stay on the fall upon the acceptability of his product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.680" offset="18298128">Unfortunately, there is some other language in the case that Commission in licensing stations must consider impact of competition on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.718" offset="18334281">And as the result of that language as the United States Court of Appeals for District Columbia Circuit on the Caroll case has come up with the Rule of the Commission must consider the protest or the petitioner of an existing station, if it objects to a new license being granted in the same community that alleges that the competition will hurt the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.552" offset="18421530">Now, there have been a lot of cases started to that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.440" offset="18433128">There been a lot of hearings, but I know of no instance from the Federal Communications Commission has denied a license with the finding that the competition from other station will be detrimental to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.563" offset="18493628">Now, the Commission is aware and I'm sure this Court can take judicial notice that time after time stations and communities are not financially successful and they go through one owner and two-owner, and three owners until finally somebody gets hold of that station and for some reason, either initiative hard work knowledge of local conditions he makes it successful and it starts producing a product that the people want to watch and then it starts contributing to the welfare of that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.742" offset="18630301">Now broadcasting is something unique, it is something that's based upon an initiative, all other forms of information, entertainment, education, or in competition and we submit Congress wisely left the broadcasting business to be in competition and broadcast station should rely upon their product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.744" offset="18702399">And we submit that here, where non-micro way CATV does in no way causes electrical interference to existing stations, in no way prevents the development of local stations, if there is a demand from the citizens for that station, in no way prevents any person from watching, if he's desire friends to see -- when the CATV comes in upon his request, he can have a switch put in and still contain -- maintain his outside antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.769" offset="18830399">It's strictly within his control what he wants to watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.326" offset="18844714">I submit that the purpose of the CATV Rules are diametrically opposed to the intend of Congress and that enacting both the Act in these two specific Sections which the Commission is relying upon and for that reason it's beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="4808.072" offset="19335711">The ones in San Diego have 12 channels and they use some of those channels or can use some of those channels to other things other than bringing in television.</text>

            <text syncTime="4845.852" offset="19486804">Well, they asked first in 196o when Congress -- when Commission didn't ask for it in a very hard way and in the second time, they ask for it and as I'm not familiar with the hearings and what extent it was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.304" offset="19532570">But I do know there was a very strenuous minority report which we quote in our brief which specifically points out, why the Commission should not have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.226" offset="19568306">And raises the very problems the complications will arise unless Congress fully considers them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.017" offset="19595473">Now, Mr. Chief Justice you raised the question as what was the answer to the reasonableness problem that Mr. Geller raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.896" offset="19626924">Now the force of course is, we've emphasized that there is no electrical interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.424" offset="19649076">The point is that its only economic impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.487" offset="19665272">I suggest that Mr. Geller may have a very reasonable argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.269" offset="19680423">There maybe a need for economic control against to ensure the viability of VHF and UHF television.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.513" offset="19717413">They're may be a need to limit the right of American public to watch television channels that are freely available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.124" offset="19747819">There may be even a need to give this power to the Federal Communications Commission and administrative agency but I suggest that is a matter for Congress and Mr. Geller's argument is directed to the wrong forum since a federal agency should not be allowed to take itself up by its foot straps and launch itself into a new field, find you the control of economics, competition without specific congressional direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.906" offset="19855026">Now with time remaining to I would like to adjust myself for the decision of the Court below in which it said this Commission didn't have the power to which you would stay ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.963" offset="19895254">We think the decision is eminently sound and that the Court made have very fine analysis of the powers to Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.037" offset="19923571">And they very briefly pointed out that under the rule making Sections 4 (i), 303 (f), and 303 (r) which says that, the powers must be consistent with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.980" offset="19975293">That if they had the tremendous power, if the Commission has the tremendous power to issue a stay without a hearing and upon disputes of fact because there is a lot of disputes of fact in this petition in which they acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.513" offset="20029419">They had asked the Congress to do a useless thing in enacting 312 (b) because they clearly have the authority to do everything that 312 (b) gave them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.662" offset="20070066">They also asked the Commission -- Congress to do I useless thing when it given the parts to find its forfeitures because I submit, that would clearly be encompassed in this broad authority they now claiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.787" offset="20114474">It is also equal important that when Congress did decide to give them some additional power cease and desist, after they claim, they had no right except the power to revoke licenses, the Congress very carefully hedged that power in with limitations to protect the rights of the licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.070" offset="20195662">What we have here is a case where the federal agency claims that under the implied power it's taking out of specifics, it has greater power than it has under the specific authority granted to it by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.138" offset="20263894">And Mr. Geller has pointed out in his oral argument and he is also pointed in his brief that the Commission could have proceeded by a general order in this rule making.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.137" offset="20307884">They could have come up with an order saying that all CATV stops here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.740" offset="20338291">Now, they cite no authority for this and we don't concede they would have this authority even though, we go under the premise they have something have jurisdictional with CATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.486" offset="20381341">Specifically, they would not have the authority by a rule making to issue a general order saying that all VHF televisions have to go off the air at 8 o'clock in order to give UHF economic protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.070" offset="20435675">The Section 316 would prohibit that because of the modification and license and then entitled adjudicatory hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.526" offset="20469426">But we really think the argument is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.716" offset="20486248">The Commission elected to follow another procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.249" offset="20500355">They didn't go by the state order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.778" offset="20506520">They didn't attempt by a stay order to control the lawful operations of the CATV systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.649" offset="20529925">They elected to go on the ad hoc basis and use a stay authority and an interlocutory type of authority and we submit they clearly do not have that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.068" offset="20571617">And the Syracuse case that he refers to which upholds the authority of agency that either go by general rule making or specific case, as I read it says, our goals on the assumption that is clear that the agency has both those powers and the case says it's in our discretion to go one way to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.754" offset="20642356">Here the key is and we dispute that they have the authority to go on the second method and if they lacked the power to issue a temporally injunction to stop the lawful activities upon pleadings which are completely in dispute as to fact, we submit, they do not have authority to issue a temporally stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.491" offset="20729292">For that basis we feel to the decision of the lower court was eminently sound, it is correct, and should be affirm by this Court.</text>
