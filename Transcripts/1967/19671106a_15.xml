            <text syncTime="143.987" offset="679372">Now, in a short time ago in 1966, these owners were advised and informed by judicial fiat that the physical characteristics of their waterfront property had been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.309" offset="768606">Likewise, the theory of the law under which this land was purchased by the Government has been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.678" offset="810088">Now, the theory of the law of accretion antedates the commonly law, probably enter dates of the Justinian Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.932" offset="851048">It is -- it has been the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.089" offset="875708">We complain bitterly, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington changed this law 75 years after the fact and hundred years after the time of acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.979" offset="939238">Now, at the time of acquisition at until statehood in 1889, counsel freely admits that this law, this theory bound the United States as grantor and us as grantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.575" offset="1017710">Our line were clearly established by a judicial precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.163" offset="1044041">Our western or seaward boundary line is the line of being high tide and that is established by the only known and a certain method that's been advanced to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.105" offset="1095764">That is the theory or the formula of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.637" offset="1121886">Now, to us, it is not a belated action.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.835" offset="1166712">It is an action grounded without precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.475" offset="1181236">Certainly, the counsel freely admit also that there is no federal case in any federal court lending support to this theory of the Hughes case even by inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.001" offset="1259395">In our opinion, there is no case previous to Hughes in the State of Washington that lends any support or credence to the theory of the Hughes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.519" offset="1305475">The Hughes case says not now but in 1889, we took your property.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.183" offset="1336090">The property is no longer bounded by an ambulatory boundary line as fixed by the natural movements of the tide of the Pacific Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.916" offset="1383006">This is fixed and immovable as of 1889 because we say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.115" offset="1403800">Now the formula that we have it up is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.125" offset="1431907">It is the line of ordinary high tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.892" offset="1442983">Now, the Honorable Justice Weaver, the writer of the majority opinion in Spencer a page and a half of defining this line of ordinary high tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.099" offset="1479764">I submit Your Honor, his definition follows no judicial precedent and is based upon no scientific or no formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.952" offset="1523231">This is his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.463" offset="1533262">There is no engineer can lay out a line based upon that formula nor any lawyers advise his plan under this judicial formula where that line will lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.810" offset="1606614">The Honorable Justice equates this line with the line of vegetation.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.218" offset="1628244">The line of vegetation has never been known in the history of the world to be equated with the line of being high tide on titled boundaries where the reason is natural.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.474" offset="1681220">The reason is common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.671" offset="1690102">Your winter Europe, high tides, your storm tides wash away any vegetation that is apparent and consistent on lakes for example, none tidal water boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.137" offset="1803891">The purpose of the line of vegetation, Your Honor, it is unchangeable and fairly accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.721" offset="1838268">It remained so in all water boundaries of inland lakes or rivers that are unaffected by the tidal flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.928" offset="1879124">The tidal flow is so vast that this accretion or this vegetation land simply will not remain static.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.775" offset="1918516">Now, this is a scientific truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.650" offset="1933981">This is an actual, visual matter of observation on these ocean beaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.921" offset="1971075">In one tide, it will wash away miles of that sort of vegetation to the depth of several hundred feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.465" offset="2009213">The vegetation was there the day before it has not existed today, therefore it becomes inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.219" offset="2032201">It is not used.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.408" offset="2045053">Now, I do not propose to argue our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.409" offset="2080998">I shall simply try to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.966" offset="2099284">We bought to the United States Government the deed ran to the Pacific Ocean and to our areas it assigns forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.900" offset="2138990">We understood in any layman, any patent deed well understood, he was buying property bounded by the Pacific Ocean and not subject to an intervening title on upland subject to sale, lease, commercial use by some agency of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.807" offset="2270647">We believe we can rely with confidence on the wisdom of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.118" offset="2315891">We believe that it will follow its own precedent particularly the Borax case and particularly this case refusal to review the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Ninth Circuit, United States versus Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.996" offset="2639391">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.522" offset="2649422">The United States is in this case by invitation of this Court at the time of the filing the petition for writ of certiorari when our views were asked to be submitted to the Court on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.437" offset="2697070">Our examination of this case and the issue presented shows a very substantial federal interest in its outcome which I would like to elucidate for you for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.101" offset="2743777">First of all and most important, the Federal Government is perhaps the largest grantor of lands on the Pacific Coast as this Court well knows his republic land states and much of the land indeed the substantial part of it was at one time in federal ownership prior to statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.983" offset="2819323">Therefore, the integrity and the interpretation of federal patents of land is here in question and has been placed in substantial question by the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.353" offset="2864776">Secondly, the Federal Government is the owner at the present time of considerable waterfront coastal property, literal property in the State of Washington some 200 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.044" offset="2927574">Most important of all in this connection is that we hold much of this land and trust for Indian tribes and under the policies of the Federal Government as they now exist to a lot lands to Indians over the years and make them the actual fee owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.010" offset="2995388">The fact that a right that we maintain they have to future accretions is taken away by this case or will be when the allotment is made constitutes an important federal problem with the Federal Government here as trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.399" offset="3052962">In addition, acquisitions of land for private purposes from private citizens are contemplated if the rule of the court below obtains the Federal Government will not be able to get these future accretions without purchasing them or condemning them for the state for what I am sure is a not inconsiderable sum of money in view of the historic nature of this coast line which seems to be characterize by daily imperceptible accretions building up over many years to quite sizeable amounts of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.420" offset="3209070">The law, I submit, is quite clear as to whether these accretions, the right thereto can be taken away by state action when they derive from a federal patent or other form of grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.619" offset="3273853">This Court has taken up this issue in its various forms on many occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.052" offset="3299558">First, let me say that this Court has considered the question of whether a right to a future accretion is a vested right, one that continues and cannot be taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.831" offset="3342712">In an ancient case, the County of St. Clair cited in our brief that this decision has made a right to future accretions of the imperceptible kind is deemed to be an inherent right of the ownership of property as to what law obtains this Court in the Borax case cited many times in all briefs before you has decided quite clearly that when a federal grant is being interpreted whether or not the Federal Government remains the owner of any of the land in question, the measuring line as between tidal waters and upland waters is determined by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.708" offset="3506239">And in Borax, that measuring line was held to be the line of being high tide determined in accordance with proper geological measurement which is I submit quite capable of being ascertain under current practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.920" offset="3571022">I add parenthetically that Borax need not be the rule forever if more accurate scientific measurement are being developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.554" offset="3613550">I'm sure that Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in that case simply selected this rule because it was the best scientific one then available.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.632" offset="3657853">Borax simply fixed that line as between an upland owner and the state as owner of tide lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.368" offset="3680841">It wasn't on an accretion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.591" offset="3689723">However, I can see no distinction between accretions and the mere fixing of the line between the upland owner and the state as the owner of the tide lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.772" offset="3734444">The consequences to each party in both Borax and an accretion case are large and a considerable body of land would have gone to the upland owner under his contention in Borax had the line not been fixed where it was in accordance with federal principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.822" offset="3810617">I think one of the important arguments that the state makes contrary to our rule is that these accretions lie in the future and that many things can intervene so that these accretions will never occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.115" offset="3871848">They're trying to equate the petitioner Mrs. Hughes with an ordinary riparian owner and they are talking about riparian rights and I think it is most important in making the legal distinction in deciding this case to realize that accretion is not a riparian right for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.294" offset="3952515">The riparian right is a right in an owner bordering on stream, bordering on a body of navigable water to make some use of that water of his location as against other private owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.755" offset="4014373">He can build here, work out so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.838" offset="4026702">He has a right to use water from the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.810" offset="4042585">He has the right to use it for navigational purposes but this right, it has long been held, always been held in common law countries, this right can be taken away when the sovereign can demonstrate some overriding public need for these waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.889" offset="4114892">It is as Mr. Justice Holmes said, a permissive right he said that in a case called Stevens against Arnold cited in our brief and he makes this very important distinction which is now very important in the Hughes case, in Stevens against Arnold for it distinguishes these riparian rights of which I have spoken as permissive rights as opposed to right to accretion which is indicia of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.498" offset="4233383">Another point strongly favoring the Federal Government's position here and the application of federal law to the accretions is the fact that this is a federal patent, a federal instrument and it's long been held by this Court that in respect to federal instruments, federal law applies as cited in that law review article, Professor Corker has cited again in all of our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.799" offset="4342575">He realizes that there is certainly a clear field of trust aspect to a federal patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.040" offset="4719574">Here, however, they are simply saying we're redefining a boundary which in the federal deed was expressed as the Pacific Ocean which federal law has interpreted to mean high tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.137" offset="4763878">That line is simply moved and in accordance with the very ancient principles that everywhere else in the United States except Washington continues to obtain, they are saying that they can cut it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.332" offset="4816750">This, I submit, they cannot do and one of their justifications for cutting off or attempting to cut off this right is they say that the state have tide lands and that because of accretions, these tide lands have been taken away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.010" offset="4875368">This has deprived the state of their equal footing with other states to own their own tide lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.632" offset="4917896">The state has lost no tide lands whatsoever as a result of these accretions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.928" offset="4943078">Tide lands are the line between mean high tide and low tide as they exist at any given moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.711" offset="4974216">Picture if you will a moveable -- a belt consisting of the tide lands as accretion comes to the shore, this belt simply moves seaward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.777" offset="5022490">Low tide doesn't stay where it is just because the land on the land where we cited accreted, low tide is probably just as far from the high tide line as it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.023" offset="5063450">This belt has simply moved out to sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.995" offset="5075362">And I submit that the accretions may have resulted in the state making very substantial and important gains to its title because as that line of low water moved seaward as a result of the accretions, the three-mile limit of that state as defined in the Submerge Lands Act moves that further out to sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.203" offset="5160208">In accordance with what we all know of the developing exploration for and discovery of the valuable minerals in this three-mile belt of territorial sea of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.131" offset="5211930">These accretions may result in the state gaining until it reaches for itself as a result thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.267" offset="5240456">The State by this case in Hughes is merely asking to obtain more at both ends on the seaward and the landward side of its tide lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.117" offset="5279848">This is not something contemplated by Pollard against Hagen which simply confirmed to the states their tide lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.719" offset="6478242">Then from the Columbia River north, we have a long sliver, a long piece of land which runs almost directly north called the Long Beach Peninsula and it's separated from the mainland via Bay, Willapa Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.915" offset="6555042">Then you proceed north to another stretch of ocean beach until you come to Grays Harbor which is another inlet and then the beach continues north until the Straits of Juan de Fuca.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.491" offset="6605302">Now the strait is the entrance to the Great Puget Sound and Hood Canal, the large and internal waterway of the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="3149.415" offset="12701027">In 1901, this beach was dedicated to the public and we've illustrated the area that the public had their rights in up to the top of the beach and administratively it was construed that this beach included that a 175 feet of accretion, that portion there, our Supreme Court leaves us in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.752" offset="12794337">The legislature after the decision of the Court then comes in and speaks unmistakably, we gave a seashore conservation area which extends from extreme low tides or else we can get up to the vegetation line and that is a public beach now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.422" offset="12873017">The accretion between the public deeds is held for the benefit of the seashore conservation area access and other things that can be used in connection with the beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.964" offset="12943235">Now, when we talk -- the question about changing the common law doctrine of accretion, now that question has been before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a case construing a California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.231" offset="13024319">The California statute was subsequently reinterpreted by the California court in a different way than the Court of Appeals had it interpreted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.232" offset="13060263">But nonetheless, the Western Pacific case, Western Pacific Railroad versus Southern Pacific Company is the California case which delves into the problem and justifies the state's power to change accretion if for instance you have a sloping beach and the state fills along the top of the beach disregarding the accretion problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.375" offset="13180844">But if our -- yes, if the state builds across the top of the beach, that fixes the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.374" offset="13208848">The state can do any number of things, it could put those bulkheads which would cause the beach to build up and this would fix the property line and all we're doing here is accomplishing the same thing by a law rather than sending a man out that would pick and shovel to pick the dirt up to fix the line, you do it by law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4889.980" offset="19663287">A few pause in rebuttal, first, Justice Douglas asked the question if there is any land in this vicinity, ocean frontage that was eroding just north of this property in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.061" offset="19743640">There has been nearly five miles of it erode and the erosion had been nearly a quarter, I mean a mile and a quarter in depth as Justice Hill said in the dissenting opinion, the State of Washington and the public must swim out a mile and a quarter, dive down to about 45 meters in order to enjoy their tideland under the Hughes opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.430" offset="19877073">Now, counsel has mentioned that the State of Washington since 1929 has sold 90% of the water frontage in Grays Harbor County, the adjoining county to the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.936" offset="19971114">All of the state deeds containing an ambulatory boundary line stating, first to call second class tidelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.326" offset="20004655">Such an appellation doesn't exist either in law or fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.834" offset="20038719">There's no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.001" offset="20043421">They are uplands but the deed reached to the line of ordinary high tide as the same now or hereafter may exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.740" offset="20090337">After this property has all been solved about 30 miles of it, the states run out on erosion frontage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.189" offset="20132133">The Supreme Court has generated more in the Hughes case for the state to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.361" offset="20160867">Now, the counsel has said that the Hughes decision is not startling, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.233" offset="20204335">To us it's incredible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.591" offset="20213739">As a result of this decision, we have five rules concerning water boundaries in the State of Washington, one concerning navigable rivers and streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.003" offset="20275388">This is an ambulatory boundary following the common law concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.172" offset="20304018">Next is the ocean and probably bay frontage water bounded which under the Hughes case adopts a new completely changed theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.285" offset="20372564">Then we have a no man's land.</text>

            <text syncTime="5085.191" offset="20444139">Then we have another boundary line concept if the present owner is the United States Government.</text>
