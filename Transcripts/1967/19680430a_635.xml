            <text syncTime="52.806" offset="314598">The next day, he was subpoenaed before the grand jury of New York County and asked to sign a waiver of immunity from prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.081" offset="355662">It was announced at that hearing that it was a criminal investigation into conspiracy to violate gambling laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.835" offset="394742">The appellant refused to sign such a waiver on advice of counsel stating that since he was a target of the investigation, the grand jury had no authority to subpoena and question him.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.439" offset="461093">He was not questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.520" offset="473422">He was not granted immunity but rather excused and thereupon was served with an additional departmental charge, refusal to sign a waiver of immunity before the grand jury as required by Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution and Section 1123 of the New York City Charter.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.033" offset="771532">There is a more formal procedure under 244 -- 2447 at the Code of Criminal Procedure which was not followed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.050" offset="811551">But it is my position that he would have been granted immunity had he testified under the compelled compulsion of the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.797" offset="842585">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.558" offset="853556">Now the appellant was served with an additional charge, refusal to sign a waiver of immunity by the police commissioner and directed to report for a hearing on that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.044" offset="903502">Upon appearing, the appellant requested that all three charges; the substantive charges as well as the procedural charge of refusal to sign a waiver be tried at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.395" offset="948955">This request was denied and the hearing proceeded under objection on the one charge of refusal to sign a waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.099" offset="983751">And the grand jury minutes and the District Attorney testified at that hearing and resulted in the dismissal complained of in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.868" offset="1034846">No disposition of the substantive charges of misconduct was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.652" offset="1065984">It is the appellant's contention that the requirement to sign a waiver of immunity before the grand jury imposed by state law is an unconstitutional limitation on the federal constitutional provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and therefore must fall under the federal supremacy of laws section.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.689" offset="1158144">I think it's very important to keep in mind that he was under substantive charges involving the same area of grand jury inquiry at the time he was asked to sign a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.316" offset="1200671">He was not someone against to whom charges were not then and there pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.629" offset="1225853">Appeals through the Courts to this Court subsequently followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.647" offset="1245915">The Court of Appeals of the State of New York said that the Garrity case undoubtedly partially invalidated these sections, these sections of law requiring the waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.419" offset="1329089">A portion of the subpoena would be inadmissible but absolute immunity I don't think would apply unless the formal procedures under the New York Penal Law were followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.312" offset="1376632">And there was a definite intention on the part of the grand jury to confer that immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.861" offset="1406830">There was no legal residuum here respecting the substantive acts of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.747" offset="1434311">No finding whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.375" offset="1440893">The only act of misconduct here was an invocation of a federally protected right against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.762" offset="1494392">Under Malloy against Hogan, the protection of Fourteenth Amendment is coextensive with that of the Fifth and it applies to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.762" offset="1526471">The Court of Appeals of the State in New York in this case has held that a refusal to sign a waiver of immunity is equivalent to and an act of invoking a privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.685" offset="1586134">And that being the highest court in the state, I think that their interpretation of the statute is binding for all purposes in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.183" offset="1920084">Your Honor, it was a construction of a New York State constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.696" offset="1946206">Article I, Section 6 required the appellant according to the Court of Appeals to waive his immunity -- waive his privilege against self-incrimination and testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.842" offset="1990719">That is directly from the opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.314" offset="2016632">Now the New York State constitutional proviso, accepting public officers from its own protection contained against self-incrimination under Article I, Section 6 at the same time seeks to add a proviso to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and a proviso to the Fourteenth Amendment when no such proviso exists in the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.581" offset="2109733">Therefore, it is the appellant's position that the statute is unconstitutional that the requirements are unconstitutional for continued public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.222" offset="2176293">Now, the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment have applied not only to criminal sanctions but also to administrative sanctions citing for example (Inaudible) case, Lovett, and a few other cases in my brief so that we have a situation where there is a penalty visited upon this appellant strictly by virtue of his invocation of a federally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.546" offset="2289560">The right -- the invocation of that right has proved costly and it is a federally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.555" offset="2325608">The action of the State in New York in requiring its public officers to waive a federally protective requirement is not, I believe, a constitutional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.044" offset="2383600">Now this -- Court of Appeals of the State of New York has said that Garrity undoubtedly partially invalidated Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution but they don't say what part of that is invalid nor is there any saving clause that I could find in the New York State Constitution saying that a part of a Section is declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.546" offset="2477537">The rest survives.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.241" offset="2484328">At any rate, the Court of Appeals has said that the question when Gardner was before the grand jury and all the way up to the time of the Court of Appeals decided its case and including today, they have said that this is an open question that this Court has left the question open.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.231" offset="2564263">Yet, they have countenance by their affirmation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.854" offset="5266787">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.861" offset="5294791">This is a case that is of great importance to all municipal governments, state governments and federal governments, federal government in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.183" offset="5352155">The problem is whether or not a person occupying official position, one of the most important of which is a policeman in any city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.366" offset="5412864">Law enforcing officer can be asked in regard to the performance of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.371" offset="5456854">Mr. Justice Black -- Stewart brought out properly the issue in this case which did not involve the questioning in regard to the performance of those duties because the appellant refused to sign any waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.630" offset="5537938">But he gave as his reason even more than that in that he said that, “Under the law, it was not legal for him to be subpoenaed before a grand jury where he was a target of the investigation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.023" offset="5623515">So that he made it plain that he would not answer any questions regardless because he said, "He could not legally be brought before the jury".</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.306" offset="5664580">Now, he was in error in regard to the law in so asserting although he did it under the advice of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.315" offset="5708675">The law as set out by the Court of Appeals of New York in Tomasello, and Goldman, also in Stude make it plain that there is a right and legal power to subpoena him before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.361" offset="5804805">But there are certain instance under the Constitution of New York that result from that if he testifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.665" offset="5842004">And if he proceeds to testify, he gets protection regarding that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.190" offset="5880142">That is automatically giving him whether he claims the privilege or not in regard to any testimony that he gives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.670" offset="5922043">And that protection concerning that testimony is less than the protection or the immunity he would get under Section 2447 of the Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.842" offset="5982751">In that, it protects him concerning the use of that testimony and any of its fruits but not -- does not extend to the coverage of matter, thing or transaction involved in 2447.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.197" offset="6076165">Or is the same kind of protection that the Court described and provided in Murphy against Waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.965" offset="6135202">This case, we think is controlled by the decisions of this Court in Nelson, Beilan and Lerner against Casey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.051" offset="6183581">Except that since those cases, this Court has moved on and included Murphy against Waterfront and Garrity so that a person called before the grand jury has protections that were not present in any of the three cases that I've named.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.775" offset="6286503">Beyond that, this inquiry by definition in the constitution and also in the charter provision is a limited inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.927" offset="6339062">It does not relate to security risk and loyalty and other elements that are involved in those cases but to -- is in precisely the question of the performance by the party involved of his official duties in that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.061" offset="6443656">Now, this case dramatically presents that problem.</text>
