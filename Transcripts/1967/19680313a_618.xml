            <label>Mr. Robert C. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="44.220" offset="280221">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.948" offset="299133">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.381" offset="324942">The respondent, plaintiff below is engaged in the business of licensing films and cartoons to television stations to be broadcasted by those stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.805" offset="370604">The petitioner on two community antenna systems is charged with copyright infringement by reason of the reception of the broadcasts of the movies and cartoons by the stations licensed by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.939" offset="443120">There are two basic issues on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.623" offset="457853">First is the reception of a broadcast signaled by the petitioner, CATV, and the transmission or the conducting of that signal by wire to the homes of the subscribers without sight or sound being involved a performance in public of the copyrighted works within the meaning of Sections 1 (c) and 1 (d) of the copyrighter.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.694" offset="570180">The second and related issue is whether when a broadcast has been licensed by a copyright owner, as it has been here.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.816" offset="602676">A member of the public has a license implied in law under the Copyright Act and the Communications Act to receive off the air and enjoy the authorized broadcast by the use of a receiving antenna of his choice, including subscribing to the service of a community antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.390" offset="688880">Petitioner's two community antenna systems were located in Clarksburg and Fairmont, West Virginia, two towns in --.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.321" offset="724616">Just by West Virginia is hilly, rugged, and mountainous.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.809" offset="746559">In 1952 when the systems began, the only television stations in the area were in Pittsburgh and in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.076" offset="787728">In 1953, the stations in Wheeling, West Virginia and Steubenville, Ohio began broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.551" offset="813537">They were -- these were the only stations that the people in this area had from which they could get any television service.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.654" offset="846033">These stations were some distance away from Clarksburg and Fairmont.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.774" offset="858467">They're some 50 to 65 miles from Fairmont and a little bit farther from Clarksburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.348" offset="884799">As I said, the area here is mountainous and the towns are in hilly areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.866" offset="902875">Most of the houses are in valleys but there are also houses and people who live on the hills and in and around the towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.616" offset="929834">This is also an area where the winters are harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.585" offset="941746">As a result of the winds and ice, the tall antennas on poles presented problems with the householders.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.558" offset="973615">As a result, many Clarksburg and Fairmont residents found it convenient to subscribe to the petitioner's service rather than put up their own antennas.Others joined in cooperation with their neighbors and put up cooperative antennas.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.256" offset="1032443">Coops of this kind still exist in these communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.085" offset="1047698">Others subscribed to community antennas other than those owning to petitioner and those systems still exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.363" offset="1084792">We suggest that the petitioner systems are classic examples of CATV put up where the terrain and the distance made reception difficult for the people in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.007" offset="1131395">We were performing this service which Mr. Gellar said yesterday the Commission had found to be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.224" offset="1164309">And perhaps, West Virginia is a classical area for the community antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.988" offset="1183326">Figures that were writ -- issued recently suggest that more than 25% -- more than 20% of the homes in that area depend on community antenna for their television service.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.985" offset="1231287">The Court has just heard community antenna discussed in very general terms in the Southwestern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.386" offset="1256887">The facts in this case are not in dispute but I think it is important that I state not only what community antenna does, but also what it does not do because there is confusion and a number of allegations that do not apply to the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.488" offset="1337344">In order to operate, every television set must have an antenna and there must be a connection between the antenna and the receiving set.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.321" offset="1380707">In most cases, the antenna is built in to the television set itself and most people in metropolitan areas use the built-in antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.289" offset="1416547">Others use rabbit ears, others put antennas on top of their houses or on poles, depending on their interest in television service and how much they wish to spend for an antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.663" offset="1462000">But in all instances, they must have an antenna and the connection from the antenna to the set for the set to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.034" offset="1491466">Now, the sole activity of the petitioner's antenna system was to put up an antenna and to provide an antenna connection or a wire connection to the set.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.819" offset="1530650">We had antennas on telephone poles or on structures, on hills near the towns, and they were connected to the towns by wire coaxial cable and distributed along the cables were amplifiers in order to maintain the strength of the signal because it losses its strength as it passes through the wires.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.496" offset="1613406">The respondent's expert testified that the function of our antenna system is the same as that of a home antenna or an apartment house antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.017" offset="1663457">Petitioner systems received the entire broadcast of the stations and it was able to receive -- there was no editing or deletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.461" offset="1697207">The service provided was instantaneous and simultaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.530" offset="1713507">There was no recording or transcriptions made of any broadcasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.498" offset="1733360">The petitioner did not originate any programs and had no equipment to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.943" offset="1755094">I wish to characterize the service but there is no doubt as to what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.741" offset="1774320">We provided a service for a flat fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.137" offset="1787904">We charged just a flat fee regardless of whether any programs were watched by the subscribers.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.995" offset="1863346">There's a connection by coaxial cables strung along telephone poles on the streets, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.103" offset="1883826">And from that coaxial cable, there's what is called a drop, a connecting cable that goes into the house itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.911" offset="1910993">It goes into the house and the subscriber attaches it to his own television set within his house.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.022" offset="1991450">We of the -- each system received five stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.220" offset="2016214">There are therefore ten station system situations, all of them were received off the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.396" offset="2048920">In five of the instances, we are receiving what the Commission calls local stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.274" offset="2072430">That is the system was within the Grade B contour of the station itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.862" offset="2094791">And the other five instances, we were virtually on or very near the Grade B contour of the station.</text>

            <text syncTime="938.427" offset="3857115">There are several additional undisputed facts that I'd like to call to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.038" offset="3879476">I mentioned the fact that every one of these broadcasts that were involved here were licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.676" offset="3898075">There's no contention that the broadcasts are infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.983" offset="3911346">We received all of the signals off the air and the -- what we conduct or transmit is electromagnetic energy and the respondent claims no copyright in the electromagnetic energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.445" offset="3965158">The only rendition, if there is any, is in the homes of the subscribers and there is no contention that that viewing is an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.084" offset="4007685">A copyright is a completely statutory right and whatever is claimed by the copyright owner must be found within the four corners of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.043" offset="4043525">Sections 1 (c) and 1 (d) confirm on the copyright owner the exclusive right to perform the copyrighted work.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.610" offset="4073827">But in order to be an infringement however, there must be two separate elements shown as required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.420" offset="4101099">First, there must be a performance of the copyrighted work, and second, the performance must be in public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.533" offset="4129520">In the case of 1 (c), there is a third element for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.732" offset="4154284">I emphasize these separate elements because the respondent has endeavored to collapse them into one in public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.585" offset="4189706">There must first be a performance and then in public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.003" offset="4203395">It makes no difference whether it's in public or private if it's not a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.403" offset="4225024">The number of the subscribers which we have may be relevant to the issue whether it's in public but that issue is reached only if it's first found that there is a performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.709" offset="4270164">So I then turn to the question which I regard as the key question, whether we perform the copyrighted work, that is whether receiving the signal off the air, conducting it through a wire with amplifiers and with the equipment that we use to the homes of the subscribers without sight or sound is a performance within the meaning of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.782" offset="4362533">The guiding principles for the construction of the Copyright Act were set forth by this Court in the White Smith against the Apollo Company case many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.342" offset="4404746">There, the issue was whether a perforated role, piano player role was a copy within the meaning of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.521" offset="4437452">It was no doubt that you could use the role to reproduce the music and they were the economic arguments made there which are like those made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.162" offset="4472038">However, the Court held there that this was not a copy and in reaching that conclusion laid down the construction of the copyright statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.516" offset="4505475">It said that you should not use strained and artificial meaning in construing the words but the words should be construed as the Court said using its words in terms of the ordinary sense, the common understanding or the generally understood meanings of the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.164" offset="4576005">And it's this construction which we think if applicable here indicates that what we do is not to perform the copyrighted work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.773" offset="4610487">The Court of Appeals did not consider what would be the ordinary meaning of the word “perform”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.367" offset="4636818">The District Court did consider it but recognized that the meaning it was adopting was not that which an ordinary layman would use for the word perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.506" offset="4673390">We believe that if the courts below had followed the standard of the ordinary meaning of the words, they would have recognized that the word “perform” in the copyright statute means providing a visible and audible rendition of the work, a rendition of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.366" offset="4740786">We think this is the meaning that Congress had in mind when it passed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.329" offset="4756668">It was concerned primarily with the problem of stage plays and people who came in and took stenographic notes or transcriptions of the play with the intention of giving an authorized performance at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.056" offset="4807555">Congress is also concerned with the Nickelodeon what it called the graphic phone and the phonograph and the player piano.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.667" offset="4838066">Indeed in Section 1 (e) which is not involved here, the so-called jukebox provision, in order to provide and exception from the public performance provision for a jukebox, the Congress had to say that a rendition or a reproduction of the music was not a public performance except where admission were charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.874" offset="4910895">This is in my -- our minds a clear indication of the relationship between rendition sight and sound and performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.682" offset="4946108">We believe that to hold that by receiving a broadcast signal and conducting those signals with whatever equipment is needed to maintain their strength to the homes of their subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.855" offset="4986755">Without sight or sound is not a performance within the ordinary meaning of the word and does not meet the standards which this Court laid down in the White Smith case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.234" offset="10080319">And as the solicitor has said, copyrights are concentrated in the hands of the networks and seven movie companies, either because of back damages, and respondent is claiming $250.00 minimum damage for every cartoon and every movie which we received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.949" offset="10155133">On the basis of that claim, we would be incurring damages at the rate of $1 million a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.104" offset="10187839">Obviously, this opens the way to take over the community antenna business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.070" offset="10211662">But even apart from the past damages, there's no doubt that if copyright infringement is imposed, they will be able to control the community antennas for the purposes of -- for their own purposes obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.874" offset="10270908">There's nothing to prevent them from putting a community antenna on a business by the size of the fee they would charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.937" offset="10295150">And indeed, they have said that we were carrying programs into areas that they would otherwise like to exploit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.203" offset="10324198">So clearly, they want to cut off the reception of the programs in those areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.244" offset="10388355">The Solicitor General acknowledges this and we offered to prove that the copyright owner had been paid not only for the audience of the station but the audience which included the CATV subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.502" offset="10437360">What the broadcasters and the NA - National Association of Broadcasters' brief and it makes clear the respondent says here they want to control the competition between stations for their own purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.200" offset="10524191">They want to supplant the regulation of reception by license exclusivity, license agreements to supplant the regulation which the FCC as found to be in the public interest has been explained to you in the case just preceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.331" offset="10584691">And we suggest that it is the same power in the use of exclusive territories which concerned the court in the Schwene case and the Albreck case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.633" offset="11005889">The only point we have made is that when the broadcast -- when the copyright owner decides to license a broadcast, the public has a right to receive that broadcast off the air with its antenna of its choice, including CATV, and that the copyright owner cannot control that reception or put a second charge on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.065" offset="11087600">Respondent says there is no such license implied in law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.185" offset="12388080">In the NBC case, the court commented on the fact that the public interest would be served by the Communications Act is the interest of the listening public in the greater and more efficient use of radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.742" offset="12438340">I assume today, the Court would speak of the viewing public as well as the listening public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.255" offset="12456417">Nothing in the Act restricts the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.712" offset="12466239">Nothing in the laws restricts the right of a member of the public to use any antenna it chooses for any set he chooses for a reception of a broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.304" offset="12508557">And as I say, we believe this is confirmed by the industry economics which we offered a proof that the broadcaster has contemplates the audience which include the community antenna subscriber.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.419" offset="12565086">The license has been paid for broadcast to that public and that therefore the public should have the right to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.084" offset="12591731">The Solicitor General acknowledges a license implied in law but he limits the -- limits it to the state -- what he calls the station service area or the B contour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.982" offset="12635303">He proposes this limit not because this marks the end of the limit where you can receive a broadcast off the air but because it is in his words a good rule of thumb and because and we believe this is correct that it is certain, there is a map of FCC for every station marking out the contour, A contour and B contour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.589" offset="12729762">Moreover, the Commissions regulations of CATV are geared to the B contour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.618" offset="12749824">It's the station within which the system is located if it's to B Contour, it's known as the local station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.654" offset="12782007">Now the Commission has made clear that CATV provides an important service in connection with its allocations plan and in the recent decision last February 23rd in a so called Shen Heist case, the Commission made clear what it meant by that because there, it ordered the community antenna to receive a signal and to give the station a non-duplication protection even though the station did not put a viewable signal in the Commissions word over any part of the CATV community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.501" offset="12913351">This means that the Commission is regarding the community antennas as a means of assuring service of the stations and in Mr. Hyde's words under the Commission's regulations, community antennas are providing the antenna service which he regards as being the proper service to be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.533" offset="12993494">If a judicial limitation is to be constructed on the right of the people of the people -- public to receive off the air then we agree that the B contour is the only reasonable limit but we point out particularly in this case for the receptions of the air that all the receptions within the B or very near the B involves no significant extension of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.697" offset="13082206">The Solicitor General has said that he favors an interpretation which harmonizes the Copyright Act and the Federal Communications Act and the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.163" offset="13116061">We believe that this will lead to the conclusion that CATV reception is not performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.329" offset="13140720">However, if it worked to be held to be performance then implying a license brings about what the Solicitor General has called the coalescence of these laws but he coalescence is only partial unless the public has the right to receive off the air for surely there are still the same tendency or dangers of monopolistic practices in the event that the B contour marks the limit because they're just across the line of the copyright owners control takes over, he can substitute his systems of exclusivity, can rollback the public's use of CATV for television service and can in short control, competing -- competition between stations for his own benefit in exporting his copyright monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.989" offset="13331310">If there is to be a limit on the public's right to receive and we suggest that it should be by the Congress and should not be constructed by the court by a strained expansion of the words of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.694" offset="13378121">I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.165" offset="13400064">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.796" offset="13426604">The picture of what is involved in this copyright dispute is so contrary to a four weeks trial with experts, thousands of pages of depositions, the finding of the trial court in a profound 74 page printed opinion and the unanimous affirmance by Court of Appeals in the 24 page printed opinion that I think I'd better stop to dissipate the notion that we're dealing with rooftop antennas which are not copyright infringements at all and explained briefly at the out set what this system is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.059" offset="13591594">It has just as Clarksburg and Fairmont system has steel towers, a hundred feet high connected with a cat volt of 25 feet with five antennas arrays.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.938" offset="13659094">It has a head-in equipment which is as extensive as a broadcasting stations equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.018" offset="13687411">It has 665 miles of cable and strands on 10,000 poles for which a franchise has been obtained from this two cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.416" offset="13744985">It has ten men to maintain the system, two of them engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.325" offset="13764629">It has 2,000 to 3,000 tubes in both systems as compared with the 150 tubes in a transmitter of a small broadcasting station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.529" offset="13805484">It cost the small equipment $750,000.00 to a million dollars without the head-in equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.592" offset="13849788">The installation charges were $200.00 a month or a $110.00 and $6.00 monthly charge, meaning a collection of $630,000.00 a year for this small equipment from 15,000 subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.621" offset="13913840">So that when Your Honor, I ask whether you could direct the same kind of antenna, if Your Honor wish to spend $800,000.00 direct to these towers and ten engineers and then to run it, you could.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="3499.963" offset="14103176">Right now, it's function is not to send out to thousands of subscribers or less a picture through a treatment and change of channel in this complex, sophisticated equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.157" offset="14163989">It doesn't advertise for subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.927" offset="14175065">It is as much a facility in the house, let's say a refrigerator or anything else that is supplied in order to facilitate the rental arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.049" offset="14223548">There's actually no profit made in those situations but it's usually a charge to keep a thousand antennas off the roof so that each band doesn't have an antenna and the accidents which result to their problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.613" offset="14269837">The trial court and the Court of Appeals did not make any finding that there was a master antenna case involved here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.100" offset="14311737">No one has ever claimed that it's a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.281" offset="14320515">The thoughts here as well as that of damages which I shall address myself too are simply to avoid the simple issue that a CATV system takes copyright material and pays nothing for it while all the stations, local stations it competes with are paying for that property, hundreds of thousand, indeed millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.927" offset="14407032">We want the CATV systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.955" offset="14419153">It provides with the copyright on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.453" offset="14429184">It provides a new market and we hope they prosper as indeed they are but not without paying a license fee and keeping the unjust enrichment which they receive from these moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.358" offset="14484773">Now, there are six points that I've observed that counsel made at the outset of this argument which by choice of sort of anticipated rebuttal, I will address myself to briefly before treating more completely the issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.087" offset="14579754">CATV bespeaks the public interest in receiving free telecast yet it along in the entire broadcast industry imposes a direct charge on the public for television reception and the evidence given before various Senate Committees that it receives a 72% profit on its collections and a 59% profit on its capital investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.297" offset="14684557">These extraordinary figures of course due to the fact that they don't pay for the merchandise they sell which is the royalties they ought to pay for the copyrighted material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.266" offset="14724472">CATV claims deep concern for anti competitive consequences of the copy -- if the Copyright law is applied to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.642" offset="14757909">Yet CATV engages in the most deadly unfair competition with the local TV stations since it pays nothing for programs for which the local station pay 63% of its operating cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.430" offset="14817050">Indeed in this very case Your Honor, the evidence is that the local TV station in Clarksburg, WBOY was bought out by the petitioner CATV since its cost could not compete within any more than a grocery store could compete with any other store when it paid for its merchandise and its competitor did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.397" offset="14904926">The FCC has reported in its second order that it cannot consider CATV operation “a fair method of competition with local stations”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.269" offset="14960410">CATV protested that it is not dealing with programs but it's only on antenna service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.261" offset="14988413">But when WBOY is a very local TV station before it succumb, subscribed to the petitioner's TV system -- CATV system and then rebroadcast a program that had received on this subscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.843" offset="15062706">The petitioner laid a trap by cutting off its own broadcast and putting on the air and announcement “trouble on the network” it incidentally shows that they can originate with them and send out their own messages which 159 of them do originate programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.163" offset="15136057">And when this sign appeared on WBOY's broadcast, a letter followed from the petitioner which is an evidence demanding that WBOY be ceased from “rebroadcasting programs” our programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.695" offset="15198124">Thus the petitioner who has choose the word program in describing its activities, considered someone else's retransmission of a CATV broadcast an appropriation of its program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.996" offset="15259355">CATV pleads that its activity does not involve a corporeal right which could be the subject of a copyright license that it did only propagates electromagnetic energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.888" offset="15314944">Yet when a railroad worker in Clarksburg tapped a CATV cable to get the program into his home, the petitioner, CATV induced the District Attorney to have a warrant of arrest issued and the accused was confined in jail for 12 to 18 hours because he couldn't raise the bail and thereafter was convicted and pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.680" offset="15398118">The petitioner was so intent on protecting its program, its property from being siphoned off that it resorted to the criminal laws but when the creators of literary works seek to protect their rights under the copyright statute, CATV tells them they have none because it is transmitting a femoral electromagnetic energy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4498.770" offset="18098448">This extension of signal by CATV directly affects its basic plan for allocating free television service throughout United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4522.422" offset="18193011">In giving the impression to this in capable of coping with the giant broadcasting industry and therefore the potential victim of anti competitive pressures, the fact is that CATV operators now include the largest industrial complexes in the United States such General Electric, Westinghouse, Time Life, Western Union, APCO, Scripts Howard, General Telephone and Electrics Used Aircraft Company and many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.628" offset="18305860">And multiple ownership is common 25 owners controls 671 franchises with 394 applications pending in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.038" offset="18363538">CATV National Executives therefore have taken the position now that they are far more responsible executives in the industry representing these large companies that they do not object.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.075" offset="18419649">They have made public statements on it which is quoting in one of the amicus curiae briefs by director of Cox Broadcasting one of the large CATV operators and a director of the national association of which he said a recent court ruling implies that the CATV operators maybe required to pay fees for the privilege of transmitting copyrighted material to cable television subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.350" offset="18520795">It has been suggested that this would impose a critical financial burden of the operators in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.675" offset="18546082">The answer -- the alarm is not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.089" offset="18559770">Copyright fees are a normal cost of doing business in many fields and as in radio and television today, they would constitute a relatively small element in their total cost of providing a service desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.006" offset="18607417">There is therefore no fear in the industry actually except this counsel attempts to present it that paying a fair minor portion of their unjust enrichment as we view it to the artist who create the material within any way sacrificed their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.669" offset="18690069">The Solicitor General in his Southwestern Cable brief says, “CATV poses a genuine threat to potential harm to the public interest and possible frustration of Congress' goal.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4678.403" offset="18817024">$37 million in Philadelphia and it is estimated that there will be a $30 million annual income from one borrows in Manhattan, in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.651" offset="18865925">It is against this background Your Honors, so different from the miniature depiction of the petition that we turn to his argument for an applied license in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.861" offset="18930813">We shall assume for this discussion as the petitioner must arguendo when he argues for an applied license that a CATV transmission is a performance under the Copyright law and I shall as time permits later deal with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.259" offset="19012420">But assuming a performance is there an implied license of law in favor of CATV which exempts it from being an infringer under the Copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.523" offset="19061426">The District Court in its scholarly opinion said there was no implied license in law concluding “neither the policy nor language of the Federal Communications Act nor its regulations are intended to or have the effect of repealing or modifying Section 1 of the Copyright law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.500" offset="19149406">The Court finds no basis for concluding that defendant is the beneficiary of any license implied in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.488" offset="19177305">The Court of Appeals agreed specifically residing, rejecting the theory of double payment as a justification for an applied license in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.841" offset="19222758">It concluded “a resolution of such issues of broadcasting economics has not been entrusted to the courts through the Copyright Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.851" offset="19262777">The Solicitor General agrees with the courts below that they can be no implied license applicable to all programs “whatever their source and wherever reproduced”.</text>

            <text syncTime="4872.014" offset="19591398">The Copyright law grants to the copyright owner, exclusive right not merely to one public performance or to any limited number of performances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.804" offset="19634552">But as this Court phrased it expressly to all public performances for profit without limitation, a copyright infringement does not depend on the pleas of the performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.109" offset="19691813">To grant upon the statute unequivocal, unambiguous and absolute grant of right to the copyright owner, a limitation of such right is the privilege only of the legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="5482.138" offset="22031966">It didn't come into play in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.192" offset="22040116">Justice -- Mr. Justice Brandeis said it very clearly in the Buck-LaSalle case and if I have the time, I'd like to refer it to this specific analysis of that point which he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.530" offset="22089540">Now, implied in law Your Honor, it connotes that some condition is imposed at least on one of the parties and therefore is equivalent to a compulsory license but when the Copyright statute intended to provide a compulsory license, it did so high further for example Section 1 (e) Music.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.309" offset="22176580">There is a compulsory license for records to a sense of that but this compulsory license was conditioned in the statute upon special registration formalities and periodical accountings under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.388" offset="22244916">But when Congress intended also a complete exemption under the Copyright Act and also, you have to provide it explicitly in this Copyright statute when it exempted jukeboxes from any copyright liability whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.939" offset="22307088">Incidentally Your Honors that is worth noting that at the time that this exemption was urged upon the Congress, it was on the theory that it was a minor advertising device at any powers they have now become a $500 million a year industry without paying a cent of the composers and musicians at least until the new Copyright Act goes into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.627" offset="22397889">I think that is going to be changed Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.596" offset="22409801">This illustrates the danger even for the legislature in granting exemptions when the art may prosper subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.090" offset="22447731">In this case, the CATV we're dealing already with the giant and to imply a license, a concept to which binds lower guardian law in this field at all on the unwanted grounds of judicial flexibility to cover out special privileges as unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.552" offset="22537592">In Buck against LaSalle too Your Honor, it was urged to make an acception to the Copyright Act to the benefit of hotel keepers who used radio broadcast for its own commercial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.529" offset="22589524">Mr. Justice Brandeis said there, the existing statute makes no such exception and if one is to be made, it must be done by the legislature and not the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.370" offset="22632887">Now, the petitioner and the Solicitor General, contend that a license implied in law under the Copyright Act results from what they turn communications policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.690" offset="22682102">Communications policy can only have two sources Your Honor, the Act itself and the actions of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="5696.937" offset="22891081">Yes Your Honor, that's the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.442" offset="22917099">The CATV has taken the position Your Honor that for the Commission has taken the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.566" offset="22941654">The CATV which leads the phase for its programs Your Honors the exclusive rights of the local TV station to programs for which it pays is unfair competition and wishes to limit that in order to increase the competitive opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.152" offset="23003930">I wish to insert the other fact that the legislative purpose was also to encourage UHF development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.759" offset="23034441">That's ultra high frequency is against very high frequency that has 70 possibilities and this was not making headway Your Honor until the Congress passed a special statute requiring all television sets to have UHF reception and you now see it on every television set.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.938" offset="23107166">And for a while Your Honor UHF began to grow but when the CATV group, it was preposterous to expect the UHF station to make its investment and also go into the field in competition with someone who got the product free for which UHF would have had to pay a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.206" offset="23192221">And the Commission stated clearly that the reason why it was necessary in the public interest to adopt the carriage requirement which I think was explained to you Your Honors this morning, the non-duplication rule and the distant signal rule and the reason for this and here, I have the quotation Mr. Justice Fortas was to ameliorate the risk the bargaining CATV industry would have a future adverse impact on television broadcast service both existing and potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.681" offset="23314056">That's in the second order in 725.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.156" offset="23327953">In short Your Honor, the Commission emphasized not once but many times that the condition it was trying to overcome resulted from the inability of the present copyrighter to enforce their rights with respect to CATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.800" offset="23402559">For example, the Commission said on another occasion in the light of the unequal footing on which the broadcasters and CATV systems now stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.772" offset="23438503">We cannot regard any CATV systems duplication of local programming via the signals of distant stations is a fair method of computation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.558" offset="23473612">That's also in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.367" offset="23488867">I have one more quotation on the question you're asked Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.896" offset="23506944">The Commission said that “we cannot close our eyes to the significance which the present inability of program supplies to control the availability of their programs via CATV has from petition between CATV and broadcasting station.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5869.382" offset="23580923">Now this being the one and only communication policy based on the inability of copyright owners to enforce the existing law against CATV and the consequent burdens placed on the Commission by the intransigence of CATV, how anomalous it is to argue that it is necessary to exempt CATV from copyright liability in order to coalesce the communications policy with the Copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.871" offset="23714879">In the petitioners replied brief, he contends that it is not as reasserted as to policy and he quotes the FCC the second order paragraph 47 to the effect that quote -- that Commission goal was to integrate CATV service into the national television structure in such a way as to promote maximum television service to both those who are cable viewers and those dependent and off their service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.774" offset="23846431">The petitioner has however omitted the very next sentence of the passage which reads “the new rules discussed below, that's the carriage and duplication distant signal rules are the minimum measures we believe to be essential to ensure that CATV continues to perform its valuable supplemental role without unduly damaging or impeding the growth of television broadcasting service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5962.456" offset="23953220">So I repeat Your Honor, there is only one CATV communication policy with respect to CATV and it lends no support to any theory for an implied license.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.528" offset="24021452">Now who would benefit from the exemption sought and at whose expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="5992.834" offset="24074742">Well, the implied in law theory contrary to the precise language giving us exclusive rights for every public performance without limitation is a misnomer and as a semantic, wittingly or unwittingly a semantic device to put a good color on an impossible concept in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.054" offset="24171604">So we have translated it to be what it must be even a compulsory license or an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.259" offset="24196368">It can't be anything else because there is no warrant to say under this Act that one can apply on how he make it and with what the guarantees to the owner to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="6109.160" offset="24540035">The Court finally -- the Chief Justice and the District Court said we will put a note to this delay and we will try this case in separate sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.697" offset="24582144">We will try first the copyright infringement, is there one?</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.014" offset="24599385">And then after we will put aside implied license in fact in other words by giving a license to the copyright -- to the station, have we thereby granted a license to CATV.</text>
            <text syncTime="6137.156" offset="24652048">They have that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.024" offset="24655496">It will be tried subsequently Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6141.019" offset="24667408">And damages had been put aside and the law is clear that there can be no oppressive damages such as it's been feared here and the stopple and ledges and all the other defenses have been put aside and after six years, we finally got to an issue where we could come to grips with this question while our copyrights were dying due to the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6164.015" offset="24759463">They were running out and due to the statute of limitations of three years once you know you have a claim and everyday that goes fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.968" offset="24791228">We lose those rights for these arguments and it was to stop that that the courts split this case into four parts and many of the matters which our adversary refers to, he will have a full day in court after this case is decided by Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6189.093" offset="24859773">Now, who would profit from this exemption?</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.430" offset="24881089">The CATV who never creates anything except those 159 stations that are beginning to originate programs, I think they do.</text>

            <text syncTime="6563.520" offset="26357426">They took full advantage of that in their advertising and there were letters of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6569.966" offset="26383235">One of which was by the manager of a CATV system saying, “We have this baseball we're going to bring you in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.553" offset="26417612">It was close to World Series time or might have been World Series.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6694.024" offset="26879457">But far more important than merely audience at least 15,000 subscribers added to a million viewers, far more important is how many stations are there in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.259" offset="26924387">That's what creates the competition and then it gives us a chance to get more money where as one station, we have very much bargaining power and also, how much inventory have they if the station has bought motion pictures from Warner Brothers and United Artist comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.403" offset="26981021">It is not a very good position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6721.379" offset="26988857">So that the economic factors here are not -- are completely over simplified where it is said just more audience, more money.</text>

            <text syncTime="6965.329" offset="27964688">I find a little hard to recognize the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6969.522" offset="27981511">This is a case of statutory construction involving the meaning of the word “perform” as it appears in the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.977" offset="28023306">Mr. Nizer refers to criminal prosecution in 1954 involving a man who cut the cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.211" offset="28060191">He talks about station WBOY, this is discussed in our reply brief footnote 25 and I commend the Court to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6999.912" offset="28103032">The only theory on which he tried to bring this within the statute is that there has been a reception or a transmission as he says for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7011.735" offset="28150262">The statute doesn't read on reception or transmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.710" offset="28162173">The statute reads on perform and there is no element of profit in Section 1 (d) but there is in 1 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="7022.540" offset="28193520">The statutes briefs on perform and in public.</text>
            <text syncTime="7026.697" offset="28210134">Mr. Nizer says that he does not wish to cover master antennas but there is no way in which you can exclude master antennas if reception and transmission are to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="7038.607" offset="28257782">That's exactly what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7041.906" offset="28270947">It doesn't make any difference that a man pays for his master antenna service and his rent rather than pays directly for the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="7049.498" offset="28301354">Mr. Nizer talked about advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="7051.190" offset="28308146">Is it -- does it make any difference as to whether a man advertises or not as to whether he performs is -- performing when it says something in its ad about ads for television sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="7064.338" offset="28360704">You can see the World Series game, is that performing the World Series game?</text>
            <text syncTime="7068.515" offset="28377422">I don't understand this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7069.440" offset="28381184">I don't understand the relevance of this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7071.732" offset="28390275">We must somehow rather get back to the statute and look to see what these systems do and how it fits the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7079.863" offset="28422875">Mr. Nizer talked about the expensive equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7083.097" offset="28435728">We hope our equipments could.We tried to buy good equipment and we hope we provide a decent service to our people and we'll certainly try to do better for our subscribers if we can.</text>

            <text syncTime="7106.481" offset="28529246">In 1952, the Congress amended Section 1 (c) specifically with reference to broadcasting thus making a claim that the Congress thought that broadcasting was covered within the scope of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="7146.325" offset="28688697">He talks about the Federal Communications Commission being concerned with this matter because copyright infringement has not been imposed on a community antenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="7156.376" offset="28728926">This is just plain not correct as Mr. Gellar said today, the Commission has found the community antenna provides a valuable service in connection with the reception in the service areas of the stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.835" offset="28786709">This is precisely what it does and this is precisely what we do.</text>

            <text syncTime="7182.451" offset="28833207">Our position is that the public policy underlying the Copyright Act and the Communications Act should be considered by the Court when it is deciding whether or not to extend the meaning of a word performs in a noble area, an area not contemplated by the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="7211.331" offset="28948668">We select the programs in the sense that our systems were capable of receiving five stations and we receive five, we didn't receive six.</text>
