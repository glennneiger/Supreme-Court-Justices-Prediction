            <label>Mr. Harold A. Liebenson</label>
            <text syncTime="32.299" offset="232573">May it please Your Honor and Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.415" offset="249083">I believe that we have to start a little bit with the facts in this case because of the unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.819" offset="294640">You have an occurrence that took place on January 26 in 1961 where a man was injured at a gateway elevator company where there were no eyewitnesses, where the time was unknown, where he was working as a button man and his type of work and he was allegedly struck on the forehead with some steel, but no one saw this and there’s no evidence in the record to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.922" offset="439045">The only thing there was in the record was a statement that there was a little tiny black mark on his forehead.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.391" offset="484916">This particular case came to trial before the Longshoremen Commissioner and on the evidence, he made a finding that there’s no evidence of this man being injured on January 26th in the course of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.016" offset="579480">Thereafter I happen to get in the case and I heard about another occurrence which took place on January 30th 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.151" offset="623992">Now it should be pointed out that on January 30th about two hours after this occurrence, the man came home and from the top of his steps suddenly catapulted from the top of the steps to the basement no evidence of tripping and no evidence of the man protecting himself, in other words his hands his hands didn't go forward or anything to do anything to, for self-protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.408" offset="757008">Now, when this man fell, he remained unconscious till his death on February 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.705" offset="802147">When the case came to trial at the first hearing, the respondent had in its possession a statement from an eyewitness to the occurrence of January 30th, but this was not made known and you now have a widow bringing the action, not a person who was injured and alive and who can tell about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.310" offset="916564">On January 30th, I'm sorry let me go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.044" offset="935581">Subsequent to this, I filed a -- I heard about the witness and I filed a lawsuit a third party action in the Federal Court and I subpoenaed the insurance company record and I obtained a copy of the statement that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.362" offset="1004857">Now, the statement was dated on April 8, 1961, the hearing on this first occurrence was on January 26, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.960" offset="1043205">At no time during this January 26, 1961 hearing is there anything about an occurrence that took place on January 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.059" offset="1091584">Now the occurrence that took place at January 30th took place at another elevator, a distance away.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.789" offset="1126484">It was -- the man was doing a different type of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.050" offset="1143620">He was -- there was an eyewitness who saw this and saw that he -- wherein he was hit on the top of the head from approximately 30 pounds of rope that fell about 50 feet and the man was seen rubbing his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.609" offset="1217808">Now, this case after it was tried in the Federal Court, the jury brought in a verdict in our favor for the maximum which was $30,000 and subsequent thereto the trial judge entered an order of remittitur of $11,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.817" offset="1334627">The Court of Appeals, I stepped out of the case basically because the government took over at that time, and the Court of Appeals held that the first occurrence was res judicata of the second occurrence and the basis for the Court of Appeals' ruling was number one, they cite the Baltimore versus Phillips, a steamship case at 274 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.062" offset="1459597">Wherein the, there is no comparison as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.379" offset="1480913">In that particular case there was a sailor who sued under the Admiralty Act for maintenance and cure and negligence and unseaworthiness and then after there was a verdict in that case then he went to another court and brought another action under the Jones Act case and the Court probably said, well your rights were determined in this first hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.057" offset="1663561">That -- is that, does 70 mean this is, the statute provides a computation which produces 70,000.</text>

          <turn speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="398.018" stopTime="616.506">
            <label>Mr. Harold A. Liebenson</label>
            <text syncTime="398.018" offset="1695431">Yes sir, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.502" offset="1701386">I mean I think that would be the ultimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.813" offset="1718627">Now, so then the other basis that the Court of Appeals gives is that Section 22 is not applicable and they say the reason it's not applicable because there was at no time was there a disputing of the findings of fact within the 30 days under Section 921 and they cite the case of Flamm versus Hughes 329 F.2d 378 and that case is not in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.360" offset="1860838">That was a case where they were testing the constitutionality of the Section, where -- Section 921, where there was n change in conditions and there was no additional evidence, that counsel in his brief doesn't rely on the case of Flamm versus Hughes or doesn't cite that, cite it.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.846" offset="1946728">Whereas on page 14 of our brief we cite about five or six cases which clearly holds that Section 22 does apply in -- after 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.356" offset="2004825">The other basis that the Court of Appeals gives is that Section 22 doesn't apply because the Deputy Commissioner was not aware of the January 30th accident until more than one year after the rejection of the claim and this was clearly erroneous because on the record it shows that the second claim was filed one and a half months after the occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.186" offset="2116106">So we have all three basis of the court incorrect in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.006" offset="2159365">Our contention here is that Section 22 precludes the doctrine of the defense of res judicata during the year following a decision of a Deputy Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.077" offset="2211715">I think that was the purpose of the act, that was a purpose that it was put into it, that was a purpose that they amended the act and our reading the act makes it very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.396" offset="2268975">After all you're dealing with people who have come before a person who is in most instances not a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.791" offset="2310562">They have no discovery procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.593" offset="2321742">They try to make it as simple as possible although I do believe that discovery procedure should be permitted in this type of a case and the counsel contends that there is discovery procedure, but I can't see it because the way the statute is worded, they're talking about testimony and this is very similar to the case I had before this Court in the case of Minor versus Atlas where this Court held that a local rule which allowed discovery procedure was unconstitutional because there was no provision in the statute for it and the words almost similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.124" offset="2495822">What they're talking about is testimony, the power to take testimony of a Deputy Commissioner and not to make -- have interrogatories or to have adverse witness procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.920" offset="2563009">I hope --</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.386" offset="4952900">If we appealed this case the only person who would gain by the appeal would be the attorney or myself because if successful on the appeal I would get a larger fee, whereas if I didn't appeal, I still had a record of a jury verdict holding that on the 30th of January this man was killed as a result of being injured in the course of his employment and the other side would be entitled to the credit anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.534" offset="5089468">So that my people by accepting $19000 did not lose anything because the other side would get the credit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.315" offset="5968645">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.375" offset="5992887">As has been developed in the argument there are three issues in this case, the determination of any one of which requires the reversal of the award entered by the Deputy Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.209" offset="6068224">The first is a question of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.213" offset="6084211">This is the issue that was determined by the Court of Appeals and on a finding that it should be applied, it did reverse the deputy commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.159" offset="6124022">The other issue of whether or not there was a compromise has not been determined and there is also issue of substantiality of the evidence and the cause of connection which was not reached by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.244" offset="6184312">The argument now appears to agree and the briefed now appear to agree which was not true in the Court of Appeals that the doctrine of res judicata maybe applied to administrative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.282" offset="6232482">We suggest to the Court that of all the wide variety of administrative determinations, the determination of the liability issue in a compensation case most of all requires a strict application of the Doctrine of Res judicata because it is a judicial determination that is a nature of a judicial determination and is a determination of a past fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.017" offset="6347421">I like to call the Court's attention very briefly to the purpose of this statute the Workmen's Compensation Statute, Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.792" offset="6390575">This type of social legislation came about as a result of the situation that obtained the time of the industrial revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.365" offset="6436864">Work connected injuries were going uncompensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.070" offset="6451702">The employee found himself in the position most frequently where he had no recovery for on the job injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.263" offset="6488377">The reason for it was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.090" offset="6499767">The development of corporate employers, the employer could not be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.024" offset="6527457">He could not prove negligence because he had to overcome the three common law defenses, of contributory negligence, assumption of risk and fellow-servant doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.336" offset="6572701">Secondly, the reason for this statue was that the expense of litigation and the time involved prevented the employee from pursuing his claim, therefore compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.274" offset="6628498">What did compensation do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.432" offset="6637066">Immediately it eliminated the concept of negligence entirely with reference to work connected injuries and substituted a system of showing work connection only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.724" offset="6682311">The question of negligence did not, was not involved then as between an employer and an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.647" offset="6710000">The second thing that the compensation did was to provide a hearing before an administrative agency as opposed to the court and a jury, again for the purpose of providing a prompt, a final, and an inexpensive determination of the liability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.041" offset="6795577">With that purpose in mind we suggest to the Court that the compensation system can be preserved only by strict application of the doctrine of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.237" offset="6844270">If that is not done then in any industrial injury claim, you can have repeated trials on the question of work connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.843" offset="6878751">The employer can defend a case first of all on the ground that the relationship didn't exist then they could have no trial according to petitioner's theory on the question of whether there was an accident then possibly another trial on whether or not the condition preexisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.150" offset="6936012">And after all of those trials at the administrative level then we can still take Section 21 and appeal it through the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.993" offset="6963388">If res judicata is not applied then the primary purpose of compensation system would be destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.779" offset="13026513">In our case that's the one thing he wasn't asked to do.</text>
