            <text syncTime="24.143" offset="199973">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.016" offset="219408">This is case is here on certiorari to the Third Circuit which denied enforcement of the Board's order directed for the respondent Shipbuilding Workers Union and its local 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.058" offset="279594">The basic question is whether a Union violates Section 8 (b) 1 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act a disciplining a member for filing an unfair labor practice charge against the Union with the National Labor Relations Board before he's exhausted internal Union procedures for the resolution of his dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.364" offset="396831">Now the basic facts are these, early in 1964, Edward -- Edwin Holder a member of local 22 and employed by the United States Lines Company is a ship painter filed charges with the local accusing its president of conduct violative of the International Union's Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.901" offset="515009">When the locals trial board determined that the president was not guilty of the charges Holder went out pursuing his intra union procedures the International's constitution provided for appeals to the general membership of the local and then to the general executive board of the International and finally to the national convention filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board covering the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.284" offset="644472">He filed two charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.565" offset="649592">He filed one against the union alleging that the union had cause United States Lines to discriminate against him in employment because of his concerted a activities and violation of Sections 8 (b) (2) and 8 (b) (1) (a) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.310" offset="728586">He filed a companion charge against the company United States Line alleging that the company had discriminated against him because of his union activity in violation of Sections 8 (a) (1) and 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.864" offset="802879">After filing of these charges which I might say upon investigation why the board's general director would dismiss for lack of evidence, the Union accused Holder of violating the provision of the Union constitution which provided that every member shall exhaust all remedies and appeals within the Union before he shall resort to any court or other tribunal outside of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.343" offset="948746">He was found guilty of having violated this provision by filing his charges with the National Labor Relations Board and was expelled from Union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.036" offset="995558">Holder thereupon filed another charge with the National Labor Relations Board which forms the basis for this proceeding alleging that the Union by expelling him for having filed his first charge with the Board violated Section 8 (b) (1) (a) of the act which I will get to it in a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.963" offset="1083225">Is it clear Mr. Come that nothing affected his employment, nothing in this case affected his employment relationship with US Lines?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="251.655" stopTime="467.110">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="251.655" offset="1109974">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.019" offset="1119483">There's no dispute that his employment was not affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.159" offset="1139963">The Board applying its current decision, in which it had held that a Union had violated Section 8 (b) (1) (a) by fining a member who had filed charges against the Board found that the Union here had violated Section 8 (b) (1) (a) and entered in appropriate remedial order.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.707" offset="1230242">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit set aside the Board's order, its decision is in conflict with what the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia did in the Roberts case upholding the a comparable board order.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.594" offset="1305788">Now, Section 8 (b) (1) (a) which this Court is well familiar with provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to restraint or coerce employees and the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.852" offset="1386768">I might say that the statutory provisions are set forth that beginning pages 39 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.824" offset="1426683">Now, there's a proviso to Section 8 (b) (1) (a) that says that this paragraph shall not impair the right of a labor organization to proscribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.358" offset="1496795">Now, I wish to acknowledge at the outset that I've got a problem with this proviso and I have a further problem with this Court's decision in Allis-Chalmers on the last term which I hope I can overcome but before I get to that I would just like to deal momentarily with the subsidiary contention that there's no in permanent of Section 7 right here to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.949" offset="1619153">Now, I think that the Courts have pretty clearly establish and even the court below acknowledges that the right to file a charge with the National Labor Relations Board even though it is not specifically enumerated in Section 7 of the Act is included in thereby necessary implication for the simple reason and as this Court has recognized only most recently early this time in the Nash case.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.612" offset="1765857">The Board can only act on a charges file and therefore as a necessary precondition of vindicating all the other rights they are specifically enumerated in Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.179" offset="1820087">There must be the right to file a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.101" offset="1839731">Secondly, I think that it is also well settled that a charge since it merely sets in the motion, the Board machinery doesn't have to have the specificity of a formal plea and that the charge here although the court below seem to think to the contrary was certainly specific enough to show that Holder was complaining of a violation of a Section 7 rights so that I think that --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="467.110" offset="1971806">Section 7 protects only concerted activities, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="471.189" stopTime="475.812">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="471.189" offset="1988106">Well, that -- that contention is raised by the Union and I think that that is --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="475.812" stopTime="479.092">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="475.812" offset="2006601">But that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.836" offset="2010676">I mean in -- that's what its language says, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="479.092" stopTime="567.439">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="479.092" offset="2019767">Well, it says the employee shall have a right to self organization before him join or resist labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.393" offset="2048920">The bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection and shall also have the right to refrain from any all such activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.468" offset="2113285">Now, there is no question that an individual has a right to complain of Union activity that interferes with his right to refrain from engaging in union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.646" offset="2213909">I mean, it doesn't have to be concerted in the sense that it's a grievance that he's alleging not only for himself but for other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.574" offset="2261661">Now, what Holder was complaining about here was that the Union was discriminating or causing the employer to discriminate against him and to prior of employment opportunities because of position that he had either taken or failed to take with regard to the Union.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="567.439" stopTime="589.909">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="567.439" offset="2373151">There was no question about that so far as the act is concern that an individual employee has a right to be a charging party to file a charge under Section -- of an unfair labor practice but the question is whether or not that particular right is one of the rights protected Section 7 of the Act and you -- it has to be in order for you to prevail, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="589.909" stopTime="1194.140">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="589.909" offset="2463013">Yes, but all I'm saying is that the kind of complaint that Holder may is the garden variety kind of complaint if there were merit to it that would be found to violate 8 (b) (2) if you could prove that the union was discriminating against him for the reason that he alleged or that the company was violating 8 (a) (3) if the act we asked in the union's causing the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.956" offset="2595192">Secondly, there's also a matter as to whether or not the union had failed to process a grievance alleging this problem in good faith which could raise a problem as to whether there was a duty of the union's violations of the duties of the union's duty fair representation which will give you in 8 (b) (1) (a) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.032" offset="2715460">All I'm saying is that although there may be situations at the periphery as to whether the filing of a charge is a Section 7 activity or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.560" offset="2765615">The sort of thing that Holder was complaining of here if the evidence sustained his contention what have been clear violations of the statue and I think that that is all that we have to show to get in the ball park here.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.376" offset="2836877">Now, I'd like to turn to the one other thing under Section 7 and to put and that is that if the individual is protected in his right to file a charge he has the right to file the charge under the act is promptly as possible as this Court pointed out in a decision earlier this term there is no requirement in the National Labor Relations Act for the exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.091" offset="2979715">It's a matter of fact, Section 10 (a) of the Act says that the board's power shall not be affected by any other private means of adjustment and Section 10 (b) of the Act which sets a six months statute of limitations period indeed encourages a prompt filing of charges so that we start then at least in our view of it with a situation where the union by expelling Holder for filing charges with the board promptly without exhausting his internal union remedy in a very real sense has restraint or coerced him in a exercising freely the right that Section 7 would give him the file such a charge promptly irrespective of whether an investigation it prove to have merit as long at least is there was no showing that he acted in bad faith and there is none here.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.003" offset="3235401">So, then we come to the problem as to whether or not this restraint or coercion is legal restraint or coercion and that brings us to the proviso of the 8 (b) (1) (a) and to this Court's decision in the Allis-Chalmers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.513" offset="3305409">Now, for the union this is a very easy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.059" offset="3323591">They read the terms of the proviso and they say that this exhaustion requirement was a membership requirement which Holder a great too when he joined the union by violating this membership requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.169" offset="3396002">The union had disciplined and that ends the ball game for them because they apply the plain meaning rule and they say how plainer can you get something that fits within the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.095" offset="3455770">Now, I admit that that is a persuasive argument however, this Court has often times cautioned that a plain meaning rule particularly with respect to Section 8 (b) (1) (a) is not a very reliable guide as to the reach of the provision but you have to look at the statute in the light of its legislative history and even more importantly in the light of the other provisions of the statute because Congress in enacting Section 8 (b) (1) (a) was trying to fit it into a unified statutory pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.726" offset="3626297">Now, when we look at the unified statutory pattern, what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="885.933" offset="3647091">Well, we find first of all as I've indicated that under Section 10 (b) of the Act the board cannot act unless a charge is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.498" offset="3693380">You look at the employer's side of the picture and you find that employer coercion in respect to the filing of charges is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.563" offset="3729638">It's not only prohibited it's specifically under Section 8 (a) (4) but it has been held even by the court below that such employer coercion is been held to violate the general terms of Section 8 (a) (1) of the statute which bars employer in general terms restraint coercion and the exercise of Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.298" offset="3844577">Now, looking at those provisions this Court in the Nash case earlier this term said this indicates that Congress intended that an individual would be free of all coercion in respect to the filing of unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.533" offset="3941543">As a matter of fact the Court said, employer and union coercion and referred to the Roberts case, Nash to be sure that not involve a union coercion and involved the question as to whether or not State of Florida's policy of denying an individual unemployment compensation because he had filed charges was in conflict with the scheme of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.421" offset="4065050">So then we say in the light of this statutory pattern it is reasonable for the board to read the general restraint and coercion terms of Section 8 (b) (1) (a) as affording the same protection against union coercion in respect for the filing of charges that 8 (a) (1) of the Act provides against employer coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.062" offset="4195662">Now, in the Allis-Chalmers case which was decided last term this Court held that Section 8 (b) (1) (a) did not bar a union from finding those of its members who refused to heed the union's strike ball and seeking to collect those fines by state court suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.637" offset="4305899">Now, in reaching that conclusion the Court relied upon two principle things as I read the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.119" offset="4343829">One, that the right to strike was an important weapon in the union's economic arsenal and unless it had a power to find strike breakers, the right to strike would be substantially impaired and secondly, that as the Court read the legislative history of Section 8 (b) (1) (a) and its proviso it indicated that Congress did not propose any limitation with respect to the internal affairs of a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.495" offset="4513311">Now, I should point out that as the Court is well aware that Allis-Chalmers was a five to four decision and Mr. Justice White in his concurring opinion indicated that he did not read the majority opinion as privileging any union rule no matter how unreasonable or unenforceable on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.338" offset="4644760">It appeared to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.384" offset="4652910">Now, apart from that however we submit that as Mr.-- as Judge Fay pointed out for the Court of Appeals in the Roberts case that a union rule that would penalize employees for filing charges with the board goes beyond the area of internal union affairs that Congress was concerned about in enacting the -- and in providing an exemption under Section 8 (b) (1) (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.143" offset="4835976">As Judge Fay put it such a rule goes beyond the internal affairs of the union and into the public domain --</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.727" offset="7090239">There's a well recognized principle of judicial administration that in these union's suits that says when a union comes to a court, the court if it is persuaded that it has an adequate union remedy will stay its hand and remit -- may I just finish my argue -- will remit the individual to his union tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.861" offset="7210820">We say that that is a far cry from a union sanction because there the individual has a chance to go to an impartial tribunal for the impartial tribunal to make a judgment to whether the union procedure is in fact adequate and then can remit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.021" offset="7287411">If on the other hand the tribunal is satisfied at the procedure is inadequate, it can give the member immediate relief without requiring the member to guess is to whether or not he has got a situation that can wait or can't wait if he guesses wrong union discipline sticks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.973" offset="7579251">I should also like to say that insofar as the board argues public policy here I think we have two considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.384" offset="7624913">First, even if you call expulsion from a union restraint or coercion and the sense in which those were to use in Section 8 (b) (1) (a) you do not in this case have that restraint or coercion used to blank completely or to punish for entry into the board's processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.523" offset="7761481">You have it only as a rule which under the statute can delay and by the statute, I'm referring to the Landrum-Griffin Act, I think Section 101 (a) (4) can delay access to the board for four months at the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.683" offset="7834102">And the second place the Congress has already adopted a public policy on this matter, not withstanding all of the scholarly attempts to split hairs about whom the proviso on Section 101 (a) (4) of the Landrum Griffin Act applies to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.587" offset="7917693">It is perfectly clear is set forth in the opinion of the court below and it is set forth in our briefs that the best reasoning is that the public policy would permit a union itself or a court or a board to impose only a four-month delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.290" offset="8016541">With these preliminary attempts to answer only one or two of the statements made my Brother, I should like to say that to me the most stricken aspect of this case is that the board under the guide of interpreting Section 8 (b) (1) (a) has in effect legislature that a new unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.386" offset="8132942">I say this because the pertinent statutes and their legislative history as well as this Court's opinion last term, the Allis-Chalmers case, make it so eminently clear that the union conduct which the Board in this case condemns is not violative of Section 8 (b) (1) (a) and I believe that my statement is warranted in addition by the fact that this evidence is such clear and preponderant proof that such conduct is not an unfair labor practice that for 17 years the board its general counsel and the courts uniformly so held indeed only a few months before the board decided the Pre LaGuardia case namely the Scura case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.838" offset="8390719">The board stated after reviewing the relevant legislative history that it had not been empowered by Congress to police a union decision that a member is or is not in good standing or to pass judgment on the penalties a union may impose on a member so long as the penalty does not impair the member status as an employee and it is to be remember that this case as Mr. Come admits for the board Mr. Holder's status as an employee was not changed one wit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.140" offset="10083976">Section 8 (a) (4) of the Act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer if this retry is all upon an employee because that employee has filed a charges on to the Act it would seem perfectly simply possibly too simple logic to say that had Congress intended in 1949 when that added at Section 8 (b) the list of union unfair labor practices to the Wagner Act to proscribe similar in action by union in a clear statement of that effect in Section 8 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.300" offset="10256593">Indeed, the House in passing the Taft-Hartley Act included in it a Section 8 (c) (5) which did make it an unfair labor practice for a union to find or penalize any member because he may charges for instituted proceedings against the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2575.857" offset="10406849">So but as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out there is no provision in Section 8 (b) with respect to unions that is cognate to Section 8 (a) (4) with respect to employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.937" offset="10471111">The second piece of evidence because of the absence of such a specific provision in Section B, the board seeks to use Section 8 (b) (1) (a) as a substitute net in which to catch its fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.014" offset="10551463">The volley of Section makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain and to coerce employees and the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7.</text>
