            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="44.461" offset="282290">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.692" offset="299112">This is a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.272" offset="317503">It raises the question of the constitutional validity of an amendment which Congress passed in August 1965 to the Universal Military Training and Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.373" offset="389914">The nature of the statutory provision involved can best be seen at page 3 of the Government's brief in this case which sets out that Section 12 (b) of what is often called the Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.007" offset="484373">That is the general criminal provision of the Selective Service Act, making a large number of specified actions subject to criminal penalty and I would call the Court's attention first at paragraph 6 at the bottom of page 3, the Section begins: “Any person” in (6), “who annoyingly violates or evades any of the provision of this Title or rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, relating to the issuance, transfer or possession of such certificate shall upon conviction” and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.325" offset="673708">Then, I would refer the Court to paragraph 3 at the middle of page 3, which is the paragraph directly involved in this case, until 1965 it contained the words which are not printed in italics, making it a crime for any person to forge, alter or in any manner change any such certificate and what Congress did in 1965 was to add the forewords which are printed in italics, “knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates”.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.477" offset="862312">The case was tried in the District Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts in June 1966 before Judge Sweeney in a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.576" offset="914662">I would bring to the Court's attention the fact that the defendant had no counsel at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.039" offset="948517">This was his own choice and Judge Sweeney took pains to see that he was advised as to his rights or that he understood his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.121" offset="996895">In this connection, it should also be observed that he had counsel at his arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.685" offset="1027093">That an appearance was entered for him; that he obviously had counsel in preparing a motion to dismiss which he filed on constitutional grounds and that he has the help of counsel in this Court as he had in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.087" offset="1132732">The evidence at the trial was not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.170" offset="1153108">It showed that the defendant and three others burned small white cards on the steps of the South Boston Courthouse on March 31, 1966 in the presence of a sizable crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.741" offset="1219354">Four photographs of this event were introduced into evidence and they appear at pages 48 to 51 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.803" offset="1275570">Photographs of the remnant of the draft card itself were also received in evidence and can be found on pages 52 and 53 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.420" offset="1334084">Immediately after the event and after he had been advised of his right to remain silent and to have counsel, the defendant told an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and this is on page 11 of the record: “I asked him what he had done, what he had burned”, said the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.905" offset="1440037">“He told me that he had burned a Selective Service Certificate and that he knew it was a violation of federal law but that he had his own beliefs and his own philosophies why he did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.010" offset="1492386">And he produced the charred remains of the Selective Service Certificate which he showed me and it was in an envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.486" offset="1526345">I asked him if it is alright if I photographed it and he said it was perfectly alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.936" offset="1548184">And I called in Special Agent Burnt who was with me and we photographed the remains”.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.411" offset="1582038">The defendant did not testify nor call any witnesses but he did make an argument to the jury at -- during which he stated, and this is on page 29 of the record and, “I don't contest the fact that I did burn my draft card because I did”.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.001" offset="1700425">The jury returned the verdict of guilty and after a careful consideration which is fully disclosed on the record, Judge Sweeney sentenced the defendant under the Youth Correction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.426" offset="1770120">In the defendant's brief, this is referred to as a six-year maximum indeterminate sentence and in a very real sense it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.435" offset="1822156">But it is also quite different from an ordinary sentence because it can be much shorter than the maximum and it can be terminated in such a way as to leave the defendant with no criminal record.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.835" offset="1951723">When the case went to the United States' Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that Court in an opinion by Judge Aldrich held that the 1965 Amendment which made draft card burning specifically an offense was unconstitutional as a suppression of symbolic speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.017" offset="2052451">Having reached the result of unconstitutionality however, Judge Aldrich then exercised the certain measure of what might be called Yankee ingenuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.899" offset="2103965">He held that the judgment of conviction should nevertheless be sustained because the facts necessarily prove to support the draft card burning charge inevitably clude -- included proof of a related offense, namely, not being in possession of a draft card as required by the Selective Service Regulations and made an offense under paragraph 6 of the statute to which I've already referred.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.391" offset="2269999">I would support the result on a slightly different verbal formulation that it was an offense the facts of which were proved and the fact that the Government appeared to proceed under a different clause of the statute didn't negative the validity of the conviction when the facts proved showed a violation of Section 6 even though Section 3 was out.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.642" offset="3798998">That's certainly is the primary question to which I will now turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.986" offset="3832330">On the Government's petition, No. 232, there is only a question of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.803" offset="3859602">There's no question of the construction of the statute, no question as to the effect or the weight of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.410" offset="3886038">The facts are clear and as I've indicated in effect admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.515" offset="3914459">On its face, there can be no constitutional question about the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.074" offset="3944657">It forbids the doing of an act: knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.607" offset="3978825">The contention is made, however, that in the circumstances of this case the act constitutes symbolic speech and that Congress cannot proscribe it because that would violate the First Amendment's provision of laws abridging the freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.185" offset="4069104">Of course, it is clear that there can be symbolic speech or to put it another way that acts may be in effect a speech though they are not vocal, oral, by voice, a nod, the shake of the head, a wink, a raising of an eyebrow at an auction sale, a gesture such thumbs down may be modes of communication and one can readily think of circumstances under which Congress could not forbid them as for example on the case of an address delivered by hand signals to an audience of deaf persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.775" offset="4247468">But it does not follow from this that all acts are the equivalent of speech or that Congress cannot forbid them even though there is an element of communication in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.512" offset="4310476">I suppose that assaulting an official of the Selective Service System could be thought of as symbolic speech or breaking a window of this Court building under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.344" offset="4381738">In a sense, refusing to report for induction could be argued to be symbolic speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.621" offset="4418832">It seems equally clear that all of these acts can be made unlawful by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.115" offset="4452895">In an effort to test this problem, there is one case which this Court has considered which I think is entirely out of the emotional zone and therefore it may be of a particular use in considering this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.262" offset="4549444">This is People against Stover cited at page 18 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.828" offset="4579746">That is the case which came through the New York Court of Appeals and it involved a married couple in New Rochelle, New York who thought their taxes were too high and so they strung dirty clothes and underwear and odds and ends of unattractive things on a clothesline in front of their house and each year that they didn't get their taxes reduced, they put up another clothesline so that in time, they had six, both in the front and in the side of their yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.124" offset="4736899">And thereafter, after the clothesline were up, the City of New Rochelle passed an ordinance making it illegal to have clotheslines on the front or side of a house abutting the street with certain exceptions in cases of necessity and the defendants in that case did not claim the necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.459" offset="4846195">They were then prosecuted under this City Ordinance and were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.194" offset="4869183">They took their case to the New York Court of Appeals where it was very carefully considered in an opinion by then Judge Fuld, who considered expressly the First Amendment argument that this putting up of the clothesline was symbolic speech intended to show their opposition to the local government and the conviction was affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.658" offset="4999064">And then not content with that, the parties filed an appeal to this Court and in 375 U.S., this Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that there was no substantial federal question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.630" offset="5962877">I suppose that the fact that it is such a symbol as what makes it attracted to burning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1570.937" offset="6388151">However, when this is examined, it is not a hearing in the usual sense and that there were no outside witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1881.707" offset="7631266">It is dealt with at length in the Second Circuit's opinion in United States against Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.625" offset="7658851">Particularly at the bottom of page 80 and 81 of that opinion where a considerable number of ways in which the draft card can be useful in the administration of the system are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.987" offset="7732308">And I don't know of any place where that this is more fully or comprehensively stated than in that opinion of the Second Circuit and I surely intend to rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.282" offset="7785493">To begin with, the Court says the notice of classification serves as proof of registration and it also contains complete information as to a registrant's classification including the type and date thereof and the period for which it is effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2001.428" offset="8110143">The suggestion is made in a defendant's brief; that this statute labors under some sort of infirmity because Congress passed it on its own initiative and without any prodding from the Selective Service System or other officers of the executive branch of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.206" offset="8181196">This seems a rather noble point where usually told that the executive interferes to much in the workings of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.350" offset="8209826">That Congress should itself determine what are to be the laws of the lands should need no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.412" offset="8234068">Certainly, it is not a basis for showing that the statute passed by Congress is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.236" offset="8261339">Congress did not forbid dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.273" offset="8273460">It could not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.682" offset="8283073">O'Brien was free at all times to express dissent by speech from the courthouse steps or on the street corners, by letters to the editor, by pamphlet, by radio and television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.067" offset="8332706">This case does not involve a question of the line between a speech and no speech where the answer would be clear in favor of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.645" offset="8375024">For the contention of the defendant is not that he can speak which of course he can but rather that he can do acts despite the fact that they had been forbidden by that formal action of the representatives of the people in Congress assembled which we call a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.002" offset="8444406">Of course, a statute must comply with the terms of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.717" offset="8463214">This one, we submit does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.710" offset="8475230">In terms it forbids an act clearly and specifically so that there's no question of over breadth or vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.089" offset="8512742">The defendant knew exactly what was forbidden and what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.637" offset="8530923">What he did clearly constituted an interference with the effective operation of the Selective Service System and Congress as the legislative arm of the Government, acting according to its judgment determined that this should be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.376" offset="8593930">Since there was no real impairment of any right to speak and since adequate other avenues of communication were always open to the defendant, the contention of the defendants' action was symbolic speech should not take away from Congress the power to do what it regarded as necessary and proper in order to carry out its power granted by the constitution to raise and support armies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.312" offset="8733633">As this Court said in the Giboney against the Empire Storage Company case, it is never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech suppressed to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced or carried out by means of language either spoken, written or printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.410" offset="8838019">One other point is made by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.001" offset="8848363">He says that since non-possession of a draft card was already forbidden, it follows that when Congress forbad draft card burning, the only purpose in effect to the statute was to abridge symbolic speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.040" offset="8908549">It is true that Congress from the beginning of the draft laws and specifically in the Universal Military Training and Service Act passed in 1948 has made it a crime knowingly to violate rules and regulations promulgated under the statute relating to the issuance, transfer or possession of certificates under the draft law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.927" offset="9012099">Either or both the Registration Certification and the Classification Certificate are generally lumped together in the term “draft cards”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.615" offset="9050864">Regulations under the Act have long provided that a registrant must have in his personal possession at all times his Registration Certificate and his Notice of Classification if he has been classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.681" offset="9111155">Again, it is odd that Congress should be regarded as under a disability because it has shown to -- chosen to put into a statute something which is closely related to a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.921" offset="9164131">Some might think it better for the law to be stated in what Congress has itself written rather than by delegated executive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.281" offset="9213555">Moreover, the regulation could be changed by the executive branch of the Government and might be subject to attack on grounds of construction, or vagueness, or a lack of validly delegated authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.463" offset="9286280">The statute is clear and specific and subject to change only by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.203" offset="9317209">It should surely spend no lower constitutionally or otherwise because it was preceded and is today accompanied by a closely related regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.765" offset="9371439">The statutes on the regulation are not coextensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.144" offset="9392964">The regulation deals with what might be called a status of non-possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.062" offset="9420654">It might apply, for example to a man who lost his draft card and then deliberately and willfully did not seek a replacement while the statute pinpoints a particular Act, which results in loss of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.128" offset="9500902">For these reasons, we submit that the statute enacted by Congress is constitutional.Application of the statute does not hinder protected methods of protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.244" offset="9557326">On its face, the law forbids an act and represents a reasonable judgment by Congress, that one who either knowingly destroys or knowingly mutilates a draft card does an act which impairs the effective functioning of the Selective Service System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.095" offset="9640814">That legislative determination, we submit, should be deemed to fall within the bounds of congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.391" offset="9685953">I now turn to the question raised in Number 233, which is the defendant's position as I've already pointed out it need not be reached if our contention as to constitutionality is maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.463" offset="9762231">This is a question whether the conviction can be sustained even though the Amendment to clause 3 of the statute is invalid because it amounts to a charge of a non-possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.010" offset="9828477">As I've said, Judge Aldrich said that this was a lesser included offense, we would differ verbally with this and the offense of non-possession is not a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.369" offset="9889917">It's an offense under the same section of the statute and subject to the same penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.317" offset="9913637">We would suggest the conclusion, we would support the conclusion of the judge on the ground that the facts alleged were sufficient to embrace the offense of non-possession; that the facts proved clearly showed non-possession and that there is no unfairness to the defendant in this as he was in no sense taken by surprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.658" offset="13559077">Well, let me address myself at this point then, Mr. Justice Fortas to the various suggestions which have been made on the part of the Government in this Court and in other courts and by the learned Solicitor General that this is a proper indication of the power to raise armies because it serves some role in the Selective Service -- in the administration of Selective Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.577" offset="13654685">Now I believe I count to three or four occasions when the Solicitor General repeated that this serves a valid selective service -- a valid function but all that he stated was referring to the Second Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.121" offset="13704840">Now, I believe that if we outlined all of the rationales which are presented in the Second Circuit's opinion as well as those in the brief presented by the Government, we are left with no more than the possibility that the certificate may serve some notice giving or identification purpose exclusively for the benefit of the registrant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.019" offset="13812464">And that only under the most remote possible conditions can it be suggested that it serves some function for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.465" offset="13842244">It is well-known that the Selective Service System keeps elaborate records at its national headquarters and emergency records of other kinds as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.280" offset="13873486">Now, I suggest that perhaps the reason why the Solicitor General was not more explicit in stating these reasons is that some of them are so fanciful as perhaps not to be worthy of mention in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.387" offset="13933986">And I noticed that two of those which have been suggested in the lower courts have not been suggested in this Court, namely that in the even of an earthquake, disaster or other flood why -- or something of a nature of a flood, it would be possible for -- there'd be a quick reconstruction of the records if all men would be ordered to report to a certain place by radio or television.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.522" offset="14014443">And the final suggestion which was made in the arguments below but thankfully not in this Court was that in the even of an enemy missile attack and a call by radio why persons could be ordered to report to certain places in accordance with their draft classifications and that would serve a valid governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.599" offset="14074838">The only other purpose, which it was suggested is served is that when the registrant to his local board, in the event he may have forgotten his number or forgotten the address of his board while it may assist in this identification if he has the card in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.788" offset="14127501">Now, it seems to me that if that is all that the Government can offer in support of this, it is a very, very light balance indeed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4347.563" offset="17494685">Again, what the legislature of Alabama as distinguished from its members intended on this Court and what the purpose on this Court of the legislature as distinguished from its members was in the enactment of this law is that a traditional matter well concern to the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.044" offset="17552572">Now, the best cases that I can cite, decisions by this Court is the case of Grosjean and the case of Gomillion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.089" offset="17584755">Now in Grosjean, Mr. Justice Sutherland writing for the Court spoke of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.347" offset="17601787">He spoke both of the history of this type of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.518" offset="17614430">This if I may refresh the recollection of all of us was the Newspaper Tax Law enacted by the Huey Long Administration in the State of Louisiana in the 30's which had the clear effect of discriminating against the large city newspapers in favor of the smaller rural newspapers with obvious political consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.172" offset="17685065">And, Mr. Justice Sutherland spoke both of the history of this type of legislation and also the setting in which it was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.207" offset="17725189">Now, it seems to me that that Court looked at the setting in 1930 in the Grosjean case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.688" offset="17747132">The Fifth Circuit looked at the setting in which some of these statutes were passed in the Petty case and then in the Gomillion case and I respectfully suggest that this Court should not be and will not be, as Mr. Chief Justice Taft observed in another context, too blind to see what all others can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.481" offset="17826335">The setting and the purpose of this law, when it was passed by Congress and the legislative history makes it abundantly clear that it had only one purpose in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.717" offset="17863220">Nobody was concerned with anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.610" offset="17874819">All of that is subsequent rationalizations, subsequent papering is over by able attorneys for the Government at various levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.071" offset="17904703">The First Circuit saw that there was no rationale legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.298" offset="17921630">They cited Grosjean and Gomillion but they didn't comment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.161" offset="17933019">They say, “We won't comment on the purpose on whether it was legitimate or illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.672" offset="17951096">We won't say whether it was illegitimate because we find it serves no legitimate purpose”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.304" offset="17969591">And it seems to me that a reading of the entire reading of the entire legislative history would make this clear.</text>
