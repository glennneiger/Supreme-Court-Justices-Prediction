            <label>Mr. Robert F. Rolnick</label>
            <text syncTime="21.019" offset="187434">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.449" offset="213138">At the time of the recess yesterday, I was at the point where I had described how the respondents had originated their franchise program and formulated a franchise agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.108" offset="271757">Pursuant to the terms of which, franchisees were required to maintain resale prices, purchased type products, deal exclusively with the franchisor and indeed it also provided that they were subject to certain other territorial restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.324" offset="356707">These provisions were backed up by a 30-day cancellation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.966" offset="407280">During the life of the franchisers in question, the franchisor enforced the terms of these agreements rigorously.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.110" offset="455764">The details of that enforcement are set forth in our appendix beginning at page 175.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.173" offset="496097">Indeed, the enforcement was so rigorous that the respondents terminated one of the petitioners herein after a series of warnings to him that he was not purchasing tail pipes, exhaust pipes and clamps which they sold from Midas, but was rather -- was instead purchasing them from competitors who offered these parts for sale and prices which were substantially below the prices at which respondent sold these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.799" offset="634546">Indeed, during the course of those warnings, there was a colloquy between one of the principal officers of the respondents and this petitioner in which the principal officer said, “You know, your franchise is like a marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.974" offset="711241">This is like cheating on your wife and it is grounds for divorce,” referring to the fact that he had purchase from outside sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.643" offset="757948">Following this termination, this petitioner, joined by the three other petitioners, initiated this action under Section 4 of the Clayton Act in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois, Northern Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.693" offset="830151">In that action, the petitioners alleged that they were injured as a result of having been compelled to adhere and adhere strictly to the restrictive provisions in these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.329" offset="896711">They alleged that these restrictive provisions represented violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.876" offset="950836">We submit that it was the plainest kind of error for the District Court to dismiss on a motion for summary judgment, this action which had been brought by these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.446" offset="1025128">The District Court applied the doctrine of in pari delicto, the doctrine that these petitioners were at equal fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.034" offset="1079463">We believe that under the circumstances of this case, the in pari delicto doctrine is not applicable and indeed, we submit that the in pari delicto doctrine is not applicable to any action brought under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.456" offset="1173191">The doctrine is not applicable to the facts in this case when it is examined in light of the restrictions which the respondents imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.300" offset="1224600">These restrictions were of no benefit to the respondents -- to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.510" offset="1245393">They were in fact of sole benefit, sole and exclusive benefit to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.066" offset="1279666">It is difficult to imagine for example how the petitioners could have profited or benefited from the fact that they were forced, forced to pay more for parts which they purchased from the respondents and they would have paid -- had they purchased these parts from respondents competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.451" offset="1473181">On the other hand, in meeting out the territories, what the respondents did was limit the area within which the petitioner could sell this Midas muffler.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.359" offset="1548831">Now, one has to remember that these Midas mufflers were purchased by the petitioner and that this limitation on territory represented an alienation on the restraint -- an alienation restraining the territory within which these petitioners could sell merchandise which they had in fact purchased and paid for.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="387.216" offset="1652276">So it goes the alleged antitrust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.050" offset="1659591">I was simply directing myself to your statement that none of these things were of any benefit to the petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.757" offset="1682369">The purchase of the muffler was a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.921" offset="1703058">The right to sell the muffler was a benefit and I believe that was independent of the territorial restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.232" offset="1732315">It was the muffler which we chose to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.697" offset="1742137">It was the muffler which carry with it the national advertising and the consumer demand which in fact made it pre-sold and it was this that we chose to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.056" offset="1787591">The territory happened to be something which was of benefit to the respondents because they limited the area, and by limiting the area could presumably have more franchisees.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.468" offset="1925204">The profit was derived independently of the restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.532" offset="1949550">The profit did not arise out of the restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.532" offset="1961462">The profit arose exclusively out of the sale of the Midas muffler which is I say, carried a very unique guarantee and a vast amount of national advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.729" offset="7222314">There’s too much power in the hands of Union Oil and the Court rightly said there that this implied a certain lack of freedom to deal on the part of the dealer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.750" offset="7922395">It is not much different from the situation which the Court faced in United States versus General Motors in the Los Angeles situation where there, it was the dealers who initiated the Boycott against the sales to discounters and the Court there said that this amounted to a horizontal conspiracy among the dealers and the company so that if you followed it to its logical conclusion, General Motors would be able to sue the dealers for that violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.881" offset="8782869">Denying the defense will encourage them to remain in these illegal arrangements and to enter into them in the expectation that if the thing doesn’t work out, they might secure treble damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2427.956" offset="9815228">In 1955, Midas’ total sales or international parts total sales, not just Midas sales were some $5 million which means that most we were around 3% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.010" offset="9871444">His complaint alleges that we tripled our sales from 1955 to the time that this case was decided and I also think that it’s important that that case refers to the fact that the manufacturers of passenger automobile such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Studebaker are in this business, are particularly in the installation business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.648" offset="9973948">And although it doesn’t reveal any figures in that complaint for what they have sold or what their dealers sold, saying that they get their mufflers from some of Midas’ competitors, I think that the fact that these large companies are in this business, makes clear that what we’re trying to do is enable ourselves to compete with this new concept and with this new idea.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.629" offset="11449866">And the complaint there reads, paragraph 14 and I think it’s plain from the complaint what the scope of the market is, “The Gorlick group is the largest supplier of automotive exhaust systems and parts for the replacement trade accounting from more than 42% of a total dollar volume of such manufacture and sale in 1959.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.206" offset="11536175">I want to point out that the comparison of Mr. McGee made was between 1959 sales or $160 million in 1955 sales of $5 million when an accurate comparison should be a $160 million in 1959 against $17 million by the respondents, which makes approximately 11% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.074" offset="11623633">During the same year, Walker Manufacturing Company, Meremade Automotive and International Parts Corporation, accounted for approximately 22%, 13% and 11% respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.050" offset="11675564">Approximately 95% of Orban industries exhaust systems and parts sold for the replacement trade in that year were sold by Orban to automobile manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.083" offset="11727705">And I submit that on the basis of that complaint where the government carefully showed the sales to automotive manufacturers that this encompasses the entire market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.929" offset="11807117">Simpson versus Union Oil which was referred to is directly applicable to the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.100" offset="11851734">In that case, this Court said that a franchisee had standing to sue.</text>
