            <label>Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="107.246" offset="534403">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.556" offset="563660">I appear here on behalf of the petitioner and whose favor Your Honors granted certiorari to the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.449" offset="607232">In this case here, the petitioner stands convicted by jury in Cook County, Illinois of the murder of a policeman and the fixing by that jury of the penalty of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.359" offset="682883">The case as I said comes of the Court by certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois which unanimously on writ of error in a post-conviction proceeding rejected the position of the petitioner which I have the privilege of presenting to Your Honors today and affirm the dismissal of the post-conviction petition which we filed myself, my partner Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Solovy in behalf of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.928" offset="841080">Your Honors, limited the grant of certiorari to the following question, whether the operation of the Illinois statute providing that in a murder case, the state could challenge for a cause all prospective jurors who were opposed to or had conscientious scruples against capital punishment, deprived the petitioner of a jury which fairly represented a cross section of the community and interpolating in that scope of venireman were arbitrarily and systematically disqualified and excluded for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.712" offset="1044313">And did this assure the state of a jury whose members were partial to the prosecution on the issue of guilt or innocence and I interpolate in that only none scope of venireman where judge qualified to serve all these in violation of the petitioners' rights to a fair and impartial jury out of the Sixth Amendment, to due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.537" offset="1215572">Because in some aspects of the issues or sub-issues that are raised here, the course of these proceedings appeal wise and convict -- post-conviction wise will have I respectfully suggest that will appear some vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.766" offset="1292476">I will take a minute or two to indicate the post-conviction course of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.191" offset="1334168">The petitioner was indicted in October of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.153" offset="1357991">He elected on his trial to be tried by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.328" offset="1386726">He is an indigent that has been indigent throughout and has been a representative throughout these proceedings by court appointed counsel several successively in some respects having an effect upon his ability to preside this matter eventually to Your Honors in a posture which would have enable him possibly to avoid some of the problems here particularly that of possible retroactive application of Your Honor's decision if Your Honors hold -- uphold the position of the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.853" offset="1564881">As I say, he was represented by a court appointed counsel on his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.546" offset="1587555">When that trial was completed, that court appointed counsel withdrew, new court appointed counsel at the suggestion of the defense of prisoner's committee of the Chicago Bar Association took -- came into the case and appeal to the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.923" offset="1681074">On that appeal, the appellant was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.675" offset="1696120">The Court appointed counsel again withdrew.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.533" offset="1711585">The permission sought from this Court, the appointment of counsel to draft and prepare and submit to the Court a petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.508" offset="1751500">And this Court quite properly advised the petitioner that it did not appoint counsel to prepare petitions for presentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.569" offset="1787653">The petitioner then went back to the Supreme Court of Illinois and the Supreme Court of Illinois did appoint counsel but by that time, the period for the filing of petition for writ of certiorari had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.344" offset="1838749">That counsel, however, in his behalf because of the appointment of the Supreme Court of Illinois continued in the case and he filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.761" offset="1912414">That was dismissed on the ground of failure to exhaust state court remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.084" offset="1933730">He then filed an Illinois post-conviction hearing proceeding under the Illinois post-conviction hearing Act with the predecessor of the Uniform Act and this was dismissed and a writ of error was denied by the Illinois Supreme Court in January 1964 with a little memorandum order not in a published opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.465" offset="2039265">He then applied for an original writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Illinois which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.735" offset="2076359">His counsel then persisting went back to the United States District Court to reinstate the habeas corpus petition in that court that had there before had been dismissed on the ground of the state court remedies had not been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.131" offset="2133932">In that proceeding before his entertained to partial that court sustained in part the petition of the petitioner primarily and not an issue before this Court that we do refer to it in a footnote on the ground of a sentencing procedure in Illinois was in another respect violation -- violated the Constitution in that if a petitioner elect to a defendant elect to be tried by jury his penalty whether death, imprisonment or otherwise under the statute was fixed by the jury without the possibility of extenuating and mitigating the circumstances being presented for the jury whereas if he pleaded guilty or if he took a trial before the Court those extenuating circumstances were permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.475" offset="2359317">They presented to the Court in the sentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.916" offset="2377080">However, on appeal to the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit, that Court reversed and the directed the dismissal of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.667" offset="2424101">At this point and certiorari was denied by Your Honor, a second habeas corpus petition was filed in the United States District Court and present counsel now appearing before Your Honors were appointed by His Honor Judge Parson as counsel for the petitioner in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.949" offset="2521172">Upon examining the record, we determine that the state court remedies we sought might not have been exhausted or we anticipated another motion to dismiss on that ground and we filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.416" offset="2603092">Another post-conviction hearing petition, stating in the petition not only categorically but by our points that we embrace every possible post-conviction procedure there might be in Illinois in this petition whether coram nobis, coram vobis, habeas corpus, the Illinois statutory post-conviction or whatever it might be, we wanted all of it, so we would avoid the technical -- possible technical defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.848" offset="2728793">We raised, if Your Honors please, for the first time in this case in that petition, the issue which is now before Your Honors and I wish frankly to state that.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.020" offset="2789501">That petition was dismissed after hearing and briefs very carefully considered and the written error was allowed by the Supreme Court of Illinois under our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.564" offset="2839656">That Court by a unanimous decision written for the court by His Honor Walter V. Schaefer, Justice Schaefer rejected the issue what is presented to Your Honors as well as other points which we raised in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.945" offset="2905172">We then filed the petition here raising many grounds but this one in particular or at least that Your Honors might have felt with particular at one you wanted to consider and you're allowed to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.537" offset="2955536">Now, that is the general background.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.617" offset="2991898">Under the Illinois law in effect, statutory law in effect at the time of the trial of this petitioner and at the time he elected to embrace his right of trial by jury under the Illinois and federal constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.449" offset="3067235">If one indicted for murder, exercise his right to trial by jury, the same jury on the issue of guilt or innocence also passes and passed upon the question of the penalty whether it would be under the statute, death, life or a term of years not less than 14 years and this was binding upon the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.142" offset="3202027">Presently since 1961, a death penalty verdict is not binding upon the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.098" offset="3229821">If there's no death penalty recommended by the jury the judge fixes the penalty at a term for a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.685" offset="7036176">But before I do that, because of the systematic exclusion claims made here, to acquaint Your Honors with at least the basics of the record with respect to the selection of the juror in this case, jurors -- the 12 -- all of the 12 jurors in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.272" offset="7126559">96 veniremen and women were questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.055" offset="7149652">The practice in Illinois is that the state questions the prospective veniremen first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.183" offset="7178177">After examining a panel of four, if acceptable to the state, the panel is then tendered to the defense and the defense questions of the panel in either challenges for cause or peremptory challenges and eventually a panel is tendered back to the state and eventually if there's an agreement on the panel of four and then we proceed to the next panel of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.034" offset="7273576">Now, here in selecting the three panels of four each, 96 prospective jurors were examined, men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.191" offset="7318194">47 of the 96 are 49% were excused for the cause simply that they responded that they had conscientious scruples or they were opposed to on some modification in language of their responses to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.134" offset="7409936">No inquiry -- no inquiry was made as to how strongly those views were held, no inquiry made as to whether the holding of the conscientious scruples would affect and to a degree would affect the best prospective jurors' judgment on these fundamental and basic issue of guilt or innocence, nor was there ever any inquiry as to whether that view so held would have an effect upon any degree thereof on the question of punishment -- death, life or imprisonment for a term exceeding 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.787" offset="7600525">The questions put, thought they had variance, the question essentially was to each juror, “Do you have a conscientious or religious scruple against the death penalty?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.010" offset="7649426">Sometimes that was added, or “Are you opposed to…” or “Do you have an objection to imposition in a proper case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.553" offset="7691640">Where a proper case was never explained to any of these prospective venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.380" offset="7718912">That alone was sufficient ground for cause and in each instance His Honor sustained, the challenge for cause without more inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.457" offset="7779203">As a matter of fact, if Your Honors please, the practice is so set and was so set in Illinois that the Court became impatient and he said to Mr. Kissane distinguished assistant states attorney in Cook County was here at the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.724" offset="7864362">I would go to this juror and ask that question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.801" offset="7880662">Let's get this out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.107" offset="7885887">Let's get all this out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.485" offset="7899366">And at one stage of the proceeding, either the court or Mr. Kissane at the direction of the court turned to the whole then venire which happened to be in the courtroom and said, “Are there any of you who have conscientious scruples against the death penalty?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.462" offset="7971255">And those who have merely raised their hands without warrant, five of them who just raised their hands, they were excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.455" offset="8023291">Now, there were -- of these 47 who were excused, there were 10 men, 9 women, and 27 which I will have to call neutered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.920" offset="8093090">Neuter because the widest jury was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.460" offset="8107301">The number that -- veniremen's number or venireladies' number, 95, 97, 55, whatever it happened to be, the court would say number of ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.497" offset="8151395">And either the lady or gentleman would rise and the question would be put to the venireman without even inquiring as to his or her name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.243" offset="8190370">And if that faceless as far as the record is concerned, prospective juror responded, “Yes, I have conscientious to the scruple” or “I'm opposed to the death penalty,” the judge said to them, “Step aside.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.972" offset="8257348">That was a typical word, to step aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.508" offset="8267483">But if they respond that they didn't, then he said, “Go into the box” and then the further questioning went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.871" offset="8296950">So you have 27 who are identified by a mere number here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.272" offset="8330491">Now, only five responded that they could not impose the death penalty under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.788" offset="8384616">The others' responses you'll notice in the appendix, both to our opening brief and supplemental appendix by -- in the brief of the state are the very expressions of this reluctance or view with respect to death penalty or opposition to death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.062" offset="8477717">But there were no direct inquiries as to the effect which might -- these views held might have upon either the issue of guilt or innocence or on the extent or nature or character of the punishment to be imposed by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.372" offset="8538948">Now, because of that systematic practice then obtaining and still obtaining in Illinois that all who express any view, and I say any because the degree is a number in the inquiry into the degree, of position opposed to or conscientious scruple against the death penalty automatically excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.993" offset="8665381">Now, we say that because there is no rational relationship between the sustaining for cause, under that situation and the issue of the view of that juror, a prospective juror on the issue of the guilt or innocence or on issue of punishment that that was then an arbitrary exclusion resulting in, if Your Honors please, the state in Illinois tendering to the defense and to the defendant despite the provision of the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, the United States that it should be entitled to a fair and impartial jury and equal protection of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.314" offset="8862657">He is permitted, the defendant and his counsel, to examine only veniremen who are tendered after the state has excluded from this cross-section of the community, all those who hold any views -- any views regardless of the degree on the issue of the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2241.036" offset="9069547">The statute requires a jury to make a judgment as to whether they would recommend the death penalty, or as to whether the death penalty would be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.180" offset="9122105">And juror statute -- then the statute says that if a juror says that he a conscientious or a religious scruple against the death penalty, he will be excused because the theory I suppose that might be advanced in defense of that is if a person has a religious or conscientious scruple in general against the death penalty, he cannot faithfully carry out his statutory duty, which is to make a judgment in the particular case as to whether the circumstances of a particular case weren't the imposition of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.507" offset="9463474">That the mere expression of opposition to the death penalty, the mere expression of it regardless of degree to which it is held excuses the juror for a cause and deprives the defendant of a fair cross-section of the community from which to select a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3797.749" offset="15296408">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.477" offset="15311350">On behalf of the people, I will take 22-and-a-half minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.867" offset="15324933">In the weight of my rather limited time, I would address myself to the questions asked as opposed to going through the said argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.287" offset="15362550">Now, there's no doubt in my mind that Illinois law as it exists in spite of the fact that it was not a direct holding in the Hatz (ph) case, there's no doubt in my mind that if the jurors states that “I am in favor of the death penalty” that under Illinois law, that person should be disqualified for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.743" offset="15452411">In regard to Mr. Jenner's argument that the statute allowed a person to be excused for cause in the basis of mere opposition, again, I would say that there has never been a case law in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.259" offset="15526494">There is no reported case in Illinois which says that a person can be excused really because he is opposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.922" offset="15553139">I don't think that the practices employed in this record shows that anyone was excused for mere opposition alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.957" offset="15589292">In that respect, I would point out that when the first juror, first prospective juror was examined, the question was asked, “Do you have any conscientious or religious scruples against imposition of the death penalty in a proper case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.199" offset="15642164">And he said, “I don't understand the question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.728" offset="15652300">So the Court and the assistant states attorney, Mr. Kissane, then went on and they said, “Well, we're going to submit evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.665" offset="15684065">You, you'll be instructed the rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.241" offset="15694409">If it is your opinion and the opinion of the other individuals, would you return a death verdict?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.154" offset="15721994">And he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.853" offset="15728786">And the Court then went on to say something about “Under no circumstances would you oppose a death penalty?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.202" offset="15758252">And again, the juror said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.813" offset="15768701">And the Court then said, “Well, what you mean is you have conscientious religious scruples against imposition of the death penalty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.430" offset="15795137">And he said, “Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.008" offset="15801407">Now, it's true that the trial court did not go through that, go through each of the perspective jurors with that particular particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.767" offset="15844456">But periodically throughout the course of the examination in regard with the six prospective jurors, either the ones who were excused, he did question them specifically as to whether or not they would impose a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.692" offset="15900150">In each one of these six cases, the juror made it clear that under no circumstance would he in fact impose a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.402" offset="15931079">At one point, one of the jurors said, “I have conscientious religious scruples against imposition of the death penalty” and yet, the judge persisted in his questioning when it turned out that it was a matter of a conscience where she said that she was really reluctant to serve on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.407" offset="16007043">The judge in fact tendered her to the attorneys for examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.946" offset="16029194">And there was only -- after she stated the -- she didn't feel --</text>

            <text syncTime="4718.860" offset="18980822">Now, again, I think that even if in fact a -- if a juror says, “I have a conscientious religious scruple,” even if he does not fully understand -- he does not fully understand that this means that -- it should mean that he will not under any circumstances impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.451" offset="19095239">We say simply that it is yet not unreasonable and that if in fact some of those jurors were excused for cause or perhaps shouldn't have been that it does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.521" offset="19155529">And I think that it ties in with the point that Justice Fortas made that it might very well be two, we remember that the trial took place in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.533" offset="19203594">I think the trial court's clearly indicated that he was trying to come up with 12 individuals who had not feelings one way or the other way, and I think that's clearly did it for both the prosecution and the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.321" offset="19254690">And going in, they are the two basic points, whether or not there's been a systematic exclusion which is unreasonable, and I would point out that in spite of the fact that this Court has said that a systematic exclusion is unconstitutional, that it is always in its opinions, if not explicitly, implicitly made it clear that the mere exclusion of a group of individuals is not unconstitutional per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.213" offset="19394288">At every state, and I think this is directly involved in this case, every state has numerous exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.810" offset="19420620">Now, I think that perhaps a fireman or a minister or something like that, one individual minister or one individual fireman or the like might not necessarily be of such -- be of such import that perhaps the public good would be hiring the fewer to be called for jury duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.235" offset="19518318">I think we have to look at the classification and determine whether or not it's reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.787" offset="19540574">When you have an exclusion of individuals that is reasonable on its face, I think that if in fact one or two or a small number of those individuals are not in fact -- if perhaps the exclusion of a few of these individuals is not warranted, I think nevertheless, we do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5692.009" offset="22873485">I would say that it's -- we think clearly reasonable to excuse a juror who has an actual bias.</text>

            <text syncTime="5705.673" offset="22928133">For example, in the Erwin case decided by this Court where the Court said in effect even though the jurors said they could be fair and impartial, in fact since they read the newspaper accounts and the like, we think that the possibility of their being biased and therefore, we're going to reverse the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.795" offset="23000649">Now, we would say that whether or not a person's views are strong enough to justify his excuse has always been a matter of discretion for the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.722" offset="23040355">We say that it's not entirely unreasonable for a trial court to examine a jury and if he says, “I am opposed to the death penalty” if absent other features, we do not think that this is entirely unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.150" offset="23105975">But again, I would point out that in this case, we had two jurors which might be interpreted that way and to the best of my analogy, there's never been a practice in Illinois, no case has ever said that mere opposition is sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="6183.170" offset="24838102">First of all, the challenge for cause of one who had conscientious scruples against the death penalty existed prior to the time of the statute and was created in a case called Gates versus People on 14 Illinois and after the statute was eliminated from the statute books, the Supreme Court held that the law was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.440" offset="24911141">Second of all, the clear provision of the statute is that anyone who is opposed of capital punishment shall be excluded but I know of no single record that a petitioner is brought forth on in which a states attorney or a court asked the question of any prospective jury man, “Are you opposed to capital punishment?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.566" offset="24995673">The question has always been whether there are conscientious or religious scruples and I think that the statute was a surplusage and I would point out that in the first footnote to the respondent Wood's brief, we set out the law of -- all of the states have considered this and we point out that even in most of those states where statutes have been passed, the challenge for cause originally arose at the time of the law and we point out further that the interpretations of these statutes has been such that one could no longer I think arguably state that this is a matter of statutory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.313" offset="25174664">Particularly, I point out that many of the statutes set by the petitioner say personally of such scruples which will preclude him from returning a verdict of guilty and that most typical of this is California and the Western States have similar statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="6708.109" offset="26937825">Secondly, I would point out that there was no attempt by a defense counsel at the trial level to ask any additional question in connection with the disqualification for cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="7020.319" offset="28186687">Within -- within limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.426" offset="28191075">I should point out that there's a little tension between what's being advocated today and what's advocated in some other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7028.426" offset="28219079">In the North Carolina case in particular, what the Court complained about was really a double standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="7034.886" offset="28244992">They said that when a man said he had a fixed opinion as the guilt based on newspapers, the judge would cross-question him very closely to determine whether or not he were -- would be influenced by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7048.733" offset="28300372">Whereas as soon as a man said he had a scruple or didn't favor or didn't believe in capital punishment, then he would knock him off the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="7056.272" offset="28330465">I would point out that the new procedure, at least the recommended one, the ABA recommends it, is that when a man says he's got a newspaper opinion, you really shouldn't cross-question him so closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="7070.533" offset="28387516">That it's -- if you can conceivably get a jury by taking these people off the jury, you should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7078.543" offset="28419594">That was their recommendation where -- wherever feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="7082.634" offset="28435999">And I think that the Fourth Circuit was right about the double standard but I'd point out in Illinois, particularly in the Speck case to which counsel previously alluded, a very loose standard of challenge for cause was applied when the defense asked for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="7098.843" offset="28500783">A man expressed an opinion if he had been acquainted with certain facts that everyone agreed were prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.797" offset="28528577">Then in those circumstances, he would be excused and properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7110.114" offset="28545923">And I might point out that in the footnote of our brief where we referred to a recent federal civil rights prosecution, a man was asked -- were read the oath of the Ku Klux Clan and asked if they believe and subscribed to the principles of the clan oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.862" offset="28620842">And if they did, they said they did, they were excused for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="7133.165" offset="28638083">That was rather in contrast to the attorney general of Alabama's experience, Richmond Flowers, when he tried Wilkins, Collie Leroy Wilkins for the murder of Mrs. Liuzzo.</text>
            <text syncTime="7146.653" offset="28691999">But in the federal case, they did not ask each and every juror will these -- and in fact, I don't believe they asked any juror will these beliefs affect you.</text>
            <text syncTime="7157.162" offset="28734109">And now, it is possible that somebody who subscribed for the clan oath can be a fair and impartial juror in a civil rights trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7163.989" offset="28761381">Theoretically, it's possible but not very, and I would state that that same basis for cause was laid in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7174.469" offset="28803281">When a man states it is a matter of his individual belief that he has a conscientious or religious scruple against the death penalty, I think that that is a sufficient basis for cause, unless he wants to take the whole law back to the days where you just cross-question everybody to try to make incompetent jurors, and I don't think it's possible to do it in the publicity cases today.</text>
            <text syncTime="7194.872" offset="28884888">And I would point out that Marshall versus United States 360 U.S. no inquiry was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="7201.683" offset="28912159">This Court just reversed on the grounds of exposure of jurors to certain information.</text>
            <text syncTime="7207.304" offset="28934625">And I think the same issue presents itself in the civil rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7210.452" offset="28947268">I don't think we're to use the phrase used by counsel for the petitioner from the Murchison case in his reply brief that -- In re Murchison 349 U.S. 133, the statement is “but our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness, thereto” or thereto as in publicity cases, it was the defendant who was complaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="7233.711" offset="29040264">I don't think the standard of fairness of juries and the threshold of disqualification should be any different in the case of a state which is asking for a fair trial.</text>
