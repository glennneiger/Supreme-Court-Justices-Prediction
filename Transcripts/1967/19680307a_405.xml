            <text syncTime="64.878" offset="362872">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.048" offset="375515">The question presented by this appeal is whether the conviction of a chronic alcoholic while being found in a state of intoxication at a public place is prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.070" offset="435702">The case comes to the Court in this posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.271" offset="448449">On December 19, 1966 the appellant was charged in the corporation of court of the city of Austin, Texas with the offense of being intoxicated in a public place.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.914" offset="499022">He was tried and found guilty and he appealed the conviction to the county court at law of Travis County before following a trial de novo, he was again convicted and fined $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.855" offset="554820">At the conclusion of the trial, the county judge -- the county court under these circumstances and in this particular case being the court of last resort in Texas, entered findings of fact with conclusions of law and the appellant perfected a direct appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.521" offset="629426">I would like to point out the outset that appellant does not here contend that Article 477 is unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.950" offset="667146">What we do contend is that as applied to appellant, Article 477 is unconstitutional in that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.507" offset="705390">Appellant being a chronic alcoholic, afflicted with the disease of chronic alcoholism who can not resist the constant excessive consumption of alcohol and whose appearance in the public is involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.574" offset="761710">Appellant's story is typical of the stories of many Americans afflicted with this disease, and I might add many indigent Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.316" offset="800684">At the time of the trial, he was 66 years old, and he had a history of drinking dating back till 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.813" offset="838614">He was injured on the job in the middle of 50's, injured his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.135" offset="855960">He's been unable to do heavy physical labor since.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.365" offset="868812">He drinks everyday namely wine and beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.899" offset="886993">He gets drunk to the point where he passes out only once a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.894" offset="902980">In short, his drinking is limited only by his financial resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.041" offset="923564">His financial resources are derived wholly from the money he can pick up shining shoes -- excuse me -- in a local bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.497" offset="961390">This averages approximately $12 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.127" offset="979884">In fact, in 1966, the fines imposed on him for punishing him for this disease exceeded 20% of his total income.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.417" offset="1033070">The arrest records in Travis County alone reflect 73 arrests since 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.408" offset="1072985">This is only part of the story.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.344" offset="1092733">Back in 1951 or 1952, there was one for disorderly conduct, but all of the arrest are merely for public drunkenness, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.966" offset="1135261">He estimates that in Travis County and in Bastrop County together, he's been arrested approximately a hundred times.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.323" offset="1168697">But again let me emphasize that this is only a token expression of evidence of the degree to which this man drinks.The number of times he's intoxicated as he says “I've been very lucky in avoiding police arrest.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4844.989" offset="19483355">Now what that might mean, I suppose would depend upon further decisions of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.072" offset="19503626">But under the Carter case in the District of Columbia where similar matter was litigated, they said that the crime would be a product of a mental disease if it would not have occurred but for the mental disease, which is to say a very little cause or relationship was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.749" offset="19566320">And indeed the cause or relationship had to be negative by the prosecution beyond the reasonable doubt in order for the man to be convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="5142.209" offset="20672240">Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.506" offset="20673390">I think that in other words I think that this statute has a prophylactic function in the sense that even though this man at present may not be staggering out in front of a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.815" offset="20714663">Or even though at present may not be cursing pedestrians or walking by, he can be removed from the street before these things occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.329" offset="20756668">And I think too there are aesthetic aspects to this type of prohibition which are of importance to many Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.600" offset="20801808">In other words, I think that being in a sort of bowery type of atmosphere is extremely disturbing to many people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.586" offset="20829706">I think many people would prefer to have their communities not be this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.118" offset="20851858">But I think there's a substantial aesthetic element in this specific crime which we're involved with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.364" offset="20904835">With respect to the statement that chronic alcoholism is a disease, we've made some sort of attempt in our brief to state our position and I won't say much more except this, that when we use disease in this context, we're not using it in the context of something which is capable of scientific verification that it is or is not a disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.482" offset="21001279">The American Psychiatric Association has -- my note on that escapes me for the moment, but the American Psychiatric Association calls alcoholism a personality disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.293" offset="21096573">A class which includes disorders of psychogenic origin or without clearly defined tangible cause or structural chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.370" offset="21132831">Academic psychiatrists who are the only people I gather frequently ask themselves seriously what do psychiatrists mean by disease, although occasionally it's required now in medical – in legal contexts as well, indicate that what we mean by disease is disorderly behavior or deviant behavior I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.584" offset="21229693">That the classification of disease within which it maybe asserted that chronic alcoholism is a disease, in other words, is not a category which precludes criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.500" offset="21273370">It's a category which overlaps criminality because the psychiatrists are also concerned with deviant behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.258" offset="21308374">Well why then is there so much concern whether it's a disease or it isn't a disease?</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.496" offset="21325406">Well we suggest there's concern because disease has so much emotional force.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.614" offset="21345782">You find various groups interested in achieving with respect to alcoholic saying alcoholism is a disease, alcoholism a disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.945" offset="21383189">The reason they're doing this is not because this is a descriptively meaningful statement, but because they realize it has this emotional force.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.075" offset="21423626">Now as to chronic alcoholism as itself, as the court -- as some members of the Court have noted, there are a whole variety of different types of definitions frequently framed in terms of social deviancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.404" offset="21489037">For example endangering public moral, safety and welfare, or altering his -- interfering with his mental health etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.750" offset="21522369">Now it is quite true that there is commonly in a definition, although not always, an indication that the criterion is whether a man can control, whether he can control his behavior with respect to drinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.245" offset="21588302">However, how can we determine whether a person can control his behavior?</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.531" offset="21609514">It is said “Well you can't ask him because alcoholics are can not frequently to be depended upon to give away --“</text>

            <text syncTime="5393.040" offset="21675551">In other words, assuming a person is said to lack ability to control what is meant by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.207" offset="21708152">It's not something which can be observed and scientifically demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.139" offset="21731976">As far as I can see what it really means is that the expert from the standpoint of his values or for what -- or from the standpoint of what he assumes to be community values is believing that the individual is acting unwisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.654" offset="21789968">Now I that Judge Bazelon was coming to that point in the Washington case which we just decided at the end of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.243" offset="21816299">That when the psychiatrist was talking in terms of behavior controls, he said this was largely merely a façade with respect to the moral judgments of the psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.505" offset="21873351">If you say in the ultimate sense on the basis of this person's whole life history that you can -- that it seems likely that he will continue to drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.806" offset="21910549">It seems to me that that is a sort of thing that can be said with respect to criminality in general if you assume, as psychiatrists tend to assume, that people are controlled by their prior histories and their genetic equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.024" offset="22015457">We attempted to make our position clear with respect to the defendant's assertion that the criminal law only ought to apply to people who act because of freewill.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.113" offset="22063835">We believe that this is a controversy that is not essential to constitutional adjudication of who is to be criminally responsible and who is not to be criminally responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.624" offset="22125902">It is clear to us that the criminal law traditionally has not required free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.338" offset="22144711">For example, typical insanity test have not required freewill and even the Durham Rule does not necessarily require freewill if mental disease is thought to have some significance beyond volitional criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.626" offset="22225899">Furthermore, the criminal law hasn't said to a person who is uncontrollably angry and who's charged with homicide that you were to be exculpated because you didn't have freewill.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.038" offset="22275532">We believe that the criminal law is rational as applied to even a chronic alcoholic for it includes givig him an opportunity for food, clothing, shelter or period of compulsory continence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.314" offset="22336658">The D.C.crime report indicated that the health of chronic alcoholics in the district had markedly deteriorated following the Easter decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.324" offset="22372707">Now, it may be as additional facilities are brought to bear that things will get better, but it seems that that is a completely or is a largely unpredictable matter because we don't have very much experience with alternative facilities in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.466" offset="22441253">Now we don't have very much experience as to how much for example cooperation alcoholics would give if voluntary facilities are made available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.945" offset="22479182">Counsel for the appellants cited the experience recently in Saint Louis in which he indicated that 95% of the alcoholics referred to their detoxification center, had stayed there as long as the doctors wanted them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.739" offset="22534353">Actually the figure was 97%, however the maximum stay there was only seven days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.343" offset="22556714">And we don't -- and these were alcoholics who were threatened with criminal prosecution if they left.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.023" offset="22591509">Presumably, that would not be allowed if the court decides as appellant requests here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5756.520" offset="23129422">However, if you will examine the context of these figures, you will find that these do not refer to populations of skid row alcoholics the sort of person who we are primarily concerned with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.979" offset="23195251">The one congressional record citation which is given was changed in the edited version of the congressional version, I assume, because it made it clear that it was referring to a hospital population and not to a population to persons who are being arrested for public intoxication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.577" offset="23257631">United States Public Health Service came up with quite different figures in a recent study, which is cited in our brief, namely that it was thought unlikely that more than 10-12% could be even aided, even aided and aided may only mean that a person decided to stay sober a little bit more often.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.680" offset="23358046">Well it may be that things would be much better than that, it may be, but we do not yet have the data to know.</text>

            <text syncTime="6225.655" offset="25005955">One question we've already addressed ourselves to and that's the question of what are the chances of improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.573" offset="25029674">If indeed we are not likely to get substantial improvement with respect of a lot of alcoholics by referring them either to the streets or to alternative facilities, it seems that that would be a reason not to force this sort of a program across the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.428" offset="25129044">One thing that would be helpful to know for example is how many chronic alcoholics change their way of life under present practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.358" offset="25168854">We don't really know this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.441" offset="25173138">We know that there are an awful lot that don't that we don't have studies that indicate what the incidence is of those who do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6279.737" offset="25222353">And we don't have studies indicating what the comparative results are between a detoxification approach of a few days detoxification as in a medical facility compared to a few days detoxification in a jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6296.273" offset="25288495">Somehow, detoxification has a much more pleasant sound, but essentially detoxification is an opportunity for a person to sober up I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.079" offset="25343666">I would be very interested in studies which are now for example being undertaken with respect to the Saint Louis experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.909" offset="25391000">I understand that since studies are being done by Washington University at Saint Louis, however we don't have the results of those studies yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.342" offset="25420779">Mr. Hutt says there's a bowery project that's been inaugurated, be interesting to find out what the success of that program is, but we don't have any information yet, and there's some studies in other cities as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="6344.614" offset="25481801">Well, ultimately we submit, society is faced with a series of possible choices in terms of what ought to be done with respect to skid row alcoholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6357.020" offset="25531434">We feel that there are three essential alternatives which are before society.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.972" offset="25555257">Now one is that the present procedures continued to be allowed that criminal or civil processes be allowed with respect to alcoholics and in some communities essentially leaving them alone would continue to be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6382.020" offset="25631431">And this would include probation programs and various other types of programs which are tied to the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.681" offset="25674062">However, the appellant urges that well the criminal process itself ought to be forbidden in part because jails are frequently badly ran institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.300" offset="25720560">Well we feel that here is a real opportunity for the notion of cruel and unusual punishment in its traditional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6413.072" offset="25755669">If indeed jails in some communities are badly run institutions then it would seem to us appropriate that those jails be thought to be cruel and unusual punishment, and in a historically sanctioned sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.918" offset="25823065">And that those facilities would not be continued to be used not only by habitual alcoholics but by any other people who are subject to penal confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.554" offset="25869563">A second alternative is to permit civil commitment only and I gather this is commonly in approach which is appealing to the medical profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.723" offset="25914284">It is frequently thought that people who are heavily committed to drugs or to alcohol can not be cured under that patient basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.878" offset="25942915">They have to be taken to an environment where there's more control that the environment ought to be continued until the processes of attempted pretreatment can be continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.789" offset="25998503">The model for this approach to the treatment of alcoholics would be the State Mental Hospital or the juvenile detention facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="6483.488" offset="26037373">Objectives of treatment and isolation would indeed be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.237" offset="26064332">However, in spite of the eagerness of some people to funnel people to civil facilities and indeed of course this has been the approaches of the States of New York and California following the decision of the Robinson case with respect to narcotics addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="6509.139" offset="26139878">It seems to us that there are some real problems with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.169" offset="26160044">We feel that the criminal process has great advantages in terms of the specificity of the charge which must be levied, the specificity of the statutory proscription that a person can not merely be confined on the basis of some person feeling that he is ill under the Vega's criteria and that he requires treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.878" offset="26230888">And we feel that the specificity of sentence also has an advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6535.515" offset="26245413">There's an advantage in the fact the defendant after four days in jail would get out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.937" offset="26275088">His disturbance of Austin society was not so great as to justify indefinite incarceration and the criminal process had the advantages compared to the civil process, it seems to us, in not permitting for his own good and under a theory of benevolence, indefinite in incarceration is as frequently the case with respect to civil commitment approaches to treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.827" offset="26394728">It seems to us, in other words that the experience in the Galt case where we had probably, I suppose by and large a much more tractable population that we were dealing with in terms of juvenile delinquents than we do with respect to people whose long time drinking habits have caused them to be characterized as chronic alcoholics by and large, should make us very wary of saying to the medical profession “Well you take these people over and treat them if you will.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6679.673" offset="26822092">Now this is largely the approach which has been followed in the City of New York for many, many years and there it led to the bowery.</text>

            <text syncTime="6955.249" offset="27924355">For example, I could imagine that it could be thought that the social objective with respect to removing chronic alcoholics themselves did not justify their incarceration, but the social objectives with respect to chronics alcoholics who for example were uttering obscenities might indeed justify subjecting them to the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.566" offset="28017664">But the difference between those two cases seems to us not to be in terms of their analysis of the principle they suggest whether one is more volitional than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="6993.004" offset="28075342">It seems so us in -- that the case goes not only to the alcoholic, to the addict, to the sociopath etcetera but that the case essentially asks this Court to adopt standards for criminal insanity which would be of a constitutional dimension would be applicable throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7011.749" offset="28150366">Because again the principle they urge is one which requires a volitional insanity test, it seems to us, namely they urge that a person whose behavior is the product of something denominated in mental illness that this person be exculpated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7027.939" offset="28215150">In other words, it seems to me they're also asking for the abolition of the insanity test currently prevalent in most of the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="7157.815" offset="28734673">I'm informed that the states have statutes with relating to civil commitment of alcoholics to quite generally and that they typically limit the term of permissible commitment between 30 -- between I think either 30 or I think between 90 days and three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="7177.951" offset="28815130">The reason I was asking, I suppose there're a lot of these people who are in the condition of this man whose case is here today who would much rather be in and out of jail the way he is than to be committed to a mental hospital for a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7201.340" offset="28908753">And I just wondering what would happen if he couldn't be convicted and a state had no compulsory incarceration in a mental hospital before he comes before the court and say “Well, I'm an alcoholic and I can't” -- no “I'm not an alcoholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="7218.511" offset="28977403">I can restrain myself alright but I just didn't do it this time."</text>
            <text syncTime="7226.981" offset="29011257">And what could the Court do if would it try him and find out that he was an alcoholic, and if they found he was an alcoholic they say “Well we can't do anything one way or the other to you.”</text>
