            <text syncTime="20.606" offset="185762">Peoria Indians the petitioners here recovered a judgment for approximately the amount of $172,000 before the Indian Claims Commissions by reason of the fact that the United States had failed to comply with provisions of Article 4 of the Treaty of May 30, 1854 to sell the petitioners' lands at a public auctions and instead had sold them at fixed prices thus returning the Indians a smaller award.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.350" offset="332779">The government did not appeal from this judgment, but the petitioners did appeal because we contend we are -- that the petitioners are entitled to an additional award measured by interest by reason of the failure of the United States to comply with the provisions of Article 7 of that same treaty requiring that the $172,000 which should have been realized be invested.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.864" offset="482826">The appeal that we took to the United States Court of Claims under the provisions of the Indian Claims Commission Act resulted in a decision adverse to us with three judges writing majority opinion, opinion by Chief Judge Cowen and there was a dissenting opinion of two judges, written by Judge Davis, taking the view that we were entitled to the relief which we sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.972" offset="643218">Now the facts in this case are relatively simple and they have been established by the decision of the Indian Claims Commission as affirmed by the Court of Claims and they're as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.687" offset="698075">On and prior to May 30, 1854 Peoria Indians owned a small tract of land on the eastern boundary of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.409" offset="732975">On that date, the Kansas-Nebraska Act became effective which opened up Kansas to settlement by non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.640" offset="773935">On that same day, this treaty with the petitioners was made wherein the Indians and the United States agreed that the Indians would convey their lands to the United States, the United States would sell them at a public auction for the benefit of the petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.809" offset="914578">Upon the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the non-Indians moved over into Kansas and squatted on the lands including the lands of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.863" offset="978840">The squatters pressured -- put pressure upon the government to buy these lands under the Public Land Laws which entitled the first settler on a tract of land to purchase that land for a fixed price under the land laws prevailing at that time and the fixed price was a $1.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.296" offset="1068596">The Commissioner of Indian Affairs requested the Attorney General of the United States an opinion as to whether or not it would be proper to sell to the squatters on the Peoria lands, the tracts on which they had squatted under the preemption statutes, and the Attorney General of course answered that it would be a violation of the treaty, a breach of trust and a fraud upon the Indians because the bargain which the Indians had made was for a public auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.370" offset="1200880">Despite the Attorney General's statement or opinion, official opinion, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs expressly instructed that the land be sold in a such a way as to give the squatters on it the right to buy it at fixed price, the equivalent of preemption rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.792" offset="1282591">The Indians Claims Commission found that had the lands been sold under a public auction, the way the Indians had agreed that a $172,000 approximately additional would have been realized than was actually realized and the judgment which was entered here was for that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.532" offset="1385514">Now, it is our position that under Article 7 of this treaty, we should have had an additional award measured by interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.688" offset="1434102">Article 7 which is reprinted several times in the briefs among other places on page 2, says in part, “And as the amount of the annual receipts from the sale of the lands cannot now be ascertained, it is agreed that the President may from time to time and upon consultation with the Indians determine how much of the net proceeds of such sales shall be paid to them and how much shall be invested in safe and profitable stocks, the interest to be annually paid to them or expanded for their benefit and improvement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="368.209" offset="1576208">In two cases decided by this Court past Mille Lac and the Blackfeather cases which are cited on our brief, this Court held that provisions to return income from the Indians capital in land sales applied in a -- to proceeds which should have been realized as well as those which were actually realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.107" offset="1695848">Petitioners believe that the decision of the Court in those cases is in accord with the traditional principle contract law and should have been applied by the Court of Claims in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>

            <text syncTime="642.101" offset="2671783">The Act provides that all of the petitions which Indians might file before the Commission had to be filed before a date certain and that date has been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.594" offset="2717759">It also provides that the United States waives the defenses of laches and the statue of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.693" offset="2854118">Now the chief defense that has been raised to our plea for return under this article is the doctrine of sovereign immunity in which the United States says that it is not liable for interest on claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.773" offset="2930500">And it points to two aspects about the treaty in support of its argument, one is the discretion of the President and the other the fact that a specific rate of interest is not mentioned in Article 7.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Joseph</label>
            <text syncTime="843.263" offset="3476459">Oh yes, I was about to answer that Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.567" offset="3493595">The -- in general from the middle of the 19th Century to date United States has paid 5% on obligations which it owes to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.330" offset="3548662">I suggested two variations which the Court might consider in that rate in this case, one in favor of the Indians and one against the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.982" offset="3599339">The reason I suggest that 6% up to 1860 is because it appears that the -- that, that part of the proceeds which were actually realized, those sales in 1857 were invested in securities which returned a minimum of 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.869" offset="3674885">After 1860 it appears that the funds were replaced by a -- the securities were replaced by a fund in the treasury which bore 5% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.512" offset="3725458">The United States has paid 5% interest on Indian funds up until the 1930s when Congress in the statute enacted for the purpose of determining the amount of interest reduced the rate from 5% to 4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.668" offset="3794004">So that is the reason for these three rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.776" offset="3822425">Now the doctrine of sovereign immunity which is the major issue raised by the -- or perhaps the only issue if I read them correctly, that the government raises does not apply to contractual obligations of the United States and in that sense since we are claiming under a contractual obligation, if this contract says we are entitled to the allowance to the relief of which we seek, the doctrine of -- we are without the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.933" offset="3959097">On the other hand if the contract doesn't provide for it, the Court doesn't need the doctrine of sovereign immunity to deny us the interest because it is by virtue of this contract that we are claiming, so in that sense the whole discussion of sovereign immunity is in apposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.448" offset="4041122">Now we come to look at the words of Article 7 and I would -- I think here even though the Court of Claims really agrees that this treaty says what we say it does, the Court below treated it as an interpretation problem and in doing so they considered it in the light of various rules which construe contracts strongly in favor of the United States and against claimants and they make no mention of the long line of cases which are cited by Judge Davis in his dissenting opinion which say that treaties within Indians should be interpreted favorably, in favor of the Indians, in the spirit of generosity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.914" offset="4230980">But actually I don't really think this is an interpretation problem, because the majority of the Court of Claims, the minority in the Court of Claims and I believe the government if I understand their position here, and we all agree that what this treaty meant was that the proceeds received from sales of these lands were either to be paid immediately over or were to be invested in safe and profitable stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.930" offset="4331081">What we are arguing about is what the effect is of that provision, that there is no question about what the provision was intended to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.946" offset="4383117">Now there are two things which the government looks at as I say and I think that they are -- can be analyzed separately, one of those the discretion which the President had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.002" offset="4435362">That is, point to the language, the President may from time to time and upon consultation with the Indians determine how much of the net proceeds of the sale shall be paid to them and how much shall be invested in safe and profitable stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.666" offset="4490010">The government says in various ways that you cannot know how much you might have pay over to them and therefore how can we make any award.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.370" offset="4960841">Perhaps they do not concede it because -- no, I would say the government concedes it because in their brief, they make the argument that we wouldn't know how much the investment would return, that is might have been a bad investment, the United States might have invested the Indians money in something very bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.782" offset="5050493">I wanted to get to that argument of course and I think that it is an argument unbecoming of the trustee and one which trustees have not been successful with anywhere and that the United States here assumed the duties of a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.572" offset="5129697">On this discretionary aspect, I think the first thing that militates against the government's position are again Mille Lac and Blackfeather cases because in both of those cases we had an element in which the government had the option to pay over rather than invest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.982" offset="5211303">In the Mille Lac case the statute which embodied the agreement provided that with respect to a portion of the fund, 5% not the whole fund as in our case, Congress could agree to appropriate -- not to put the money in an interest bearing fund but could agree to take it out and spend it for the benefit of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.282" offset="5320495">Later, in the lawsuit in which it was found that the United States breached its contract to the Indians by selling Mille Lac's land under the government land laws instead of at a public auction and damages were awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.778" offset="5382457">The fact of discretion, that there was discretion given to Congress in that case did not affect the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.041" offset="5415581">Similarly, in the Blackfeather case and an analysis of that appears in the next to last paragraph of Judge Davis' opinion and I submit that his statement about it has not been answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.486" offset="5481305">The United States had the option to pay over the fund after consultation with the Indians and before the lawsuit was even brought, the fund which had been realized was paid over to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.612" offset="5553821">When the lawsuit was brought after the fund had been completely paid over that is the fund that had been realized and the Court found that there should have been additional proceeds realized, the Court held that as to those additional proceeds since they were not paid over, interest would be allowed on them till the date of payment and the fact that they might have been paid, that the discretion might have been exercised had the money been realized earlier was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.945" offset="5691120">Now I can see no difference between the Blackfeather case and the case we have at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.706" offset="5726229">And when you come to look at it, the Blackfeather and the Mille Lac case and this case should be governed the same way because after all the money wasn't realized not because there was an act -- a discretionary decision by the President, but rather because there was a breach of the obligation of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.375" offset="5816822">The fund was not realized by a reason of a deliberate breach and therefore the money did not become subject to Article 7 and if the majority opinion of the Court of Claims is allowed to stand what the affect is to condone neither paying nor investing the amount, the $172,000 which should have been realized and depriving the Indians of the benefit of their bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.641" offset="5953912">Now, another aspect of the discretion involved here is --</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.060" offset="6215659">I do agree with that, but I think -- I cited some material which I believe shows that the United States actually treated this as a covenant to pay interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.542" offset="6261530">In the 1850s, there were a number of Indian treaties which provided that the Indians should get a return on safe and profitable stocks because says the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the report cited by Judge Davis, that the embarrassed condition of the treasury and other causes, Congress did not see fit to appropriate the money to purchase the safe and profitable stocks and instead appropriated the interest annually at the rate of 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.535" offset="6401546">So, Congress itself considered that the return of 5% interest was the equivalent of investing in safe and profitable stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.578" offset="6445641">The other thing is that it is our position that the United States here assumed the duties of a trustee and specifically assumed the duty of a trustee to pay over or invest, and that we can look to trust law to determine what kind of damages are recoverable from a trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.405" offset="7001004">Our starting point here is the historic and unchallenged rule that the United States is not liable for interest except where it affirmatively consents to such liability by statute or treaty or contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.285" offset="7072475">This Court has repeatedly held both in Indian cases and in non-Indian cases that no court has power to award interest against the United States in the absence of consent given in clear cut and unambiguous terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.519" offset="7137468">Now the only exception to that rule, if it is an exception, pertains to claims for just compensation under the Fifth Amendment taking of property, which can itself be viewed as a constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.323" offset="7192639">In any event petitioners here have never suggested and do not now suggest that this is a Fifth Amendment claim that they are asserting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.514" offset="7225448">This is fundamentally a breach of contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.382" offset="7240913">The critical question here therefore is whether Article 7 of the treaty of 1854 supplies assent to the imposition of interest and I think I'm on common ground with the petitioners in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.786" offset="7306533">At least they advised the Court below whether or not appellants are entitled to interest depends on Article 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.392" offset="7340910">Conversely they have never suggested and they do not suggest today, that they are entitled to interest by virtue of anything in the Indian Claims Commission Act and any suggestion to that effect would be contrary to a long line of decisions to the Court of Claims and the Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.696" offset="7414157">Accordingly if the requisite authority for an award of interest is to be found at all, it must be found in the language of Article 7 and the critical provision which has already been read to you, but I'd like to read again, says simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.270" offset="7472462">“It is agreed that the President may from to time to time and upon consultation with said Indians determine how much of the net proceeds of said sales, shall be paid to them and how much shall be invested in safe and profitable stocks, the interest to be annually paid to them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.153" offset="7555950">Now the Indian Claims Commission studied that language carefully and could not find that it constituted an undertaking, an obligation of the United States to pay interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.648" offset="11409951">But maybe its minimal but at least there is a language that sounds like a bond, that sounds like an obligation of the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.324" offset="11452688">Even more so in Mille Lac which they -- which petitioner's cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.103" offset="11471809">There all money accruing from the disposal of said land shall be placed in the treasury of the United States to the credit of the Chippewa Indians as a permanent fund which shall draw interest at the rate of 5% per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.999" offset="11527398">Now that we submit is the sort of language that meets the test or it meets the standard of an express consent to pay interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.184" offset="11560103">Article 7 contains no undertaking that anyway resembles that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.611" offset="11581837">Moreover and this is particularly important thing, it's quite clear that the language of the Peoria treaty is not some accident or fluke of draftsmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.359" offset="11624782">The treaty in 1854 followed upon reports by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs which were transmitted to Congress by the President in 1852 and 1853 urging the discontinuance of the practice of holding Indian funds in the treasury and appropriating annual interest payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.898" offset="11707016">It was urged that the investment of such funds in marketable securities would reduce the treasury's surplus, would benefit the national economy and most important would relieve the government from the payment of the immense sums which the annual interest must eventually amount to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.202" offset="11788204">That would seem to make it very clear that there was no purpose to assume a liability for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.142" offset="11815894">That the purpose was the very opposite to relieve the treasury of that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.256" offset="11840345">Under these circumstances we submit that the Court of Claims was entirely right in concluding that it would be judicial treaty writing to read into that agreement an express promise by the government to pay interest and I think it's clear that judicial treaty writing is what petitioners really have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.537" offset="11921533">In the language that was referred to earlier they asked for an award of 6% from 1857 to 1860 and 5% from 1860 to 1934 and at such rate as this Court deems appropriate thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.101" offset="11979734">Now its perfectly clear that Article 7 nothing about 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.800" offset="11994572">It says nothing about 6% and it certainly says nothing about such rate as this Court deems appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.022" offset="12023411">Now perhaps by way of confession and avoidance petitioners seek to escape from the government's immunity to liability for interest by urging in their reply brief that the government has misrepresented the nature of their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.154" offset="12079940">They do not they say seek interest on a claim but rather damages measured by interest for the failure to invest under the express provisions of Article 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.940" offset="12127169">Now this distinction between interest on a claim and damages measured by interest is a distinction without a difference, the two are Tweedledee and Tweedledum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.541" offset="12165517">Their brief -- at least the distinction is so illusive that it eluded petitioners until now, because in their brief in the Court of Claims they clearly said that this appeal seeks the recovery of interest on an award of damages and that is how the Court of Claims understood it and that's how the Indian Claims Commission understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.446" offset="12245138">Furthermore I think it's helpful to keep in mind that this case involves the breach of one provision, not two provisions of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.246" offset="12276381">Unquestionably the land was not sold in the manner provided in Article 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.005" offset="12303444">But there's no claim or at least there wasn't until today, that the United States was guilty of any default under Article 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.851" offset="12334791">That is to say the money that was actually received from the sale and was allocated by the President for investment was in fact invested and the income was scrupulously applied to the petitioner's benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.426" offset="13017109">Yes, I suppose that the critical thing is that Congress could have appropriated the money that was the difference long ago and it didn't, and no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.526" offset="13085445">All I meant to suggest is that there are really two categories of injury flowing from the original fair and it was grievance fair, no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.797" offset="13126510">One is the Indians didn't have the full value of their land in 1857 and were aggrieved about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.200" offset="13164126">The judgment has been entered for that for $172,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.691" offset="13182098">The second category of injury and it's one common in all litigation is that they did have the use of that money over 110 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.975" offset="13223267">Now is the sort of injury, the sort of damage that under any of the waivers of sovereign immunity Congress has generally declined to provide a remedy for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.340" offset="13276766">It has generally declined to pay for it's own delay in providing a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.953" offset="13403199">No, that was rights arising under an Act of Congress undertaken to pay for a ship that it has destroyed. He said Congress undertook to have a Court find the value of the ship that was destroyed, but the fact that you haven't had that ship for the last decade is not what Congress undertook to pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.179" offset="13488044">I also think it's worth noting in this connection very briefly that petitioners claim for damages measured by interest is in it's nature a claim that accrues over time, year-by-year, yet the Indian Claims Commission Act expressly provides that commission shall not consider any claim accruing after 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.016" offset="13575398">Now at very least that means, I suppose that the Commission isn't entitled to award interest for the last 20 odd years, an amount greater than the underlying claim in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.627" offset="13617925">But I also suggest that it reflects a congressional intention or expectation that generally they were not dealing with claims, the sort of interest that accrue over time.</text>
