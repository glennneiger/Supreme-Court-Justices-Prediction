            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll now call No. 11, Igor A. Ivanov, Petitioner, versus United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Benett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="14.385" offset="160893">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.598" offset="165804">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.885" offset="186911">The petitioner, Igor Ivanov, a citizen of the Soviet Union and employee of Amtorg, a Soviet Trading Company stands convicted of a conspiracy to commit espionage against the United States under Title 18 of the United States Code Section 794.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.292" offset="308537">His conviction was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals in the Third Circuit, the petition for certiorari was filed here and without detailing the intermediate pleadings, between the filing of the petition for certiorari in this oral argument, it's surprising to say that pursuant to the order in the Kolod case, the Government conceded that certiorari should be granted that there should be a remand that the District Court for an in camera ex parte hearing with respect to electronic surveillances conducted in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.667" offset="458062">Now, in the brief filed in this Court in Ivanov, the Government says that conversations of each of the petitioners in these cases were overheard by the use of the electronic surveillance equipment and footnoted is this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.096" offset="551790">In some of the instances, the installation had been specifically approved by the then Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.045" offset="579584">In others, the equipment was installed under a broader grant of authority to the FBI and affected the time which did not require specific authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.982" offset="615320">Experience would indicate to us, I submit that that is a concession of both wiretapping and eavesdropping in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.838" offset="654712">Now, this case is significantly different from the case just argued at bar because the Government seriously averse in this case that there is a national security consideration to be waived in the balance of competing social interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.790" offset="742484">I think it's equally significant, if the Court please if I may say so at the outset of this argument that the Government by that reason does not ask for different treatment between Alderman and Ivanov.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.034" offset="799535">It asks for precisely the same treatment, it asks for in camera ex parte proceedings with respect to the logs electronic -- the logs memorandum records of the electronic surveillance in each.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.044" offset="855542">Now, first of all, it is our position as the Court please that the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution does not make a division among the various kinds of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.465" offset="917191">It does not draw a line of demarcation and the founding fathers when the Constitution was written and when the American Bill of Rights were forged understood quite clearly that there is a difference in the various types of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.935" offset="983124">They gave recognition to this in Article 3, Section 3 of the Constitution when they defined treason and they prescribed the quantum and quality of proof necessary for a treason conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.945" offset="1035160">But they didn't make any exception in the Fourth Amendment with respect to spy catchers or subversive hunters.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.713" offset="1070268">Now, it's next to our position, if the Court please, that if the Attorney General of the United States certifies to the Court that there is a national security consideration which should excuse the United States from making a disclosure with respect to the nature, the time, the place, or the fruits of an electronic surveillance illegally conducted, we say he should be excused, provided he consents to a dismissal of the prosecution under the time-honored principle of Kaplan against the United States which was decided in 1950, an opinion by Judge Learned Hand which was forced where with the facts in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.319" offset="1320626">There was electronic surveillance, there was an espionage case, there was an alleged spy, a convicted spy and the premise was articulated there that the Government had a choice of making a full disclosure to the defendant for the vindication of our constitutional rights or dismissing, the Government dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.568" offset="1405680">Now, that case and I think it's significant to note has stood on a sale by the Government for 18 years until argument was heard in this case last term and that case was simply a repetition of the doctrine articulated also by the Second Circuit in United States against Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.254" offset="1520410">So it's our position, if the Court please, reduced to its essence that the concept national security should not be the talisman for a pro tanto suspension of due process of law or of any of the rights guaranteed to an accused in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.737" offset="1614346">If, in the conduct of relationships between governments in our time, it has become the custom or it has become a necessity to engage in wiretapping or eavesdropping or dissembling or purloining or burglarizing or even killing, it is not our argument in this Court today that the Executive Branch should be manacled or impeded or harassed in the conduct of relationships with other governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.647" offset="1805981">It is our argument here today that at least the federal courts should be a sanctuary in the jungle, and that these morals and that these mores should not be imported into the American judiciary system and that the fruits of this kind of conduct should not become evidence in a criminal case brought by the sovereign power against an accused, nor should leads derived from this kind of conduct be available to the prosecutor in a criminal case brought by the sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.196" offset="1956133">In essence, as I understand the Government's position, in this case, it's asserting its right to be let alone and to that we say ?Amen?, so long as the evidence is not offered in a federal criminal proceeding.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="481.375" offset="2028857">But that's not quite the issue is it Mr. Williams or perhaps I misunderstand, the issue is how shall it be determined whether the evidence is being offered or fruits of the unlawfully obtained evidence is being offered, perhaps I misunderstand but I thought the Government's position was not to defend the use of such evidence but that the Government's position was to insist that whether such evidence is being used or the fruits thereof are being used should be determined by the judge in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.558" offset="2181622">Am I wrong about that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Benett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="520.638" offset="2185906">I think that is the Government's position Your Honor, the Government's position is the same in this case as it is in the Alderman case and we say that just as it is impossible for this kind of determination to be made in the Alderman case it's equally impossible for this kind of determination to be made in camera ex parte why the judge and even though the issue may affect national security but the Government has argued in its brief at great lengths that we are seeking to impede the Government in assuring the national security and I say that we are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.334" offset="2364688">I say that we are not asking that any rules be fashioned to impede or harass the Government in the conduct of its affairs with other governments or in the conduct of its duty to preserve the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.957" offset="2419231">We are asking for a much narrower rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.565" offset="2433651">We are asking that this kind of evidence not be offered in Court and we are saying that the same rules should pertain to this kind of evidence as obtains with respect to any other kind of evidence that there should be a disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.013" offset="2491434">The disclosure maybe made under Rule 16 as the disclosure maybe made and any other kind of case to eliminate a necessary dissemination of the information so that our position if the Court please is that the defendant has the right to disclosure under appropriate protective orders and he has the right to disclosure to his counsel under appropriate protective orders regardless of what the nature of the information may be, regardless of whether or not it is contended by the Government that it affects national security unless the Government is willing to dismiss the prosecution in which case we agree that it should be dealt.</text>

            <text syncTime="656.206" offset="2728208">We don't -- we didn't say but nevertheless in a national security case it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.017" offset="2743463">There are other considerations in a national security case which argued for the in camera submission you not -- you don't read the Government as making that distinction?</text>

            <text syncTime="702.245" offset="2912319">I read them as asking for the same kind of hearing and I also contend if Court -- the Court please that protective orders can be fashioned here just as in the Alderman case and if we are driven to the unhappy conclusion that the alleged spy goes free, then I think we can draw some consolation from the history of the last three decades that in three decades of recorded federal jurisprudence during which there were three wardens, we have only one instance of an averred spy going free in this frame of reference and she was the defendant in the case to which I alluded to Kaplan case, and I think we could also get a measure of consolation from the fact that of all the crimes in federal jurisprudence, the lowest amount of recidivism takes place in the area of espionage because once a spy is exposed, he is by and large diffused.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.446" offset="3265181">Three others who were Soviet nationals who had diplomatic status enough to go back to the Soviet Union with our blessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.832" offset="3322650">Now Your Honor, with respect to the problems that this Court has propounded on standing in this case and the Court has propounded some hard questions with respect to the subject of standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.394" offset="3380955">Now for purposes of standing, we do contend in capsulize form that a person agreed within the purview of Rule 41 is one against whom the search -- the illicit search is directed whether he's known or unknown at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.236" offset="3472280">We say if the Court please that for purposes of standing, the concept must be considered under rule describing an aggrieved person.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.704" offset="3530167">We say, if the Court please, that it must considered against the fact ground of an age in which electronic surveillance has become a widespread investigative technique and we must consider it in the light of the philosophical rational for the federal exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.624" offset="3625880">Now, rational in the federal exclusionary rule has been articulated many times by many courts as being simply that the courts recoil at the philosophic concept that the end justifies the means in the administration of criminal justice that the exclusionary rule is designed as a deterrent to lawless law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.331" offset="3712711">It's designed to discourage it and to effect compliance with the agents of the sovereign power with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.133" offset="3743953">Now, it is our position that the rule on standing for which the Government contends is -- are kept and that it is ineffective against this black ground During the early evolution of cases under the Fourth Amendment by and large, we were concerned with cases where the defendant's constitutional rights had been invaded by virtue of the search of his premises and the seizure of his papers and his effects so that in the great majority of cases, there was not a serious problem of standing but we have passed that here on and we now have an era where electronic surveillance is used in the following manner as is illustrated by many instances in our papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.963" offset="3979264">The Government through its agents does not listen to the suspect, it does not invade his premises electronically by planting an electronic bug there rather in a very careful selective manner, it listens to the conversations of his relatives and friends and associates, and it invades the premises of his relatives and friends and associates, and it gathers criminal intelligence by this fact which it indexes and computerizes and makes dossiers until such time as it has by utilizing these leads developed a situation wherein an indictment can be secured by the presentation of some of these evidence to a grand jury and subsequently a conviction can be obtained by the use of the same evidence and that the suspect defendant is left without a remedy because the Government contends he was not victimized because he was not heard and because no premises in which he had a proprietary interest where invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.651" offset="4285942">I suggest to the Court that the Government's position on standing in this case with respect to electronic surveillance is like Solomon's approach to the baby, Cut it in half!</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.693" offset="4370160">Says the government, there are two competing social interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.357" offset="4392835">One, that the culprit should not go free, society has a major interest in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.581" offset="4417703">The other, is that there should be a deterrence in illegal methods of law enforcement, the Government's proposal would satisfy neither competing social interest, why, because it says that a selected class of culprits should go free, those who fall within their concept of the term standing but on the other hand, the green light should be flashed for a continuation of illicit electronic surveillance because this kind of activity can remain tremendously fruitful and beneficial in the gathering of criminal intelligence without giving the ultimate victim a status to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.334" offset="4636714">Now we say, if the Court please, that the time has come for standing to be given vis-à-vis electronic surveillances to the following: one, to those whose conversations are illicitly listened to and the Government does not gainsay this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.459" offset="4733158">Two, to those persons whose premises are illegally invaded by electronic eavesdropping equipment and as I read the Government's brief at page 21 in the Alderman case, it clearly does not gainsay this, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.594" offset="4837752">As I previously read to the Court, the Government says it adheres to the position that a defendant though not a participant, if the overhearing occurred on premises owned by him or in which he had some interests, he has a standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.810" offset="4910582">Now, I suggest to the Court that one who is the subject matter of an overhearing illegal in nature must have standing if illicit electronic surveillance is to be deterred by federal agents and finally, --</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.035" offset="5071496">I assure you that consideration has been given to all of the competing social and legal interest in making the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.458" offset="5105246">I believe that standing must be given to a codefendant in a criminal case whether he'd be named as a coconspirator or not and I say this first of all, because it is hard to conceive that defendants can be joined in a criminal case in the federal courts under Rule 8 which provides for joinder of defendants, unless there be what could have been averred to be a conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.499" offset="11969390">Incidentally, there is an aspect with respect the standing that I can make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.398" offset="11996975">The fact is that Ivanov and Butenko were never overheard talking together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.781" offset="12026546">There are overhearings of Ivanov and there are separate overhearings of Butenko, and I supposed that an argument could be made that Butenko has no standing to object with respect to the overhearings of Ivanov and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.202" offset="12120168">However, in none of these cases did the overhearing have anything whatever to do with the evidence which was actually produced at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.645" offset="12169906">It is totally irrelevant to that and the problem which I am concerned here is the appropriate protection of the Executive Branch of the Government in carrying out the President's responsibility to conduct the foreign relations of the United States and his responsibility as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.752" offset="12282337">I think an argument could be made that what was done here does not violate the Fourth Amendment, because the Fourth Amendment forbids unreasonable searches and seizures in those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.348" offset="12336776">And the question as to what is reasonable obviously varies with the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.333" offset="12364675">But we are not making any contention and there is not involved in this case any question of the admission of evidence which was obtained by a reason of electronic surveillance and we are contending that there was no evidence admitted in this case which is the fruit of the poisonous tree which was derived from an electronic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.132" offset="12479927">Mr. Williams has argued very eloquently that in a free country that the Executive ought to be free to do this but then it ought to be put to its choice either to disclose or to abandon the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.554" offset="12581595">Now actually as it has been pointed out in the Kaplan case, the prosecution was abandoned and Mr. Williams said that was the only one in all the year since what in the brief for Butenko on page 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.392" offset="12664978">There are cited two other cases, United States against Egorov and United States against Sokolov where cases were dismissed "in the interest of national security" and there had been other cases which have not been brought because the evidence was in fact obtained through illegal surveillance and the officers of the Government felt that they could not appropriately proceed in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.301" offset="12792560">But here we have a United States citizen and a Russian citizen not entitled to diplomatic immunity and we have a situation where disclosure has been made that there was electronic surveillance and the suggestion is made that that electronic surveillance is entirely irrelevant to anything which has a period in the prosecution and it is our position and I think I should be frank to say that this is the case in which we are concerned not to Alderman and Alderisio, we can live with that of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="4199.384" offset="16900890">That has two effects, one of which is that if the judge decides that the evidence was stated, then there must be a new trial but the other is that because of that, the government prosecutor is going to be extremely careful to see that he does not introduce evidence which can be regarded as tainted because he does not want to go through the process of having a trial and then having it set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="6303.408" offset="25317021">And I must say to footnote Your Honors observation that I was surprised and I use the word surprised consciously as understatement to hear the Solicitor General say that Alderisio had no standing with respect to monitoring premises in which he had a proprietary interest when he himself was not present because in the very brief filed by the Government at page 21, the Government says, "In our memorandum filed last term, we assumed that a criminal defendant would have standing to challenge unconstitutional electronic surveillance if one, he was a participant in conversations overheard in this manner or two, although not a participant, the overhearing occurred in premises owned by him or in which he had some other interest at the time, we add here to this position."</text>
            <text syncTime="6370.666" offset="25586082">Now if the Court please, what is the Government saying here?</text>
            <text syncTime="6378.189" offset="25616175">It says, we have the logs, memoranda and records resulting from this illicit electronic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6387.363" offset="25652851">And we're not going to give them back to the victim of this electronic surveillance, rather, we are proposing a procedure by which we make a confession to the trial judge of the nature, the time, the place, and the fruits of our transgression and let the District Court judge evaluate that confession and determine in camera ex parte what is arguably relevant to the pending prosecution and what is the reason for which they advance this procedure?</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.494" offset="25821393">They say in the case at bar because these logs, memoranda, and records may contain errant gossip without claim of the truth and injurious to third persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.109" offset="25891819">So, we say then to the Government as the logical next question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.684" offset="25914075">Well, what about those logs, records and memoranda that are obviously and patently and palpably not injurious to third persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.112" offset="25963813">And what does the Government say to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.968" offset="25975202">With what I suggest to the Court is a rather cavalier and bizarre disregard for consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.864" offset="26010833">They say, "The practical problem is that neither the Government nor the Court can ever now with certainty when disclosure to the defendant of an overheard conversation might be harmful to other participants in the conversation."</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.674" offset="26086066">I say mutatis mutandis that how can the judge know whether failure to disclose the logs, memoranda, and records of the overheard conversation might be harmful to the defendant in the vindication of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.631" offset="26157850">They go on to say at page 15, there are situations where even the disclosure of a conversation that is innocuous on its face can prejudice third defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.202" offset="26208214">I say mutatis mutandis there are situations where conversations which are perfectly innocuous on their face may be lethal in suggesting leads to evidence gathered by law enforcement agencies for presentation to the grand jury and for subsequent presentation to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.167" offset="26304031">They say at page 15, the experience of the Department of Justice in reviewing cases involving electronic surveillance to determine when disclosure must be made has indicated that because the factual situations are so varied, it is almost impossible to draw general rule of disclosure that can be applied to a broad class of cases and will avoid the possibility of injury to third persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6579.041" offset="26419493">To that we say amen and we say that it's impossible to draw a rule of demarcation that will avoid through an in camera ex parte proceeding that will avoid injury to the defendant in the vindication of his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6599.592" offset="26501726">The only safe course says the Government at page 15, "We submit is to decline the order disclosure whatever it is clear that nothing in the materials submitted is arguably relevant to the prosecution."</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.369" offset="26556897">We say if the Court please that the only safe course when we are talking about the vindication of constitutional rights and when concededly the trial judge cannot make this determination in camera ex parte without the aid of the defendant and his counsel is to make these conversations which had been illegally seized available to the defendant and his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.854" offset="26642787">We say if the Court please that the Constitution, the law and the basic rules of fair play require the disclosure of these materials to the victim of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="6651.920" offset="26711019">If the Court please as was pointed out earlier this morning, it couldn't reasonably be argued by the Government if there had been a search of the defendant's premises, a ransacking of his premises and a seizure of his papers and records, and letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6672.665" offset="26793984">It couldn't reasonably be argued by the Government that those materials which were seized from him shouldn't be returned to him but rather should be handed up to a District Court judge to determine whether any of them had arguable relevancy to the pending prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6691.131" offset="26867858">We say, if the court please, that the same basic principle applies with respect to conversations which are protected within the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="6777.273" offset="27212466">To concretize it, the case where the defendant whose premises are electronically monitored, and the monitoring picks up conversations of A and B when the defendant is not present and the question as I understand posed by Your Honor is, what's the defendant's standing to get those conversations and I suggest that there are competing social interests and there are competing legal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.635" offset="27313925">What are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="6803.724" offset="27318314">On the one hand, we have a defendant who has been charged with a criminal offense who is seeking to vindicate a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.652" offset="27349974">We have here a situation where the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment rights concededly by electronically invading premises in which he has a proprietary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.326" offset="27396681">As a result of that electronic invasion, they have ripped certain benefits, they have ripped certain fruits, they have gathered certain evidence which they proposed to offer against him because they are saying you have no standing, and it was not your conversation sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6837.415" offset="27453001">On the other hand, you'll have the competing social value of the two persons who thought they were talking privately maybe even against the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6847.194" offset="27492185">Now, what is their right?</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.208" offset="27496155">We are weighing a common law right to privacy of these people against a constitutional right of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6855.667" offset="27526040">What can be involved in that common law right to privacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="6858.702" offset="27538160">It may be a pecuniary interest, well if it's a pecuniary interest, I'm sure the Court will agree that it should be subordinated to the defendant's constitutional right and the right to privacy can be safe guarded effectively I suggest to the Court insofar as protective orders can be fashioned and tailored by the trial judge to protect those third persons from unnecessary disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.799" offset="27634604">And it's been our experience, if the Court please, that in everyone of the hearings which have been conducted as a result of an illicit electronic surveillance, the defendant himself has asked for protective orders because he does not want to proliferate the damage resulting from the Government's invasion of his privacy and so to can protective orders be fashioned to protect insofar as possible the right to privacy from further damage as far as third persons are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="6963.881" offset="27958941">Well, but Your Honor, I think you have pinpointed the situation that may constitute one-tenth of 100% of the cases and I think that even in that situation that the rights of the participants in the conversation can be effectively safeguarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="6981.384" offset="28028949">If in fact, we have a realization of the bizarre hypothesis that two people on the premises are talking about eliminating the proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6992.959" offset="28075238">Then and in that case, the Government I suggest to the Court has the choice of providing those persons with the same kind of protection that it provides to material witnesses in many cases where these interests are at stake or alternatively, if it does not wish to do that and wants to exalt their rights over and above the interest of the sovereignty to go forth with the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7018.402" offset="28177011">They can dismiss the prosecution but I do suggest Your Honor, that it is not practical, it is not feasible, it is not possible for a trial judge sitting in camera to make a determination as to whether any of the logs, memoranda, or materials resulting from the electronic surveillance where used by the Government in developing leads.</text>
            <text syncTime="7043.639" offset="28277948">I want to give the Court just one illustration of that and it's cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7049.821" offset="28302608">We have a case where there is a boilerplate indictment for income tax evasion charging the defendant in the typical language with evading taxes for a given year.</text>
            <text syncTime="7065.876" offset="28366869">The only thing they ever change in those indictments of the year and the amounts of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="7070.534" offset="28385468">Now, unlike Jenks Act materials if the Court please, unlike grand jury testimony, if the Court please, when we talk about a trial judge looking at the large memoranda and records of an electronic surveillance, we're talking about packing cases filled with materials, not sheets of paper and we're asking a trial judge to build a superhuman task of judge deposing packing cases of electronically monitored conversations against the skill of (Inaudible) of a criminal indictment using the wildest lights of his imaginative powers as suggested by the Solicitor General to determine whether the Government seize on any of those conversations and developed a lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.528" offset="28569475">Here's the case where the trial judge spent four weeks reading the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="7122.168" offset="28592044">They were so voluminous that he had to delegate the reading to another judge who helped him and together they took four weeks reading them and they came up with the answer which you would expect that there was nothing that they could find relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7134.807" offset="28642617">But when the trial of the case came on, this conversation which I submit no one could've determined was arguably relevant to the indictment turned out to be the origin of a lethal chain of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.278" offset="28700505">What is the conversation?</text>
            <text syncTime="7151.829" offset="28710640">"How are you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="7152.652" offset="28713984">It's one end of a phone conversation.</text>

            <text syncTime="7176.333" offset="28808756">Now, I suggest to the Court that no trial judge sitting before trial or after he had heard all of the proof in a three-week trial could have determined in camera ex parte that that was as it turned out to be the origin of a line of proof that was devastating.</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.934" offset="28899140">Now, what is more if the Court please?</text>
            <text syncTime="7202.117" offset="28911888">When this Court and other courts fashion rules designed to deter lawless law enforcement, we find that more sophisticated methods or device to countervail the rules of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="7217.103" offset="28971760">For example, when the Jenks decision came down and when the Jenks statute was subsequently enacted by the Congress, we found well motivated law enforcement officers zealous in the pursuit of their duties who found ways to put on paper in narrative form statements that were not susceptible to turnover under Jenks.</text>
            <text syncTime="7243.264" offset="29076459">When the Dennis case came down, and grand jury testimony was ordered to be turned over to the defense after the direct testimony, we found and our finding across the country well-meaning and zealous, able, competent prosecutors who seek to avoid this procedure with advantage to the defendant by having grand jury minutes no longer transcribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7269.831" offset="29182725">Now, in this instance, when we have a Kolod rule, what has happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="7277.407" offset="29213027">What can happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="7280.360" offset="29224835">It isn't any longer necessary, if the Court please, to make logs, memoranda, or records of electronically monitored conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7288.876" offset="29258898">We cite in our brief a situation where the age in charge of the investigation monitored the premises of the suspect 24 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="7298.764" offset="29298395">He listens to the conversations each day and if he saw anything in those conversations which he believed to be of interest to him, he would telephone to another field office.</text>
            <text syncTime="7311.809" offset="29350640">The information gleamed and he would ask field operatives to rundown those leads and the basis of the lead would be ascribed to a confidential informant protected from disclosure by McCray against Illinois and a lead would be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7331.151" offset="29427963">A file would be created and there would be nothing, nothing of a written nature to turnover to the trial judge for an in camera ex parte examination to determine whether or not there had been a fruitful violation of the defendant's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="7351.375" offset="29508838">So, I suggest to Court that it is not possible for a defendant to vindicate his constitutional rights in the area of electronic surveillance without an adversary hearing of full open adversary hearing and without a disclosure to him of the nature of the surveillance, the time of the surveillance, the place of the surveillance and the fruits of the surveillance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Danzig</label>
            <text syncTime="8109.423" offset="32541027">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8112.707" offset="32554193">The defendant Butenko is a co-defendant in the prior case of Ivanov argument which the Court has just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="8122.147" offset="32591914">I want to mention at the outset that there are three other conspirators who were charged in the conspiracy but were unindicted by reason of diplomatic immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="8135.435" offset="32645099">And their presence in the conspiracy may have some relationship to the problem of standing when it gets up into the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="8147.526" offset="32693478">Now, when the Court projected the issues in this case, the issues were projected on the assumption that there had been in the chronic surveillance in violation of the Fourth Amendment were passed that point now because the Government has frankly admitted that it has overheard conversations of Ivanov and Butenko.</text>
            <text syncTime="8176.262" offset="32808417">It has said nothing to date about any conversations that overheard of the other three conspirators who were not indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="8187.175" offset="32852093">And of course when it heard there may constitute a lead to the two defendants who were tried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="8197.233" offset="32892322">The main position of the Government is rather interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="8201.968" offset="32911235">It takes the position that whatever logs, whatever information it has on unlawful surveillances with respect to these two defendants should be turned over to a Court for examination in-camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="8221.807" offset="32990647">It says also quite clearly in its brief that if that were dug, it is competence that the Court would not find that there is any information in those papers and records that are turned over to the Court in camera that could in anyway have led to the conviction to evidence that was used in the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="8254.212" offset="33120214">I accept that statement of the Government as an absolute verdict and accepting it as a verdict, let us see just where we go in this case on the basis of the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="8269.909" offset="33183013">The Government comes in with these records, gives them to the court in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="8275.272" offset="33204433">The court now can only do one thing and we are really in a post-conviction situation and not a pretrial situation so far as Ivanov and Butenko are considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="8287.155" offset="33251976">There is a massive record of about 3500 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="8291.797" offset="33270575">There's a good deal of documentary evidence and I suppose the Court being its diligent federal judge will sit down and make a mechanical comparison of what the record it has received in camera contains and what the transcript shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="8311.929" offset="33351137">Assume that mechanical comparison is made and assume as I have assumed, the absolute truth of the Government's statement in its brief that an examination of these records in camera will convince any judge that they are no way arguably relevant to the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="8331.673" offset="33430026">I say, that if we buy that position or sanction of any matter whatsoever, that's the end of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8340.707" offset="33466180">That's the end of Mr. Alderisio and Mr. Alderman and Kolod and a lot of other people who similarly circumstance but before we end and this is rather interesting because if that happens, we have no problem with national security nor do we have any problem with the rights of third persons to what extent they maybe injured in person or in reputation, they just fall by the wayside on the basis of these assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="8372.425" offset="33593031">The Court will never reach those questions and this is exactly the position the Government has taken on the point of national security that about the page 8 or 9 in their brief here in Butenko, they say, "Please, do not put this to the option of making the choice whether to dismiss the prosecution or whether to make a revelation of what we have gathered.</text>
            <text syncTime="8401.254" offset="33708387">Please let us bring this in, in camera and we can satisfy any judge that there is nothing in these records which in anyway touch the prosecution so that we have no problem with national security, we have no problem with injury of third persons."</text>
            <text syncTime="8418.668" offset="33778082">Now let's see whether or not this position has any merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8424.451" offset="33801174">I submit it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="8427.126" offset="33811832">It's violative of so many things.</text>
            <text syncTime="8429.299" offset="33820609">It had been said time and time again by this Court with respect to ex parte or in camera proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="8438.623" offset="33857912">Take the Jenks case, the Dennis case which requires a turnover of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="8448.936" offset="33899081">It has been said that that turnover is not based on any constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="8454.307" offset="33920606">It's said that its based on the supervisory power of this Court has over the administration of justice in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8462.628" offset="33953834">On that basis and that basis alone it would seem to me an in camera proceeding would be unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="8472.095" offset="33991764">The Fifth Amendment which guarantees to every party and this United States due process of law, wouldn't that be violated by the Government going in with the massive material unattended by the defense either through counsel or through the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="8491.068" offset="34067623">And then when we look at the protection of the Sixth Amendment which calls for the assistance of counsel, a public trial, the right to confront the witness against you, none of those requirements which are embedded in our Constitution unmistakably or observed by this procedure that the Government wants this Court to improve.</text>
            <text syncTime="8518.352" offset="34176815">Now, when we take a look at the kind of records we have that they want to submit to a Court, that too should give I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="8533.142" offset="34235956">Now, I haven't seen nor has anybody seen the kind of records they have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8539.723" offset="34262288">This state will not show us until this Court determines how if and all or they are to be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="8548.590" offset="34297710">But we do have some information on that, a considerable information is incorporated in Mr. Williams' brief, in Alderman, and some of it appears in his brief in Ivanov.</text>
            <text syncTime="8564.126" offset="34359881">Now, what do we find there?</text>
            <text syncTime="8566.309" offset="34368658">We find a rather shocking situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8569.787" offset="34382555">We find a serious question whether all the records have been produced in the first instance and every time they produced records, they come along and some of later time, "Oh, we didn't know about these facts that turned up in some draw or corner."</text>
            <text syncTime="8589.309" offset="34460609">When the records are produced, we find that there's information in there that's commingled with other information, so as to conceal the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="8600.481" offset="34505331">Euphemisms or symbols are used to conceal whether or not the source of the information came from a live investigation or from an electronic bug or even a wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="8618.328" offset="34576697">There are cases where there are no records at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="8623.409" offset="34596968">As in the case Mr. Williams adverted to where the agent heard the telephone, played back the tapes, got -- heard the conversation, played back the tapes, called agents all over the country and started a chain of investigations on people and he has nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="8644.794" offset="34682546">Now, when we see the nature of the records, and we can only go by what we have seen in the past and what's now known and has appeared time and time before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8662.559" offset="34753599">When we see what kind of records they want to submit to a Court in camera, we say that we though not having our constitutional rights protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="8674.404" offset="34801037">We are advocating a course of conduct that's violative of those rights and the only way we can find out whether there's any integrity to the record or whether or not there's some illegality that's been concealed is by having a full pledge adversary hearing at which extrinsic evidence must be produced so that the defendant can be confronted with a live witness and not a record, the genuineness, the authenticity, integrity of which can be questioned and if we start with that, no court of justice and the pursuit of justice can tolerate a course such as now being seriously advanced by a government that is governed by constitutional limitations as this Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="8924.454" offset="35801213">The fact of the matter is that they have I think merely invoked the specter of national security to gain their main objective and that is to have an in camera hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="8954.746" offset="35922317">The reason I was asking these questions is what's going on in my mind is this if you take the sweep of Mr. Williams was talking about and what you're talking about as I understand that, the national security cases doesn't really -- does not mean that wherever there has been any electronic espionage over a vast area that may have some relationship to the defendant that in that vast area, the Government is faced with the choice of -- well, the Government really has to dismiss the case if there has been any electronic espionage in the or electronic surveillance in this vast area that we were discussing with Mr. Williams.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Danzig</label>
            <text syncTime="9004.637" offset="36121893">I should think that would be a fair position to put the Government into sense itself has created a predicament it finds itself in.</text>
            <text syncTime="9016.699" offset="36170167">There are rather means available to it, there are procedures of course under the crime control and that becomes a very simple matter you applied for a warrant with a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="9028.140" offset="36215933">But prior to that, there have been occasions when some governmental authority wanted to have some information and they authorized a surveillance and electronic surveillance of one kind or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="9042.759" offset="36274448">It could've been done within constitutional confines but this Government has acted lawlessly and set a very poor example for the rest of the people in this United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9055.324" offset="36324707">Now, let's go to the actual trial procedure that was used here for us to determine whether or not an in camera proceeding could in anyway produce a fair result.</text>
            <text syncTime="9071.954" offset="36391163">Now, the case was tried in a very interesting way by the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="9080.031" offset="36423450">He put on agent after agent and did not have them testify as to all the observations they made over a period of six months while these people where under surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="9094.150" offset="36479979">He put them on for let's say April 21st and after he testified for the surveillance, he took him off and put another agent on the pickup the termination of the first agent surveillance and went on with his and so on so that he had all the observations of the total day surveillance in that on that particular day, then he start it with the same agents and maybe other agents to go on and develop their surveillances on the other half dozen days over this period of six months of this particular thing took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="9129.088" offset="36619682">Now -- and that was a good way of doing it because the jury did not get confused, it could keep track of each day surveillance and see just what these people did.</text>
            <text syncTime="9143.671" offset="36678092">Now, on a Sunday, May 26, an agent by the name of Broderick and Your Honors will find this at page 595 of the trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="9155.232" offset="36724276">He was surveiling the defendant Butenko at his apartment in Orange, starting at 9:30 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="9166.966" offset="36771192">Mr. Butenko went to the store, bought a sandy paper, went back stayed there all day, and then got into his car about 5:20 p.m., went down Park Avenue and Orange until he hit the Garden State Parkway and the agent testified that he discontinued surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="9189.620" offset="36861889">He also testified he reinstituted surveillance about an hour later and picked up Mr. Butenko's car all by 20 miles north from the point where he terminated his surveillance in front of a restaurant in North Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="9210.706" offset="36946213">Now, we're talking about North Jersey, a heavily traffic area, many cars out on a Sunday and the jury would get the impression that Mr. Butenko had eluded his tail, the man who was watching him.</text>
            <text syncTime="9231.544" offset="37029595">Oddly enough, Mr. Broderick, the agent had no trouble picking up Mr. Butenko some 20 to 30 miles away, some two hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="9244.989" offset="37083303">Mr. Butenko comes into sight of three agents who are now in a construction -- in a trailer that's used on a construction site near a parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="9260.278" offset="37144534">And that agent that with a pair of binoculars and his two assistants with him says, testifies that he saw the Russians in their car come in at 6:15 and Mr. Butenko in his little Falcon come in a few minutes later and they all went around and then nobody got out of the car for they all followed one another out so that the two cars met.</text>
            <text syncTime="9292.784" offset="37274520">Now, I think the FBI is pretty good but I don't think they're that good that they could follow an automobile through North Jersey, have a surveillance interrupted, and then pick it up some 20 to 30 miles later.</text>
            <text syncTime="9310.560" offset="37345573">The clue to the thing is that these three agents who were in this trailer were there from 3 o'clock on that Sunday afternoon, the same day May 26 and they were expecting Mr. Butenko and they're expecting the Russians there.</text>
            <text syncTime="9332.645" offset="37433971">And I ask, how could they have known of this rendezvous because that's what it was but through a bug on somebody and to try this case on the theory that all these evidence was obtained through physical surveillance and not through a bug leaves an impression on a jury's mind which is not quite consistent with a fact and it makes me question whether or not evidence of that nature is reliable and whether all these physical surveillances were not a way of concealing the real source of the information namely the bug and I want to repeat a question that Mr. Justice Brennan quote in his concurring opinion in Palermo whether or not the interpretation placed on that statute, the Jenks Act would not encourage agents to prepare their reports in such fashion that they would be insulated from production.</text>
            <text syncTime="9410.462" offset="37745246">And I question here whether or not these physical surveillances and this omission of information about the real source of the clues and the rendezvous and whatever else was used in the conviction of these defendants, I question whether or not these records may not in view of the absolute faith the Government has in submitting the records in camera that it will disclose nothing relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="9448.776" offset="37898428">I question as Mr. Justice Brennan did whether or not these records contain anything about any electronic information, an absent, an adversary hearing we will never know and illegality will be the rule rather than the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="9473.166" offset="37996022">Now, one of the issue of standing Your Honors our position has been made quite clear in the brief, I don't think I have a time to really --</text>

            <text syncTime="9948.485" offset="39897318">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9950.793" offset="39906513">I would not have supposed that it would have been suggested that this was not a case involving the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="9961.701" offset="39950190">The fact is that Butenko is an American citizen was employed by the International Electronic Company which was under contract with the Air Force to produce a command and control system for the strategic air command.</text>
            <text syncTime="9979.361" offset="40020825">The system includes data processing and computer programming equipment designed to store and transmit operational information such as the location of aircraft and distances from targets which will enable the commander of the strategic air command to alert and execute all these forces at extremely rapid rate and provide him with up to the minute information on the status of the total force.</text>
            <text syncTime="10008.920" offset="40139003">The information supplied by the system may be provided either as a picture projected on a screen or printed page form and Butenko who had top secret clearance was the control administrator for the projects field operations division with complete clearance and there isn't any doubt that he turned over materials to a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="10042.408" offset="40272959">Now, it's true that the phrase national security can be use loosely.</text>
            <text syncTime="10051.004" offset="40307440">It can be use for example to relate to efforts to combat organized crime and things of that sort as we have used it in these cases that relate solely to relations with foreign nations and to efforts to guard against espionage and to protect military and national secrets of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="10081.214" offset="40428231">I would emphasize again that we are not in this case seeking to argue that the evidence is admissible although I can conceive of cases as for example if information is obtained that there is a ship on the high seas which contains a nuclear device which when the ship gets to New York Harbor, it is going to be exploded and by virtue of the very effective and determined detective skill, it is not only found where the ship is but it is also found that it was being brought here by group of Americans who were seeking to takeover the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="10132.123" offset="40631881">At some point, it sees to me there ought to be freedom to argue that whatever method was used to obtain evidence with respect to that transaction is not an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="10456.323" offset="41928704">General is -- I'll say two things that we've got to consider here, one, a question of the violation or alleged violation of the individual rights of the person who is on trial for his life, for his liberty; and secondly, the power of deterrence from doing illegal things by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="10484.779" offset="42042493">Now, we've read in the past and everyone has I think that the Government from time to time has disavowed any wiretapping or any bugging except that it has been said in a very, very few national security cases I think the figures has been as low as 20 or 30 in the country at a particular time and now we find out that after the new policy the government is concerned that it has been announced that there had been bugging in all fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="10525.163" offset="42204035">We find in the Katz case, in the little old gambling case that ended up in the fine of $200.00 that the Government bugged this place for over a month, night and day and we find that there are great many -- apparently a great many internal revenue cases where they have bugged the person just on income tax violations and still the Government asserts that its only done in national security cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="10561.911" offset="42351052">Now, don't we have the fashion or rule that will prevent the Government from doing that very thing if there is a way of permitting wiretapping or other bugging in national security cases shouldn't there be a law designed to accomplish that purpose and hasn't the Congress design such a law?</text>
