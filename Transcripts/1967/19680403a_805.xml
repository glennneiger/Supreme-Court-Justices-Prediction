            <text syncTime="88.197" offset="456182">The Gould Special School District is a small district of approximately 3,000 population.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.582" offset="477706">In the 1965-66 school year, when this litigation began, the total school enrolment was 879.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.575" offset="509680">As of December 1965, the District had taken no steps whatsoever to comply with this Court's decision, Brown against Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.610" offset="545834">It maintained at that time and indeed continues to maintain at this time two complexes of buildings about 10 blocks from each other, each one having an elementary and a secondary school.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.448" offset="597138">The Gould School, named after the community, is the White school complex; the Field School is all Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.901" offset="627022">After passage of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Gould instituted freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.102" offset="651786">It covered all 12 grades and it's interesting to note that a hundred students applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.312" offset="676655">There was not adequate -- a hundred Negro students applied to go to the White school; no White students applied to go to the Negro school.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.165" offset="695986">There was not adequate room for all the Negro students who applied to go to the White school, and 28 were sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.369" offset="724825">I might note that since then, freedom of choice has continued to operate and never again has the level attained anywhere close to a hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.518" offset="761396">It is covered around 70 and this school year's gone up to 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.446" offset="777174">But when it started, there was sufficient eagerness for a hundred to apply, which we haven't reached again.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.359" offset="800789">And these were children the 5th, 10th, and 11th grades and they were the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.205" offset="976227">The -- there's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.711" offset="982183">The Negro schools are very decidedly inferior and unaccredited, and the White schools are accredited as A.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="229.432" offset="1021053">There's also the difference in teachers' salary, which is explained as they put it on the base of supply and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.407" offset="1041011">They felt they could give the Negro teachers cheaper and they didn't see any reason why they shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.856" offset="1066820">Now, the -- the first year the freedom of choice actually went into operation, there were 70 Negroes who transferred to Gould and the second year, there were 71 and this year, there are approximately 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.432" offset="1125125">In the previous cases, there was considerable questioning from the bench concerning what was the motivation behind the institution with the freedom of choice plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.521" offset="1157413">But in this case, it's not necessary to guess that.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.036" offset="1171519">It set forth rather explicitly in the respondent's brief at page 18, I may read a sentence or two, “Since there are about” -- last paragraph on page 18 -- “Since there are about two Negro students for each White student in this school district, the procedure suggested by petitioners as a feasible alternative to freedom of choice would result in both schools being predominantly Negro if the White students continue to attend them.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.758" offset="1266395">However, most, if not all, would be withdrawn, although desegregation is an accomplished fact in this district and every White child is attending school where Negro students exceed 20% of the student body, the White parents in Gould would be no more willing than those in Chicago, Washington or New York to send their children to predominantly Negro schools,” so that's why the plan was adopted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.696" offset="1354167">There's -- this is offered as a justification on basis of the respondent's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.645" offset="1385932">During the case, a school construction program began and a motion was made at trial that the new construction, which was going to be a replacement for the Negro high school building that was built in 1924, be put on the White campus or the White school complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.301" offset="1460537">That was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.029" offset="1471509">Then, in the Court of Appeals, a motion was made that since the school already had been completed that there be some reallocation of the function of facilities, that is that the Gould complex be used as a high school facility completely for all the high school students and that the Field school complex be used as an elementary school complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.420" offset="1553011">It turned out the numbers are just about right.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.302" offset="1560534">Indeed, the Court of Appeals noted that that might be done but as it said, this was not the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.811" offset="1594598">And the trial court and the Court of Appeals approved what was done by the respondent's school district citing with approval and -- and as partial justification that the plan and its operation had been approved by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.102" offset="1671816">Therefore, we have a situation which a procedure has been adopted by respondent after more than ten years of violating the requirements of Brown which has the purpose that's stated in the brief and has had the result of continuing the existence of an all Negro school complex and the admission of small and stable proportion of Negro children to a formerly all White school.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.940" offset="1983091">Now, there has been in some of the Court of Appeals' decisions some debate over integration or desegregation or compulsory integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.369" offset="2020812">I think that becomes after a while a semantic morass.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.875" offset="2034918">I think the issue is what are the available alternatives?</text>
            <text syncTime="486.400" offset="2049024">What are the options a school district may exercise to end up with a school system which is as far as possible different in terms of racial composition or racial allocation than the school system they had before 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.850" offset="2110777">It may be that some of those options are a lot feasible or not attainable in terms of other educational considerations or expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.241" offset="2140348">That may or may not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.707" offset="2146200">But in this case, indeed in most instances, there are available options and we think those options should be -- the option which produces the greatest departure from the preexisting situation should be used rather than the option which produces the least, especially where the option was produces the least was adopted with that expectation in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.927" offset="4527104">In other words, in conclusion, the basis of our position is that when a school district is faced with the task of remedying preexisting segregation, one must look at what are the -- what are the options, what are the alternatives, and which of them consistent with educational principles and economic considerations is more likely to achieve the maximum integration or desegregation if you will.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.309" offset="5048613">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.320" offset="5064704">Mr. Greenberg's view on freedom of choice had change since 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.281" offset="5092498">During which year, he published his now classic book, Race Relations and American Law that's cited in our brief and where at page 239, he stated, “Moreover, the jury discrimination precedence may be recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.318" offset="5148609">Bias may be presumed from a consistently segregated result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.099" offset="5167731">A token number of Negroes may be legally equivalent to none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.167" offset="5184031">If, however, in education there were complete freedom of choice or geographical zoning or any other non-racial standard, and all Negroes still ended up in certain schools, there would seem to be no constitutional objection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.807" offset="5254562">And I endorse on behalf of the respondents in this case and embrace that principle entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.812" offset="5282670">He was entirely right when he wrote those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.329" offset="5296671">Due to the importance of the constitutional issues here, I want to allude only very briefly to the factual issues that are peculiar to this case, that are not involved or are different from those involved in the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.131" offset="5347871">With respect to the teacher salary differential, and it must be remembered this case was tried in 1965, the proof was that there was a small differential in the salary paid to the Negro and White teachers that the School Board had an active program for several years prior to trial narrowing that gap, and we're using all of the financial resources of the district to do it and it was comprehended that this was the last year the gap would exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.586" offset="5453720">And as far as I know, I haven't had occasion to confirm it because it hadn't dawned on me until I heard it mentioned in the argument this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.232" offset="5484335">As far as I know, the immediate year after trial, that gap certainly was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.033" offset="5499486">Those certainly were the plans at the time of the trial and the commitment made to the district judge, and he made that observation in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.073" offset="5535640">With respect to the equality of the facilities, the only facility which could be said to be unequal that was set aside or was -- had in fact been used historically by the Negro students is the Negro high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.763" offset="5594467">And at the time of trial, plans were already made to replace that facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.142" offset="5611917">It was an old building and it needed to be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.898" offset="5622993">And funds had already been earmarked to replace the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.035" offset="5639502">It has now been replaced and the campus occupied by the elementary school and the high school utilized by the Negro students in this district, the proof will show in this record is far superior to the facility used by the Black students because of the addition of this new building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.603" offset="5709824">The elementary school that had been attended solely by Negroes was already a relatively new and perfectly acceptable, perfectly useable educational facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.188" offset="5752142">With respect to the accreditation, the difference between the two, again, this was three years ago and the primary reason that the accreditation at the school attended by Negroes was not the same as that attended by Whites just because of this old high school building that had to be replaced before proper accreditation could be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.088" offset="5831764">With respect to the suggestion in the briefs and the very brief reference by Mr. Greenberg, to some intimidation or suggestion of intimidation in this school district of Negro students attempting or undertaking to exercise their rights under the Constitution and their rights under this freedom of choice plan, I don't want to take the time to get into the detail of that but it is covered in detail in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.059" offset="5931656">There's absolutely, Your Honors, nothing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.400" offset="5944926">I will rely on the expressed findings of both of the courts below that this School Board was in perfect good faith in adopting and carrying you a freedom of choice plan and undertaken to secure the rights of every student in the district, whether he'd be a colored child or a White child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.326" offset="6012635">There is testimony that I would refer the Court to on that subject if the Court is interested, I think the Court would be, in the attitude of the Board of Directors who are the defendants in this case toward the exercise by the Negro students of their rights and toward the education of the Negro students just like their interest in the White students, and that's the testimony of the president of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.440" offset="6105109">And his testimony when asked, was -- is there any intimidation when this was on rebuttal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.281" offset="6128515">Is there any intimidation to your knowledge, if you heard anything like that in this little community?</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.694" offset="6146173">And of course, a community that size, the president and the School Board are going to know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.663" offset="6162056">He says, “We've had nothing like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.254" offset="6172400">We've gone out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.419" offset="6176998">The board members have gone out and encouraged these Negro students here during this first year of the operation of the plan to send their children over to the White school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.444" offset="6217122">We've encouraged them to,” he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.003" offset="6223391">There's not a member of this board that doesn't have Negro people living on their property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.390" offset="7812890">There is some organized athletic activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.426" offset="7829086">I -- I don't know what sort of program they play on, whether they are large enough to participate in a formal scheduled program or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.184" offset="7864090">I'd like to point out that subsequent to Brown, there having been no intimation of course in Brown that the Constitution compels the intermingling of the races by any sort of predetermined mixture that what the people had to do, what the state had to do is quit discriminating, quit making racial classifications in public education, that the decisions of the Courts of Appeal of every circuit that had substantial school desegregation litigation were unanimous in reading Brown just as Judge Parker did that the Constitution doesn't commend integration and the spring board hadn't held that it does until the Jackson County case decided by the Fifth Circuit in the last year or 14 months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.258" offset="8076413">And with all respect of course to that Court, that decision is just wrong and its error can be demonstrated by looking at why Judge Wisdom says we've got to take a new look at this constitutional question because that Court was having to overrule some 50 of its own earlier decisions on this very Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.478" offset="8157288">He says what makes us take a different look at it now is the Civil Right Act of 1964 has been passed and it goes on to mention that the HEW has promulgated some guidelines on how to go about school desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.007" offset="8211414">And then, they examined the constitutional issues in light of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and concluded that it required the affirmative manipulation of the students in order to achieve affirmative integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.198" offset="8268152">And of course, the act didn't do anything of this sort, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.222" offset="8284244">Its own language is crystal clear and its legislative history is entirely consistent that the intent was to adopt the legal duty as the legal duty of local school officials in this area, that which was already their duty under the Fourteenth Amendment as construed by this Court in Brown, and there are expressed references.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.706" offset="8366164">Senator Humphrey who managed the bill on the Senate expressly said here's the Bell against School City case decided by Judge Beamer later affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit I believe it is, and certiorari denied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.349" offset="8428753">This is the sense of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.411" offset="8437008">This is the national policy that we're adopting that if the Constitution doesn't require manipulation of these people, it doesn't require overcoming racial imbalances, what it requires is that you do not discriminate, you do not classify these people according to race with respect to admitting and assigning them to the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.516" offset="8517465">And in the even that Congress left anything to be speculative about what its intent was in the '64 Act, in 1966 it came along and made it expressly clear in the 1966 amendments to the 1965 secondary and -- Elementary and Secondary Aid to Education Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.730" offset="8598340">And at page 42 on our brief, we set out this amendment which states that in the administration of this chapter, no department, agency, officer, employees of United States shall exercise any direction, supervision or control over the personnel, curriculum or program of instruction of any school or school system and any local or state educational agency are -- now, this is the language that was added by the 1966 Amendment that I'm about to read, are required the assignment or transportation of students or teachers in order to overcome racial imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.679" offset="8738043">That's the national policy expressed by the Congress with respect to any federal concern about racial imbalances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.527" offset="8797497">I'd like to say this of freedom of choice and since it's suggested that it was a recent innovation to escape constitutional obligation, I think that would be a fair characterization of what my adversary suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.409" offset="8864998">In the first place, it's a method of school assignment that had been followed by many districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.554" offset="8885582">It happens to be that the residential zoning, drawing zoning lines has been the predominant wave of assigning students to school on its country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.769" offset="10522415">They have suggested as their alternative or feasible alternative although there's no proof in the record that it was feasible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.175" offset="10692106">They file the HEW statistics concerning this district with this Court and I've taken those figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.064" offset="10715617">So you've got approximately two Negro students and one White student in each of those schools and I think that if we examine that situation with candor and the time I believe has come for candor and I want to speak to the Court with candor on this that we know from experience that the White students will not continue to attend those schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.823" offset="10974647">Well, we can't ignore what's going on for a hundred years in that community and whether that history is right or wrong, whether it's more with Christian is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.179" offset="11008084">It's a fact that we have to deal with and that has produced two groups of people with such cultural differences in that community, Your Honor, that when the predominant culture becomes that of the Negro people in the community, the White people flee from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.791" offset="11106513">It's not acceptable term and to say this that difficult thing to speak with -- to speak about with candor but I feel obliged to speak about it with candor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.398" offset="12561011">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.654" offset="12577938">It might be helpful at this stage to summarize the context in so far as it's common to these three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.421" offset="12617017">As the United States views these cases, they present three situations very alike and that, in each one, normal, old fashioned geographic zoning would achieve either a substantial measure or complete desegregation school district and yet, this long after Brown in each of these three schools districts, 80% to 85% of the Negro children attend all Negro schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.619" offset="12773857">At each and every one of the previously all Negro schools in each of these school districts remains today absolutely 100% a Negro school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.261" offset="12828400">It is that persistence of racial segregation that each of these districts it seems to us calls for a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.683" offset="12890154">There has been a lot of talk about compulsory integration and the challenge to freedom of choice is characterized as advocacy of compulsory integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.279" offset="12940518">It seems to us that that is a false issue as it applies to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.375" offset="12964864">We're not talking here about busting or any other extraordinary measures to accomplish a racial balance in the schools of the districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.230" offset="13008332">We're merely suggesting the old fashion traditional system of neighborhood schools of geographic zoning be followed here as if no doubt would have been followed except for the effort to escape the racial integration that would follow from such geographic zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.801" offset="13102582">To hear the respondent's one would suppose that there were some sort of constitutional right to children to choose their own schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.569" offset="13137690">There is of course no such right and that fact is in this country for a century has been to resign the children to the school even there is their home or on some other basis but without giving them any absolute freedom as to which school they wish to pick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.260" offset="13220446">One would suppose that the Brown decision had condemned not racial segregation but compulsory assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.448" offset="13261197">Shortly, Brown did not condemn the old system of assigning children to a school in the best interest of the district as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.895" offset="13306964">All it condemned was the system of racial assignments, not the system with compulsory assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.797" offset="13350536">Now, it's one thing and bad enough if the school districts after these many years in maintaining segregation, want to wash their hands at the problem and leave it up to the students or leave it up with somebody else to repair the damage that have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.368" offset="13424828">But that's not even to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.741" offset="13434337">They're not simply washing their hand at the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.897" offset="13446980">They're not simply advocating responsibility which it seems to us is theirs under the circumstances and in light of the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.551" offset="13481566">They're going -- taking affirmative steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.750" offset="13498389">They're going very far out of their way to create, to make it possible of resegregation or a perpetuation of segregation within the school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.482" offset="13553351">They're not simply letting the assignments fall as they would naturally by geographic zoning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3381.323" offset="13628688">That seems to us, Mr. Justice White, presents a quite different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.968" offset="13647287">I don't say that we wouldn't in that case argue that at least against the background of enforced racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.487" offset="13677275">There weren't some offended duty on the School Board to take measures or at least to avoid as between equal alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.104" offset="13711757">That alternative which is least likely to produce an end of the new school system but that is not what's involved here as I say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.195" offset="13756165">Rather these School Boards have taken quite extraordinary measures to avoid the natural result that would follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.106" offset="13799842">We condemn freedom of choice here in this context where it does seem to us to be an artificial device to delay, to retard, even to defeat the segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.245" offset="13856371">First, because it's so obviously artificial, it is not a traditional method of assigning, at least in the south of assigning elementary and high school students, whatever it may be, college area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.247" offset="13924394">It does seem to be educational nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.329" offset="13936724">It's a pure haphazard system in theory which takes no account of what things they might be desirable from educational point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.505" offset="13977370">At least in those cases where it requires long distance bussing as in New Kent, Virginia and in Gould, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.790" offset="14006523">It imposes a special financial burden on the school district and of course, it's an administrative nightmare if it works as it should in theory because not only do you have forms, letters to be sent out, receive, tabulate, count, all of which would be unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.441" offset="14085099">If the School Board to simply assign as it used to on the basis of residence, but the results are unpredictable from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.269" offset="14116446">School construction can't proceed on any intelligent basis if, as I say, it worked as it's supposed to in theory and the results were truly unpredictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.717" offset="14162213">Of course, the fact is that freedom of choice is not supposed to work toward the segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.720" offset="14186245">If it did, it would be self-defeating from the point of view of its office because pretty soon, the White school to which all the Negroes would transfer would become overcrowded.</text>

            <text syncTime="4352.547" offset="17513514">I don't suggest that this Court ought to prescribe the précised plan which any given district ought to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.129" offset="17543920">I do think it is both appropriate that fitting that this Court do condemn freedom of choice as applied in this sort of circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.447" offset="17589164">Let me hasten to say that we do not challenge freedom of choice in all circumstances as I think Mr. Greenberg mentioned in those situations where residential patterns of segregation are so strict that geographic zoning would produce a high degree of segregation of -- freedom of choice can certainly do no harm and it may do substantial good.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.206" offset="17708178">Now finally, I want to stress that because this is such a transparent device to unable the White students primarily and their parents to segregate or continue desegregation of the school system in a way that the state itself could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.543" offset="17805563">Because everybody understands that that's the reason why this plan was resorted to and because that message has been gone across both to the Negro community and the White community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.734" offset="17850284">We have a situation in which the state appears at least to be applauding, to be encouraging, to be at least sanctioning and approving a choice made on the basis of place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.327" offset="17900648">Since this is a device to permit the White students to find themselves a haven away from their normal assignment in a school which is mostly Negro and since the state has gone to such extraordinary lands and put such a burden on itself to make this choice available, it has thereby indicated to all members of the community that this is a legitimate and proper basis on which to choose your school and thereby it seems to me it has hardened those racials -- racial attitudes which is our purpose of educational desegregation to relax and it has also compounded the injury on the Negro children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.248" offset="18084342">It's bad enough to be segregated off to have that as the accidental consequence of geographic zoning which is wholly neutral is one thing but to have it as the consequence of a deliberate policy sanctioned by the state being shunned by the White students who live next door to them and makes the injury that much more severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.131" offset="18195937">That is the injury which the Brown decision is concerned about, that injury which is that much worse when it seems to have the sanction, the approval state behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.829" offset="18274722">Now finally and to conclude, let me repeat what I said at the outset, we do not in these cases think it's necessary to argue that the School Board had an affirmative obligation to take special measures to achieve racial balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.786" offset="18366568">That is not our argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.333" offset="18376704">Our argument is rather that the state must at least avoid resorting to extraordinary measures which can only be in their purpose and effect defeat or retard desegregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4603.687" offset="18518079">Mr. Claiborne indicated that he would not challenge the proposition that there is a tendency of the Whites to flee when a predominantly Negro facility develops.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.747" offset="18566353">I have evidence to support that in the form of the report of United States Commission on Civil Rights cited at page 60 of my brief where they say there's evidence to suggest that once a school becomes almost half or majority Negro, it tends rapidly to become nearly all Negro and this is consistent with the experience in life that we've had all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.617" offset="18661857">This isn't a sudden phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.774" offset="18670425">I do not want to be understood as arguing that the Court should approve the freedom of choice method of school assignment because it's the only one that will preserve the public schools in the rural south at least that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.745" offset="18726327">The Court should approve it because it's clearly constitutional where it accords to every one the full exercise of these constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.415" offset="18764988">And incidentally, it will preserve the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.460" offset="18785259">I think that it's interesting that in the three hours of argument we've been talking about schools and we've been talking about desegregation that nothing had been said really about education and how does it square with this and after all the purpose of the schools is to educate these children and I believe that the voice of an educator should be before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.337" offset="18864671">In the Tennessee case, there's a large appendix of many writings to assist the Court in determining what the practical things would be if you strike down the freedom of choice here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4813.305" offset="19356609">Reverting to the educational significance of this, it's been called to my attention this morning that it was put in the congressional record yesterday by Congressman Fountain, page E2532.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.889" offset="19418885">The same article that the attorney for the School Board in Tennessee case printed as an appendix to his appendix I believe he would call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.084" offset="19459741">That is as excellent a summary of absolutely impartial professional observers about the practical effects on education of the school desegregation process I've ever seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.800" offset="19526614">In that article, there is a full biography of the authors of the article in the congressional record insertion and I commend that to the board for its consideration on this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.861" offset="19586800">The Solicitor General has considerably changed his view apparently since the Goss case in 1963, only five years ago about freedom of choice as a device to resolve the problem which school district like this is confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.697" offset="19670183">He argued in that case Goss involved two Tennessee seats and he argued in that case that the School Board had a final alternative to this plan that was brought before this Court and attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.793" offset="19718562">It can take full freedom of choice and the particular merit and say that would be a constitutional alternative, no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.682" offset="19758059">And the particular merit by the way, this material from the Solicitor General's brief in Goss is in my brief in this case at page 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.870" offset="19790869">The particular merit of freedom of choice suggested by the Solicitor General Lynn is that it would avoid any child, Negro or White from being confronted with the mandatory prospect of having to go to the school that was predominantly populated by the other race.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.316" offset="19860668">This is a serious educational consideration and the Solicitor General was much more realistic about this practical problem at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.370" offset="19892851">I would like to suggest further that the alternatives that our adversary suggests, all of them are suggested for purely racial reasons to achieve a purely racial result and the only reason to offer an alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.969" offset="19947290">They don't attack freedom of choice per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.618" offset="19957844">If they don't like the result, it's achieved in this particular instance and so they offer an alternative to achieve a different result, a racial result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.200" offset="20008208">That -- those alternatives that they offer do not square with this Court's insistence that the state be neutral in matters of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.254" offset="20048436">That's the proper position for the state to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.526" offset="20061497">It must maintain a neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.110" offset="20075813">The Solicitor General says in his brief although in Evans v. Newton, the Court said, I believe Mr. Justice White wrote this and I'm not sure that the state must be neutral in racial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.372" offset="20144880">The Solicitor General suggests in his brief here that neutrality is not enough and pursues the argument along that line.</text>

            <text syncTime="5050.569" offset="20305690">I think that what was condemned in California was a procedure by which a particular individual could be denied the right to acquire that which he was seeking to acquire but under a freedom of choice plan, the particular individual may not be denied the right to acquire that which he is seeking to acquire and I think that's the basic distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5340.924" offset="21467094">My record says that there's no restrictions against the choices in New Kent County and I say to you that I know of situations in Virginia where White children have chosen to go to college schools and have gone and their parents are still employed and I know of no -- nothing untoward that happened to them when they made that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.015" offset="21547447">But I'll say to you also sir that there isn't a White person in New Kent County Virginia that can elect to send their trial to a segregated school in New Kent County, Virginia because there isn't one for White children in New Kent County, Virginia that can elect to send their child to a segregated school in New Kent County, Virginia because there isn't one for White children in New Kent County, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.536" offset="21609514">Every White child in New Kent County, Virginia goes to a racially integrated school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.786" offset="21634487">Now, one further point about the complications of this going to vast trouble to set up a system, the Solicitor General said that we go to long bus routes where complicated bus routes all over the county to get the kids to these two schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.200" offset="21700211">He then suggest that you could turn one into a high school and the other one into the elementary school and I wonder how he would bust the children without running those buses all over the county just as we do now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.169" offset="21748067">If you're going to catch them from all over the county to the two schools they're going to run buses all over the two schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.319" offset="21768652">As far as these complicated forms are concerned, I don't know of a simpler way in the world to find out which children are going where than to ask them where they want to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.979" offset="21807313">If you draw a zone line, you're going to take a census and find out wherever child in that county lives to know which side of the zone it will go.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.755" offset="21838346">And you're going to still have to get his part together, a form from him to determine his age and his name and all the other factors that school officials always get from children when they go to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.349" offset="21916818">The question was asked me in opening about the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.895" offset="21930924">Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.980" offset="21931342">It was not asked to me, it was asked Mr. Tucker about the faculty in the -- to the comparative faculty in New Kent County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.273" offset="21960495">We don't have a breakdown of the entire faculty in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.633" offset="21973870">There's a breakdown of the faculty that's been employed for the last five years and by way of comparison on the 11 White teachers who had been employed, five of them do not have a collegiate degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.121" offset="22027891">Three of them have a BS degree, one has a Bachelor of Music and two have BA so we have six with bachelor's degrees and five with no degrees and of the college teachers, there are nine with bachelor's degrees, five BA degrees, five of BS degrees and one with no degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.535" offset="22105527">So, of the 16 Negro teachers hired only one does not have a degree and of the 11 White teachers hired, five have no degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.212" offset="22148263">I also would like to point out that the statistics in the record as to the overcrowding of the schools and the teacher capacities were figures as of three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.857" offset="22190791">With 115 colored children moving into the White school, the pupil-teacher ratio at the colored school is now less than that at the school which has just been integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.984" offset="22235303">We just submit in closing Your Honors that we come here under the Fourteenth Amendment and unless this Court is prepared to go beyond anything that has been conceived that it said in Brown unless it is prepared to say that when we spoke in Goss and said that if you had a completely free choice, that would be an entirely different case because neither the parents or the children could choose free of racial consideration unless you are in fact prepared to write an affirmative command in the Fourteenth Amendment, freedom of choice must stand as a constitutional answer to the command of Brown.</text>

            <text syncTime="5590.416" offset="22465076">I would be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.599" offset="22477720">On page 14 of our brief of the respondent, the relief sought in the lower court is copied therein and it was to the -- to have the City of Jackson stop excluding these plaintiffs from entering the Jackson High School, elementary -- Alexander Elementary and other similar schools and that is the summary judgment that was granted by the District Court to stop excluding these people form these schools and we have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.105" offset="22611780">Now, there are two points brought up by the Solicitor General that provoked me to make a short rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.178" offset="22648038">The -- the argument that I'm starting to make listening carefully that racial mixing is required in the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.534" offset="22681475">He concluded the statement by saying that was not he meant and he said that freedom of choice is not unconstitutional per se, provided the freedom -- provided that choice is exercised in a predetermined way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5660.202" offset="22744168">In other words, if these people exercise their choice in accordance with the plan which the Government has in mind for them, that that is alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.753" offset="22782412">If they do not so exercise it in that direction then it's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.196" offset="22800175">Well now, that is no freedom whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.397" offset="22812923">We have given to these people, to these parents I expect this more reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.182" offset="22832149">We have given to the parents, the right to determine under our transfer plan to where that child will go to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.964" offset="22867257">Now, in this Court, we seek to take that right away from that parent who is only here as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.886" offset="22898918">It -- I think it's alright to bring them here as a class when you're trying to give them rights but now we seek that right away from these parents which has been held by this Court to be a fundamental principle of our government that the parent has the right of control of the rearing of his child.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.197" offset="22972165">So now we will take that away from that parent who is not even in this Court except perhaps as a member of a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.774" offset="22998497">We think that is carrying the class doctrine too far and finally, I want to make this point that there has been in many cases, some effort to make a distinction between the de jure segregation and de facto segregation and I've heard it argued here today that segregation which results from housing patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.540" offset="23089507">Well now, that's alright but now if it's something that occurred in the state that had a statute requiring segregation at the time of Brown then it's up to the School Board to do something more than just eliminate that segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.204" offset="23168188">Now, I want to ask this Court one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.756" offset="23182399">If you are in a de facto segregated area in say New York City just to pick an example, how can you get out?</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.761" offset="23234435">You are there by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.126" offset="23243839">You have no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.286" offset="23252511">You must go to a segregated school and that's alright so they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.431" offset="23285112">In the City of Jackson, Tennessee, if you are in a segregated school, you get out by signing your name and I ask the Court which really gives to the individual the greatest choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="5820.534" offset="23385527">In the moment remaining, I like just to make several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.280" offset="23396498">I think these cases come down to several propositions among which I think the most prominent one is of whether or not a school system has disestablished segregation when it continues to remain in existence, the all Negro school which is the symbol of the segregated system in circumstances when steps can be taken -- quite reasonable steps can be taken to end that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.890" offset="23502973">Secondly, I would like to address myself to perhaps just for the moment to the proposition that has been mentioned several times today, the possibility that something like free choice may be a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.423" offset="23561070">If that is so, it's certainly has not been articulated previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.222" offset="23584266">It certainly appears nowhere explicitly in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.733" offset="23598268">And finally, if it were the case, it would totally upset the administration of school systems throughout the county because most of them traditionally for generations have operated upon a basis of assigning children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.047" offset="23643512">Finally, I may be permitted a personal reference that was a quotation from race relations in American law and it's to that where some reference to statements out of context I might say I did not know then what I know now.</text>

            <text syncTime="5919.589" offset="23781752">I might not have written that section of the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.256" offset="23788440">Now, I think I would have written it but I would have stated things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.981" offset="23803277">Actually, I think it is somewhat out of context but I would not have written anything susceptible to such an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.713" offset="23834206">Finally, this entire question of flight in connection with this proposition being raised in the brief, we did a bit of research on just how many majority school districts there are in United States or at least in the region of the country that would be affected by this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5948.491" offset="23897318">Of the approximately 6,000 school district's in the seventeen sovereign and border states, 303 approximately 5% have Negro student majorities and even smaller percentage have 60% Negro student bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.129" offset="23955937">So the matters, as a practical matter, are not of any great consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.819" offset="23974640">As a matter of principle, however, it invokes the considerations and the statement of the Brown case that hostility may not be grounds for refusing to abide by this decision, reiterated in Cooper against Aaron and ultimately the proposition of when this Court expounds the Constitution, it states a proposition and the principle which is a practical matter at any given moment may not be actually attainable but something that we at least want to work towards and that proposition as I see Brown is official being one country rather than two and that we should not acquiesce in various schemes and devices to frustrate the principle of the Brown decision which I think is perhaps the greatest thing ever to happen -- to come out of this Court in the history of the nation.</text>
