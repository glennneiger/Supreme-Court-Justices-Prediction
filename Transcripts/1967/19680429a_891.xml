            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- 891, W. Willard Wirtz, Secretary of Labor, United States Department of Labor, petitioner versus Hotel, Motel and Club Employees Union, Local Number 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.460" offset="221184">Mr. Weinstein.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="30.870" offset="226826">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.484" offset="245321">This case comes to the Court on the writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.823" offset="278653">It began when the petitioner, the Secretary of Labor sued in the District Court in the Southern District of New York to set aside an election that the respondent, a local union held in May 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.757" offset="350438">The issues arise under Title IV of the Labor Reform Law of 1959 which is commonly known as the Landrum-Griffin Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.513" offset="397458">As the Court knows, the scheme of that title is to set forth in one elaborate section, Section 401, a variety of conditions and requirements that are applied to the union elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.019" offset="463496">The first issue in this case involves one of those requirements drawing out of a provision of Section 401(e) which is contained in the appendix to our brief towards the top of page 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.700" offset="534131">That provision, Section 401(e), among other things deals with qualifications that a union may impose upon those who wish to be candidates for elective office.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.354" offset="580838">And it says that all members in good standing shall be eligible subject to and this is the pertinent statutory language, “reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="132.933" offset="635068">The respondent applied what the district judge has called a prior office holding requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.784" offset="662549">It required those who wish to be candidates for anyone of the 31 paid full-time positions open in the May 1965 election, to have previously been members of the body of the union called its assembly which existed since 1951 or instead to have been members of a body called all the old Shop Delegates Council which existed before 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.007" offset="775398">Our contention which the District Court accepted and the majority of the Court of Appeals rejected is that this is an unreasonable requirement within the intention of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.155" offset="823986">The second issue before the Court grows out of the procedures established in Section 402 for remedying defective elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.107" offset="859826">That section sets up a multistage procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.387" offset="876962">The union member who is dissatisfied must exhaust internal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.370" offset="892844">He complains to the Secretary, the Secretary investigates and then if he thinks it warranted, if the union has not taken voluntary action, he bring suit to set aside the election and to seek the relief of a new election under his supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.620" offset="957837">The second problem here goes to the conditions the statute prescribes as the requisite to the grant of the relief of a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.769" offset="1002454">The statutory language is in Section 402(c) which is towards the bottom of page 42 of our brief, and it says that the election shall not be set aside unless the District Court finds that a violation of Section 401 may have affected the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.123" offset="1091897">The District Court here held that even though the prior office holding requirement wasn't its view unreasonable, it could not say that the imposition of that requirement may have affected the outcome of the election and we contest that ruling here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.501" offset="1161383">There's a third question that need not be reached if the first two are answered in the Secretary's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.395" offset="1196910">And this was a question akin to that previously decided by this Court this term in the Local 125 of the Laborer's Union case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.092" offset="1235780">It goes to the relationship that must exist between the charges the Secretary makes in Court and those that union member makes in his complaint to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.843" offset="1286771">Here, the union members complained only with the prior office holding requirement, both within the union and to the Secretary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="304.301" stopTime="310.272">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="304.301" offset="1320626">The second question was not report in here (Inaudible).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="310.272" stopTime="647.425">
            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="310.272" offset="1344449">That's correct, Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.475" offset="1349256">There was a concurring opinion in the Court of Appeals resting solely on that second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.954" offset="1379140">The Secretary in his investigation believed he had uncovered evidence of three additional violations of Section 401 committed in connection with this election going to the fact that some officers were appointed rather than elected an alleged lack of timely notice of election districts and alleged interference with voters at the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.749" offset="1466389">The district judge struck these allegations on the ground that the union members have not complained upon and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.402" offset="1509021">There's also a fourth question which has been interposed, I believe, for the first time in respondent's brief in this Court and we have not dealt with it in our brief and I will after stating the facts and this is an argument that because the respondent has changed his prior office holding requirement and plans to hold a new election about three weeks from now that this case is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.694" offset="1618108">Now, if I may, I should like to turn to the facts of this case which are rather complex because of the complex organization that this union has given its government.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.083" offset="1679653">The union represents, at least to the time of the May 1965 election, approximately 27,000 people employed in hotels, motels and private clubs in the New York City area.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.003" offset="1743391">I believe it covered all boroughs except Staten Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.704" offset="1762200">The union for purposes of its internal government is divided into seven districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.954" offset="1787173">Six of these are geographic and each of the geographic districts covers all of the hotels and motels within its boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.361" offset="1832835">The Seventh District covers all of the private clubs within the union's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.145" offset="1863973">The union, both with -- the union as a whole within the district's -- within each hotel or motel or club is divided into departments or craft units and there are basically five of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.642" offset="1929906">The housekeeping workers, the kitchen workers, the dining room workers, the banquet workers and bar workers, each have a department, a craft organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.914" offset="1979016">And then within each hotel, this craft organization is reflected in the composition of the shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.110" offset="2003780">Each dining room is a shop, each banquet room, each bar and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.031" offset="2035545">Now, the general organization of the overall government of the union is somewhat complex and the hope that it might aid rather than add to confusion, I've had prepared a rather summary chart of the union's overall government and ask the clerk to distribute it to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.534" offset="2145468">And if I may before coming back to the craft organization, I'd like to describe the people who are listed on this chart and how they are chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.400" offset="2193011">Because it is only the people listed on this chart who, since 1951, have been eligible to run for the full-time paid positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.089" offset="2243688">At the top of the union, their major officers are four general officers, the president, the secretary treasure, the general organizer and the recording secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.641" offset="2297919">These are elected by the membership at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.130" offset="2319862">Next, there are seven vice presidents who are elected from the seven districts that I mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.049" offset="2347551">One from each and each vice president is essentially the presiding officer of his district.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.903" offset="2379003">Now, there is a provision for other vice presidents to be appointed by the assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.854" offset="2406797">The record is silent on when this provision whether this provision has ever been invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.865" offset="2426859">The respondent asserts that is not and we know of no evidence to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.415" offset="2445040">But the provision is intended to allow other vice presidents to be appointed by the assembly for the purpose of making sure that there is at least one vice president from each of the crafts.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.484" offset="2505331">Then, there are 10 delegates to the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.197" offset="2532185">These are appointed from the -- by and from the assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.137" offset="2551933">Generally, the record says, they also hold elective positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.444" offset="2573145">The Trades Council that they belong to, represents a multiple of unions and group bargainings with the hotels and motels within their jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.066" offset="2611597">Now, those who I have mentioned up to this point compose the administrative board of the union and the union's president testified below that these are the people who on a day-to-day basis run the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.440" offset="2681083">Now, in composing--</text>

            <text syncTime="647.425" offset="2693099">But I gather -- did you say Mr. Weinstein that there were 10 delegates and seven vice presidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.583" offset="2721729">This would look as though the administrative board should be 21 --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="658.624" offset="2737821">And you said the fact that they're less than that because some of the delegates are also --</text>

          <turn speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="662.816" stopTime="780.705">
            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="662.816" offset="2754644">Yes, that's correct, Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.233" offset="2760286">I didn't intend to give any other impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.566" offset="2769586">It can vary up to 21 but our understanding is it is not and it could be as few as 11 if all 10 were either Vice President or a general officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.924" offset="2823084">The next basic group in the union is the executive board which meets on a monthly basis and its voting members constitute the members of the administrative board plus about 50 other members.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.036" offset="2895496">These 50 other members are chosen from the overall assembly at a rate of one man for every 500 union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.515" offset="2937396">Now, in 1965, 27,000 union members would have meant 54 other voting members of the administrative board.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.813" offset="2978670">In addition, all of the union's business agents are nonvoting members of the executive board.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.502" offset="3005419">They can sit, they have a voice but they do not vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.142" offset="3023914">20 business agents are elected and I've noticed that our brief in page, top of page 4 inadvertently says 31 and it should read 20 there.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.332" offset="3072711">They are elected from the seven districts into which the union is divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.072" offset="3099669">In addition, the assembly may appoint as many other business agents as it thinks desirable or necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.666" offset="3146062">While the record shows that some other had been appointed, it does not show the précised number.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.429" offset="3177096">These people, together with all elected assembly -- other assembly members, compose the union's assembly, the basic body that makes a man eligible to run for office.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="792.292" offset="3272495">It began -- the basic plan, as it now exist, Mr. Justice Harlan began in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.856" offset="3306768">There was previously a body called the Shop Delegates Council which filled the function of the assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.041" offset="3327561">Now, it may be that there was also an executive board and administrative board at that time but before 1951, as I should come in a moment if I may, what a man had to do to become eligible to run for office is somewhat different than he's had to do since 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.584" offset="3397674">These other assembly members are approximately 325, 350.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.726" offset="3422229">There are about a total of 400 assembly members including the 50 who sit on the executive board.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.699" offset="3446157">They are chosen from one, two or three election districts within each of the seven districts at a rate of one assembly man for each 75 union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.855" offset="3498820">Now, the full-time paid positions on this chart are essentially three groups, which are four general officers, seven vice presidencies, the 20 business agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.500" offset="3557334">A person who wished to run for one of those offices in May 1965 had to satisfy the prior office holding requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.093" offset="3595786">He did not have to satisfy that requirement to be appointed say as an additional business agent or to run for any of the other positions listed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.757" offset="3638418">Now, the union as well, as I indicated earlier, has a craft structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.270" offset="3664436">Each shop within each hotel or motel or club, at least I think it has five or more members, elects its own representative called the ‘shop delegate' or the ‘department delegate' variously, who fills the function of shop steward.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.323" offset="3728697">He is essentially the leader of that shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.576" offset="3745625">Before 1951, there was a group that is now referred to as the old Shops Delegate Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.186" offset="3780106">Every shop delegate or steward who held such a position before 1951 belong to that council.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.996" offset="3815320">However, when the assembly was created, shop -- being a shop delegate did not qualify one for the assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.727" offset="3846248">So in consequence, if a man was a shop delegate or steward before 1951, he is eligible to run for one of the full-time paid positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.116" offset="3887835">On the other hand, if he has had that position since 1951 and only since 1951, that does not give him eligibility for paid position.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.991" offset="3935378">The shop delegates, the stewards however, have a variety of functions within the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.003" offset="3963382">For example they process grievances at initial levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.303" offset="3980622">They also represent the shop members a variety of functions in the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.812" offset="5238575">Now, the net result in this election was that the membership party ran two candidates for general officer; these were for president and general organizer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.716" offset="7106226">But I assume what they mean in the context of the facts of this case is that a union may seek by a rule to eliminate people without experience from being candidates and that any rule that is logically calculated to eliminate the inexperienced is a reasonable one or appropriate one under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.795" offset="7214582">The case I guess could be disposed of on their grounds because the facts, I don't think, would meet their standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.654" offset="7449997">The record shows that the attendance is very sparse if the union applied its own rule that would eject any assembly member who missed two consecutive meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.504" offset="7505377">The record shows that some two thirds of the assembly members would have been eliminated from the assembly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.339" offset="7684681">Now, appointment they say means election by the assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.700" offset="7702131">But in practice, the union president testified that he couldn't remember anytime an assembly -- the assembly rejected any recommendation of the other bodies and I assume that goes to appointments of business agents as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.664" offset="7770049">The record shows for example that the union ran a class in the early ‘60s with about a hundred union members attended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.805" offset="7910588">In fact, the record shows that one of these two people who is discussed, one of them was appointed before the 1962 election at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.762" offset="7950399">He did not run in the 1962 election but he was then reappointed as business agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.949" offset="7971192">He then run and was elected in the 1965 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.181" offset="7992090">But we don't think that the case can be disposed of so readily because we think the legal standard that the respondent in the amicus suggests they're simply wrong but it doesn't reflect what the Congress had in mind in requiring only reasonable qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.277" offset="8068472">The purpose as Congress has said repeatedly and this Court has said of Title IV is to assure democratic procedures in the government of unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.589" offset="8121762">It's to assure that union officers periodically must go back to the membership for a mandate and that the membership had a reasonable opportunity to contest with the incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.563" offset="8189576">And we suggest that any approach to this case has got to be bottomed on a recognition that the essential governing feature has got to be “what is the freedom of choice open to the union members who wish to oppose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.313" offset="8256658">Is it reasonably possible for any opposition group within the union to mount an opposition slate and put the choice to the good sense and the good judgment of the union electorate during and after a campaign?</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.130" offset="8339937">In approaching these cases with this thesis, the Secretary has developed a variety of criteria in his administration that he has proposed to the courts as a foundation for decision of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.159" offset="8412035">And the courts until the decision of the Second Circuit in this case have generally agreed that these are the pertinent condition, the things to be considered in determining reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.219" offset="8460204">First, because of the congressional emphasis of what is democratic and what is not and that this election should be democratic, the Secretary has advanced the idea that a principle reference must be made to those conditions that are opposed in the polity of country generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.694" offset="8562186">In sense, what sorts of requirements are generally accepted in democratic elections as they're known here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.190" offset="8592175">Now, we would think that on this basis, it's doubtful that any prior office holding requirement can be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.061" offset="8619656">It's just too foreign to the type of procedures that American democracy has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.908" offset="8651003">But we don't make the argument that such a per se rule should be adopted and we don't think that it's necessary for the disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.703" offset="8694157">For example, there's a variety of other criteria that we have advanced and the courts have considered and under all of them, we think that the union requirement in this case has to be disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.343" offset="8756746">As I indicated before in response to Justice Harlan, the requirement in this case disqualifies some 93% or 94% of the union membership from running for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.657" offset="8817977">With this type of disqualification when of the 7% such a substantial number have not been active in the assembly or the general government since 1951 when another large group is taken up by the administration slate in this or any other election because incumbents are -- a large number of incumbents are generally re-nominated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.442" offset="8913168">How possibly can there be any assurance that a group within the union that wishes to oppose can find candidates who will be allowed to run?</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.169" offset="8964054">They simply cannot when the restriction is this substantial and we suggest that this too makes it unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.738" offset="8994356">Now, another factor which we advance is what the general practice in the labor community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.846" offset="9022777">The Secretary introduced in the District Court a substantial amount of evidence going to the practices of unions generally and there are several exhibits beginning in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.358" offset="9080769">I believe with Exhibit 69 at page 249 that analyzes unions in this country by factors that were thought to make them in some way comparable to local sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.494" offset="9169377">For example, Exhibit 69 analyzes the 120 at large unions in the same business, the local unions and respondents owned international.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.472" offset="9221308">And it show that only about 25% if them have this sort of requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.532" offset="9249520">And then when we go onto the other comparisons, the requirement becomes even less frequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.891" offset="9274911">For example, Exhibit 70 analyzed international unions and this begins on page 258 of the record, international unions having a total membership of 20,000 to 40,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.403" offset="9348995">And this group was chosen because the 20,000 to 40,000 range was somewhat comparable to the 27,000 members and respondents roles and not a single one of the unions in that category had any requirement of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.600" offset="9429765">Then Exhibit 71 which begins on exhibit -- on page 260 analyzed the constitutions of the major national unions in this county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.795" offset="9482533">It analyzed those constitutions of 72 of these unions, I believe, to determine whether a private -- a prior office holding requirement was imposed on the locals within the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.075" offset="9543659">The only such requirement that was found was in the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and that union offered an alternative to prior office holding which was of course sponsored by the union and union management that as far as we know from this record was open to all and everyone who took the course became eligible to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.993" offset="9631326">But as this exhibit shows many locals with membership roles, comparable to these unions, larger than these unions had no such requirement, it just didn't any need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.676" offset="9694124">And the final comparison put in before the District Court which begins on page 260 -- I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.302" offset="9728606">It's the next class on page 266, analyzed national unions and found again with the exception of the Ladies Garment Workers, there was no requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.518" offset="9789419">I believe that I misspoke myself in describing Exhibit 71.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.671" offset="9814079">One of the criteria for selection of large unions there were the receipts and these unions not only are large in membership but they are believed to be the locals in the country that have receipts in excess of $1 million, thus, making them in financial size and presumably a need for financial judgment comparable to this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.156" offset="9899969">So that in total, the evidence showed quite overwhelmingly, we think, that this type of requirement is a very rare beast indeed within the labor movement itself, existing only within a few locals of this international and within the International Ladies Garment Workers Union which has the alternative and the only other thing comparable to this --</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.328" offset="13288678">The statutory language is 402(c) at the bottom of page 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.845" offset="13318771">And it says that before ordering a supervised election, the District Court must find upon a preponderance of the evidence after a trial upon the merits that a violation of Section 401 may have affected the outcome of the particular election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.168" offset="13404035">And the problem here I think is stated narrowly in terms of the statute is what does the phrase ‘may have affected' mean as a legal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.421" offset="13453040">This phrase is the product of a compromised in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.509" offset="13473416">It was not in the Bill in the Kennedy-Ervin bill as originally proposed, the statute read essentially as it does without may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.010" offset="13507375">They're required of finding that the violation of Section 401 affected the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.606" offset="13533811">The Senate inserted the phrase ‘may have’, the House is seated to it in conference and Senator Goldwater in presenting the compromise to the Florida Senate, commented that the purpose of this condition -- this language ‘may have’ was because and I quote that the difficulty of proving such an actuality that is an actuality of effect would be so great as to render the professed remedy practically worthless and we suggest that that has to be the keynote of interpretation and application of the provision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.136" offset="13719907">We would suggest that the moment one person is disqualified from running for office by an unreasonable requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.485" offset="13753344">That may have affected the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.987" offset="13763271">That is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.530" offset="13777481">I think it's a common knowledge that the outcome of an election as influenced by candidates who did not run is always an imponderable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.673" offset="13842056">But it seems to us that that is sufficient to satisfy the statute and here where eight were disqualified by this requirement, where the result was no contest for the vice presidencies, a lesser contest for the general officers, a contest for only two of the business agent positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.480" offset="14517269">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.447" offset="14533151">We respectfully submit that the bylaw in question was entirely reasonable and that the circuit court was correct in its finding that the bylaw was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.292" offset="14592502">We further submit that if this Court should find that the bylaw itself was unreasonable, if the District Court was correct in its finding and in a cessation, that the outcome of the election would in no way have been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.829" offset="14666689">We further submit for the consideration of this Court that the rule laid down by this Court in Bottle Blowers and in the Laborer's case, in no way determine the issue of mootness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.356" offset="14728756">There is one further point which I deal the time to Mr. Gold of the American Federation of Labor to discuss not as the issue of the three matters which were not considered in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.233" offset="14780270">Now, Mr. Weinstein has very carefully and very ably stated to the Court some of the factual background that's rather complex and before I get to the discussion of law on this, I'd like to fill in some aspects of the situation existing in this union long prior to the institution of this case and long prior to the legislation passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.815" offset="14906598">This is a very complex situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.646" offset="14930004">We have problems that arise in the fact when you have a local membership of 26,000 people working for more than 200 different employers spread throughout the City of New York, embracing every type of hotel from such large hotels as the Waldorf-Astoria or the St. Regis down to a hotel having a hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.485" offset="15037315">When you have a situation where you have certain crafts in great number such as the housekeeping department or the dining room department possibly overwhelming the small departments that have a handful of people like a telephone operator or an upholster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.044" offset="15127594">When you have a series of craft unions that have to integrate their work with other craft unions in protecting collective bargaining benefits, you'll have problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.762" offset="15194467">Now, this union was founded almost 30 years ago, two months ago and from its inception, it was dedicated to the concept of this being a rank and file union and runners again rank and file union and the essence of democracy was part and parcel of its construction and part and parcel of its philosophy all the way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.028" offset="15295509">It's a rather unique union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.770" offset="15306480">It's a union which according to the record has achieved for its members the highest standard of wages and working conditions in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.162" offset="15352038">It is a union which has accumulated more than $2.5 million in its direct funds and a share in over $30 million in pension, welfare and medical funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.839" offset="15406686">It is a union where the president of the union, leader of more than 26,000 men earns a salary of $225.00 a week and a maximum of expenses of $45.00 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.392" offset="15480978">It is a union which provides very liberal scholarship funds for the children of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.072" offset="15503653">It is a union which concerns itself with the protection of its members being defrauded by unscrupulous consumer practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.718" offset="15546284">It actively involved in legislation and above all the games which has achieved over the 30-year period of its existence have without a single major strike in the industry because of the unique peace keeping machinery that it has evolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.938" offset="15627160">Now, all of these facts, let it long ago to feel that it must take proper measures to ensure that the union members picks for itself the type of office who are qualified to guide and lead it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.094" offset="15727783">In 1941, the union adopted a rule that was a prior experience rule and incidentally, I must point out to the Court that we are not talking about prior office holding, we're talking about prior union experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.312" offset="15796642">In 1941, which is three years after our union was charged, we have been a very large group of shop delegates and we had a Shop Delegates Council and the Shop Delegates Council basically consisted of the people who are most enthusiastic about union affairs and the proper conduct of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.285" offset="15884518">They were the backbone of -- around which the union organized its organizational job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.522" offset="15913462">And we then made it a condition precedent to holding membership or holding officership in the union that one should have demonstrated some interest in activity in the union by participating in the work of the Shop Delegates Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.816" offset="15998621">In 1951, we found that the Shop Delegates Council method of procedure was unworthy and we amended our bylaws in 1951 so that we have an assembly which could conduct that day-to-day business of the union in place of a membership meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.951" offset="16083153">You must remember that there is no hall large enough, anywhere in New York City where you can have 26,000 people come to the union meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.285" offset="16120560">And if you could have a hall large enough to accommodate 26,000 people, you couldn't conduct union business in that kind of an atmosphere so that we in 1951 established the assembly as the working body to whom the offers were accountable and to whom we could look to union leadership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.977" offset="16231320">Now, this union has peculiar history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.741" offset="16242291">From 1938 the time when it was first chartered down to the present time, elections have been held by secret ballot with voting machines under impartial supervision and honest valid association with opportunity for all members to vote providing they were in good standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.239" offset="16340302">And from 1938 down to the present time, the union administration has been reelected over and over and over again by votes ranging from seven to one to ten to one to sometimes where there has been no opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.092" offset="16411773">Our query is that overwhelming vote of confidence come as a result of a press of tactics, as a result of scheme and a device whereby one avoids the picture -- the clear intent of the congressional legislation or does that overwhelming vote come because the membership is cognizant to the fact that it has achieved such tremendous gains under the leadership.</text>

            <text syncTime="4269.700" offset="17182177">The Government has asked the court to take into consideration the fact that other unions don't have that kind of requirement but that is a prior experience requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.030" offset="17231496">The record shows that there are 40,000 local unions in the United States that report to the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.034" offset="17279457">Out of that 40,000, 200 constitutions were analyzed for the purpose of this case which leave some 39,800 bylaw, sets of bylaws not examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.723" offset="17334314">Further than that, reference is made to 76 international constitutions of which only one IOTW contains a prior office holding requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.591" offset="17385723">Our international union, the hotel international is listed as one of those organizations or internationals which doesn't have a prior office holding requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.662" offset="17438072">Yet, the record shows here that 25% or more of the local unions in our international union which does not have a prior office holding or a prior experience requirement do have a rule somewhat similar to ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.275" offset="17520515">In other words, sensible and I say somewhat similar prior experience requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.018" offset="17539427">In other words, an analysis of the record shows how unreliable a guide, an analysis of 200 local bylaws may be or the international bylaws maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.946" offset="17591150">In other words, we can't rely on statistics alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.196" offset="17616123">We have to take into consideration, what is the situation which confronts the union that's in the court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="4388.041" offset="17655515">Was it because there was a sinister purpose by a group of people to perpetuate themselves in office?</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.768" offset="17682474">Did they have knowledge of the fact that Congress is going to pass legislation in 1959 and how could they circumvent legislation or was it related to a genuine desire of the rank and file members of the union to see that a union is large and is complex as this and as many problems they had, govern themselves properly.</text>

            <text syncTime="4472.316" offset="17992600">Now, it's at least arguable that the burden is very heavy on a union to show that anything that results in members in good standing not being eligible to be a candidate is within the intendment of this phrase, ‘reasonable qualification.’</text>

            <text syncTime="5139.081" offset="20659702">First, it was an experience of qualification but we dispense of it because when the Secretary call to our attention, this issue was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.756" offset="20702438">We conducted a very exhaustive examination of our records to the first time since 1951 to see what the factual situation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.068" offset="20747682">And we found that there was a pool of 1700 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.946" offset="20763146">We paid for the experts that came in, we analyze the records, we cooperated with the Secretary and we did everything that we could because we wanted to know what's right and what's wrong and we said that 1700 for 31 offices are certainly reasonable but then the question came up, what's going to happen five years from now?</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.750" offset="20838379">What's going to happen 10 years from now?</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.925" offset="20847052">A lot of people will pass out of the union scene because of death, illness, retirement, attrition generally and we might be left with a situation that would be completely unreasonable and the question came and I'm very frank to state to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.846" offset="20918732">Some people said that if we amend our bylaws now, it might be a confession of weakness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.647" offset="20946004">On the other hand, our union leadership said nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.297" offset="20956557">We run this union for the benefit of the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.450" offset="20973171">If we have a situation that should be correct for the future, let's correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.152" offset="20991979">So in December of 1966, we did what we've done many, many times in the past, and that is amend our bylaws so that it would be not only in consonance with the spirit of legislation and the spirit of good trade unionism but with the letter as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.425" offset="21065122">And so we amended our bylaws in December of 1966 of the next election which is going to take place two weeks from now will be conducted under a situation where there will be a pool of 17,000 people eligible to be nominated for office.</text>

            <text syncTime="5989.098" offset="24059800">Nonetheless, the heavy vote in favor of the administration candidates is convincing that the existence and enforcement of the bylaw could not have affected the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.293" offset="24108596">The evidence satisfies me that the primary reason for the heavy vote in favor of the administration was a lack of any real grievance or issue against the union management.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.614" offset="24157811">The platform of the opposition membership party did not charge any abuses or misconduct or even any inefficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.427" offset="24201070">There was no attempt to state any specific complaints.</text>

            <text syncTime="6212.576" offset="24953710">I think that you cannot read out of the statute the clear words may have affected the outcome of the election and the burden of the Secretary can prove that by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.302" offset="25000626">The Secretary is asking this Court my opinion to give a construction to the statute which would completely nullify the words which the Congress was so careful to put into it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6871.245" offset="27588315">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6875.284" offset="27604511">While Mr. Cohn has gone very deeply into the reasonable rule aspect of the case here, he has very properly addressed himself to the specifics of the situation of this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6887.675" offset="27654040">I would like to divide the few minutes that I have between the slightly broader consideration of that and then turn to the exhaustion of remedies question touched down by Mr. Weinstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="6899.347" offset="27700746">The AFLCIO supported the enactment of the present Title IV and also supported its precursor in the Kennedy-Ervin bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6908.808" offset="27738572">It did so because as Mr. Cohn has noted, in the Glass Bottle Blowers case, this Court concluded that Title IV was a carefully limited piece of legislation which took proper account of the institutional interest of the unions, of membership responsibility and of the complex dynamics in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6938.359" offset="27856854">It did so moreover because Congress carried out that determination by utilizing existing union constitutions as a basic governing law in this area and by legislating interstitially within the framework they provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.110" offset="27915786">Indeed, in following this principle, Congress went to the extent of deferring to union constitutions in the situation in which the claim to their legitimacy is at its weakest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6964.830" offset="27962702">For even when the Secretary runs a rerun election, he must do so, so far as it's lawful and practical in conformity with the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="6980.665" offset="28026023">It did so in short because the Congress recognize and gave substance to the values of union autonomy and membership responsibility and because Congress did not strip union members of their right to evolve the constitutional system responsive to their need.</text>
            <text syncTime="6997.577" offset="28093628">We believe that it is this background which gives the answer part to a question raised by Mr. Justice Fortas as to whether the very structure of Section 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="7009.349" offset="28140753">He doesn't indicated that a union has a heavy burden upon it when it passes a rule in defense that is reasonable and the other major labor enactment of course is the National Labor Relations Act and in considering a proviso to Section 8(a)(3) which prohibits discrimination that permits union security agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="7030.618" offset="28225808">This Court in Machinist Local versus Labor Board 362 U.S. stated, “It is common place but one to easily loss sight of that labor legislation traditionally entails the adjustment and compromise a competing interest which in the abstract from the purely partisan point of view may seem irreconcilable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7052.973" offset="28315251">The policy of the Act is embodied in the totality of that adjustment and not necessarily in any single demand which may have figured however weightily in it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7063.918" offset="28359032">It's for this reason that we believe that the purpose of the reasonable qualification rule is to ensure that union members and their concern with the institutional interest of their union, do not place onerous burdens on member who wishes to run for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="7082.619" offset="28433847">We submit that the alternate inquiry should be whether it's fair to ask a member to undertake the test the rule sets out as a predicate for eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="7093.706" offset="28478151">So this reason that we believe that the rule here is proper which asked that a man maintain good standing for one year and then submit himself to the members in his district and seek their support as an assembly member.</text>
            <text syncTime="7109.410" offset="28541053">We don't believe that that is onerous or difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="7112.529" offset="28553488">We believe that it is clearly directed toward a legitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="7118.146" offset="28575953">And we believe further that since the ultimate issue is fairness, since the ultimate issue is the individual member's right to take advantage of the opportunity to run for office that the percentage test which figures so heavily in the administration of this Act and which Mr. Weinstein stressed that points to the exclusion of the other criteria that the Secretary brought out, don't tell us anything about whether the rule is reasonable or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="7331.003" offset="29427336">We think therefore in practical terms the Secretary's argument here results in the proposition, that union democracy can only be achieved if unions are limited to eligibility rules which allow any member in good standing to run for office even though he has no experience and/or knowledge of union affairs even though he has demonstrated no prior interest in those affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="7354.356" offset="29520750">This argument is explicitly grounded on a dichotomy between membership action and passing eligibility rules and membership action which takes the form of casting a ballot in a general election.</text>
