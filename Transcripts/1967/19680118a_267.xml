            <text syncTime="6.769" offset="130487">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.810" offset="142608">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming an order of the District Court of the District of Montana, which dismissed the complaint in the government's action under the civil provisions of the False Claims Act against the respondent, Neifert-White Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.323" offset="232678">Respondent is a corporation which acts as a dealer in grain storage bins.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.914" offset="251068">The complaint in this action charged or alleged that, on 12 separate occasions in 1959, respondent engaged and made sales to various individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.365" offset="304880">These sales were financed by loans obtained from the Commodity Credit Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="328391">According to the applicable regulations of the Commodity Credit Corporation, the corporation was authorized to issue loans on storage facilities in an amount not to exceed 80% of the purchase price of that facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.633" offset="389935">The complaint in this action alleged that, in each of the 12 instances referred to, the respondent submitted to the Commodity Credit Corporations false invoices which fraudulently stated and inflated the purchase price of the bins in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.723" offset="466213">The result of this fraud being that, in each of the 12 instances, the Commodity Credit Corporation was caused to issue loans which were, in fact, in access of 80% of the purchase price that was actually paid by the purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.319" offset="528697">In dismissing the complaint in this action, the -- and in affirming that dismissal, the court below ruled that a loan application is not a claim within the meaning of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.616" offset="593795">Therefore, the only and the sole issue presented by this case with this Court's decision is whether or not a loan application is a claim within the meaning of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.427" offset="637053">It is the Government's position that it is and that the court below was in error in narrowly construing the provisions of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.538" offset="673520">The relevant statutory language appears at page 2 of the Government's brief and, without reading all of that language, further Court-- the key language in this statute which is of concern here is that the statute applies to any claim upon or against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.785" offset="750529">The Government's position that that language means -- what the Court referred to -- this Court referred to in United States v. McNinch when it said that the conception of a claim against the Government, and this language appears at page 10 in our brief, the Court said, “the conception of a claim against the government normally connotes a demand for money over some transfer of property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="186.728" offset="850317">That is the test which we submit should be applied to determine whether or not there has been a claim against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.650" offset="878007">Is the applicant seeking the payment of government funds for the transfer of government property?</text>
            <text syncTime="202.004" offset="911339">We think that the construction that we urge is consistent with the legislative purpose in enacting the False Claims Act that it is supported by the language of the statute, is in line with the cases decided by this Court and, in addition, that the standard set down by the court below, whether or not there is an assertion of a legal right, is not a meaningful standard which can be clearly applied by either the Justice Department or the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.915" offset="1042996">Looking first at the language of the statute --</text>

          <turn speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="241.182" stopTime="291.593">
            <label>Mr. John S. Martin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="241.182" offset="1068074">Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, the answer to that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.168" offset="1088031">The Courts -- this is the first case to come before this Court and also in the Courts of Appeals where the question of whether or not a loan is a claim within the meaning of the False Claims Act has been expressly considered by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.324" offset="1152711">It has, in a number of cases, three cases appear in -- that came before this Court, United States v. Rainwater, United States v. Cato, and United States v. Toepleman were here before this Court and the issue raised in those cases was whether the Commodity Credit Corporation was the United States within the meaning of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.527" offset="1237452">Implicit in the holding that sustained an action under the False Claims Act against those defendants was that a loan is a claim.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>

            <text syncTime="296.626" offset="1289906">It was not, Mr. Justice White, except -- with this exception, that the word -- the meaning of the word “claim” was argued in a slightly different context in a companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.919" offset="1335045">You had Cato and Toepleman were decided in the opinion of the Court in United States v. McNinch.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.914" offset="1359078">McNinch involved an application for credit insurance.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="317.170" stopTime="322.268">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="317.170" offset="1372035">Well, did the Court in those cases disaffirm the idea that it had to be a legal right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_s_martin_jr" startTime="322.268" stopTime="544.241">
            <label>Mr. John S. Martin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="322.268" offset="1392410">Well, the Court did not expressly deal with that question, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.792" offset="1418533">It did, as I just quoted in the Court's language in McNinch, and I think important in that is what Mr. Justice Black writing for the Court said in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.160" offset="1456044">He said that, in dealing with McNinch which was the case involving an application for credit insurance and the government was arguing that case that the application for credit insurance was a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.872" offset="1498885">And, Mr. Justice Black, speaking for the Court in that case, said that, normally, the term “claim,” this language is again in our brief at page 10, he recognized that, literally, the term “claim” could be considered to cover and I am quoting the assertion of “a right or privilege to draw upon the government's credit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="369.886" offset="1582895">So, he recognized in that case that the term “claim” could have that reached under literal application, but he said in McNinch that the problem was that there was no demand for immediate transfer of government funds or government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.885" offset="1642872">And, the Court said in a footnote in the McNinch opinion that we will leave to another day the question of what happens when there has been a default on the loan the Government is required to payout, whether that, in that context, becomes a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.086" offset="1699715">So that, the -- I do think that these cases have some value because the question of what was a claim was at issue, although in a different context, and no one ever dispute it, either the attorneys or the Court, that an application for a loan was a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.836" offset="1766693">We think that the construction that we urge is consistent with the legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.648" offset="1789994">The Court made clear in McNinch and it had said in US ex rel. Marcus v. Hess that a claim-- that the purpose of the False Claims Act was to protect the public treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.749" offset="1834402">Certainly, in the type with as many government loan programs that we have today, this is an important method in which the public treasury can be depleted by fraudulent loan applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.948" offset="1899186">Just to point out the statistics in the Commodity Credit Corporation alone, that last year they issued approximately $1.4 billion with loans on crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.856" offset="1954774">The grains -- the storage facility program resulted in the issuance of approximately $15 million worth of loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.552" offset="1977553">These are only two of the Government's loan programs and, we submit, as we said in our brief, that these government loan funds are entitled to the protection of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.581" offset="2021648">I would also point out to the Court that counsel has stated in his brief that the government does not need the protection of the False Claims Act because it -- civil provisions because it does have the criminal provisions of Section 1001 of Title 18, and that any false claim in a loan application for a statement of loan application would be covered by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.583" offset="2113703">However, I do think the statutory framework sets up a range of possible alternative action the government could take.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.827" offset="2146722">Criminal action is one, but there are a number of cases where there may be false statements contained in loan applications or other types of claims where it's a single instance, it's relatively minor, where perhaps the invocation of criminal sanctions is too severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.478" offset="2213282">It seems to us that the forfeiture provisions of the False Claims Act provide the Government with a reasonable alternative way of proceeding in that type of case, and so that this does perform a fairly substantial function.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.292" offset="2392586">Now, as I stated, we think that our reading of the statute comports with the intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.070" offset="2451623">We also think that the rule which the court below laid down is really not a meaningful test.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.048" offset="2475551">To say that the False Claims Act will apply where there is an assertion of a legal right leads to the question what does that mean in the context of this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="603.769" offset="2518497">These applications -- these loan applications were submitted under what we conceded below.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.912" offset="2550993">I want to privies my remarks by saying we conceded below the person making a loan application could not go into Court and force the Commodity Credit Corporation to make the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.084" offset="2599685">There are, to a certain extent, some discretionary factors to be considered by the Commodity Credit Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.604" offset="2621837">One, is there a need for the facility that is set out in the regulations?</text>
            <text syncTime="634.042" offset="2639496">But, at the same time, we concede it was not an enforceable right, in that, you could not go into Court to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.026" offset="2667499">I would refer the Court to the language of the statute establishing the Commodity Credit Corporation, and that's set forth in a footnote at page 11 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.118" offset="2751822">The Commodity Credit Corporation views this as an expressed intent of Congress, that such loans shall be granted where the applicant otherwise qualifies so that there is, in a real sense, a right conferred on the farmer to apply for this type of loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.462" offset="2825174">And, the Commodity Credit Corporation views it at -- as the duty of the corporation to make the loan where the farmer otherwise qualifies.</text>

Cohn at 270 Montana which I believe to be the first false claim decision decided by this Court, said that this is not a claim situation because it does not involve a claim for money or property to which a right is asserted against the Government based on the Government's liability to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.424" offset="4465037">Now, since 1926, that has been the accepted definition of what is a claim under the False Claims Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.453" offset="4533164">The Government argues against this interpretation and says Cohn is no longer of importance because of Marcus v. Hess.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.114" offset="4679868">Because of the fraud practiced by the contractors, the Government money was paid out, but to hold that that is not a claim situation because the contractors could not sue the Government would be to say that the Government could back off at any time from paying the municipalities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.997" offset="4771401">It was a claim situation, and the only thing Marcus v. Hess stands for in that regard is that the False Claims Act touches everyone who causes a false claim to be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.687" offset="8594160">And, as the Court also observed in McNinch, it's not designed to reach every fraud perpetrated upon the Government, and the Cohn definition which is the foundation of the Circuit Court decision has been the accepted definition in all of the false claims decisions since 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.008" offset="8691440">The Government's open door argument, I think, should properly be addressed to Congress rather than to the Court if the Government in fact, in the proliferation of government programs, needs additional sanctions which they can impose civilly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.641" offset="9469889">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.794" offset="9478562">First, I'd address myself to this very question which counsel ended that as a situation of can there be damaged to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.975" offset="9511267">Certainly, there is in the particular situation before the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.612" offset="9533837">There is security of nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.800" offset="9542614">There is some attempt by the local committees to check on that security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.462" offset="9557243">However, the rule which was laid down by the court below would apply to any loan situation and I think that I suppose I'm somewhat onerous by my own experience having been in New York at the time the Salad Oil Scandal broke when the greatest frauds in a country's history was perpetrated in all loan situations as the greatest losses that we've had, I'm sure, in the financial world in the last decade where all loans obvious -- supposedly secured loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.420" offset="9669047">But, in fact, there was no such security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.693" offset="9678137">Now, the Court's reading below would apply to that situation as well as the one we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.926" offset="9699035">I'd also like to address myself to counsel's reliance on the case of United States v. Cohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.530" offset="9725471">As we set forth in our brief, Cohn was a situation which a shipment of cigars that come in from the Philippines, they're being held in a customs house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.314" offset="9768626">These were non-dutiable at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.916" offset="9783045">Cohn procured Cato's so far as out of customs custody by falsely representing that the Bill of Lading hadn't arrived and by falsely procuring a bond that the Bill of Lading would be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.432" offset="9849083">In fact, the Bill of Lading had arrived and it's being held in a bank for payment and he was -- Cohn was supposed to make the payment and then take the Bill of Lading to the Customs people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.994" offset="9883355">So, he procured goods from Custom's custody by use of this false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.305" offset="9904567">However, it was non-dutiable merchandise and the Government had no interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.343" offset="9924733">It was on the basis of those facts because the Government was not dispersing any of its property or its money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.188" offset="9952110">Then, the Court held that there was no claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.521" offset="9961409">I think that is the exact distinction which this Court placed on the Cohn case in U.S. ex rel. Marcus v. Hess and we've set out the language at page 15 whatthe Court in Hess said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.326" offset="10004668">And, I think it applies here also, quoting from Hess, “the situation here is in no sense like that discussed in United States v. Cohn, 270 U.S. 339, 345-347, where the Government acted solely as barely and no person had any claim against it for a payment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.561" offset="10077602">The Court in Co -- in the Cohn case held that there had been no wrongful obtaining of money of the governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.768" offset="10102471">Well, there has been such a wrongful obtaining here on claims which were presented either directly or indirectly to the Government with full knowledge by the claimants of the fraudulent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.235" offset="10144266">I think also significant is the fact that, in US ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, the false statements that were involved, if it were involved, were the fraud that was perpetrated all predated the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.634" offset="10197870">As I read the facts of that case, what happened was that there was a Public Works Administration project proposed and the collusive -- it was collusive bidding which was the fraud involved in Marcus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.924" offset="10267042">So that, the fraud took place before there was any obligation on anyone's part to make any type of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.502" offset="10301419">What happened was there was a collusive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.251" offset="10308420">That was the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.256" offset="10312391">Then, contracts issues binding the local government to make payment for the work done and that was supported through government payments also, but you have very much the situation as Mr. Justice Fortas point out here where the -- you have the fraud then a contract and then payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.545" offset="10397550">Well, here, you have the situation of the loan application, a commitment, and then payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.095" offset="10423777">Now, I agree, Mr. Justice Fortas, with your analysis that, here, there was a binding obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.719" offset="10450213">We also submit to the Court that we don't feel that that distinction should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.524" offset="10477484">We think that whether or not a loan is handled through a commitment procedure or whether the loan, when the loan is approved, the funds are immediately dispersed, whether that should be a controlling difference in the application of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.359" offset="10540805">But, I think that the fact that you do have the situation here where you literally fall within the definition of the court below shows that the rule which the Court set down is not a helpful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.612" offset="10593782">As I said, we feel that the -- a rule that said that any time you're making an application for the payment of government funds, the disbursement of government property, that is a claim against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.430" offset="10645086">All of the programs that we're dealing with, whether or not they involve discretion on the part of the issuing officer where they give him some discretion to determine of the available funds who shall get them or whether there is a need and, even if that discretion is not reviewable in the Court, all of these programs manifest an intent of Congress that, in certain situations, these loans shall issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.538" offset="10761488">And, they place a duty on that officer, who was sworn to enforce the laws of Congress, to make the loans when the situation is right for such a loan to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.670" offset="10814046">So, there is a right in the individual who applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.006" offset="10831391">Whether or not that right may be enforced in the Court of law is another question, but there certainly is a right to the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.393" offset="10860962">And, for all of these reasons, we would ask the Court to adopt the test that we suggest and to reverse the judgment of the court below and reinstate -- order the reinstatement of the complaint.</text>
