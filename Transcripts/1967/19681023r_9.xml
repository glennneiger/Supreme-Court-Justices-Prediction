            <text syncTime="27.673" offset="216127">Mr. Chief Justice Warren and may it please the Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.753" offset="232427">I don't want to re-hash the arguments that we went into last spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.927" offset="249145">But I would like to point out some of the rather unfortunate consequences if the lower court's decision is upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.355" offset="286866">One consequence that was not raised last spring would be the very harsh impact on the liberal welfare benefit states by 42 U.S.C. 603(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="58.212" offset="338275">Now this 1967 Social Security amendment, it's the so called “Freeze Section”, will limit federal matching funds to -- that go to the states to the percentage of children under age 18 that are on AFDC to the total under age 18 population in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.930" offset="433152">In other words, as of January 1, 1968, if the AFDC population under age 18 increases more rapidly than the under age 18 population as a whole, this liberal welfare benefit states will not get one nickel more of federal matching funds to offset this increased burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.702" offset="536179">So when you start with the proposition that states like Connecticut that give decent welfare benefits get only 46% matching funds as against the poor welfare benefits states that get 5-6 or 83%, I think you'll agree this is a rather harsh impact indeed and it follows an article in the New York Times of October 14, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.385" offset="646938">On Page 28, where there was a recent study by the Citizens Budget Commission on what this influx was doing to the liberal welfare benefits states.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.832" offset="700750">For example, in the last eight years from 1959 to the beginning of 1967, Connecticut's AFDC caseload has increased 147%, New Jersey's 287%.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.709" offset="772221">The 10 most liberal welfare benefit states have found their AFDC caseloads and costs skyrocketing while the 10 least liberal welfare benefit states in many cases have actually found their welfare cases decreasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.194" offset="842230">This study further pointed out a, I think, a very fundamental thing that said a low persons don't necessarily migrate into liberal welfare benefit states solely to get on the AFDC roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.835" offset="900744">It was a prime consideration in their move and to quote a humane system of local welfare and a reasonably adequate amount of welfare payments was an important consideration in the movement of persons to the liberal benefit states and I think this observation coincides with the very common sense observation that Mr. Justice Cardozo made back in the early ‘30s in the Helvering case where he said, a system of old age pensions has special dangers of its own if put enforce in one state and rejected in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.532" offset="1051523">The existence of such a system is a bait for the needy and the dependent elsewhere encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose and I think any adverse decision by this Court would have the effect of penalizing every liberal welfare benefit state by putting a premium on the poor benefit state to encourage their needy and dependent to migrate to greener pastures.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.068" offset="2517723">It's a -- it was a Citizens Budget Commission study that was in the New York Times of October 14, 1968 on page 28, Your Honor, and I -- I gave the Clerk's office nine copies so the Court could use it -- be available to them, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.259" offset="2598494">One of the questions that bothered the Court the last time I was here was the -- what reasons, good reasons, can Connecticut give that their statue 17-2D should be found constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.885" offset="2652933">Well, the first basis I think is there was no confident evidence produced by the appellee in this case who bore the burden of proof that the Connecticut legislature arrived at their decision wholly by caprice and without any reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.650" offset="2744048">Secondly, the Connecticut legislature, and we pointed out in our brief, were concerned with the rising welfare costs could not give decent benefits to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.603" offset="2803816">They had their choice that could give to maintain their same high standard with some cut off or they could lower their standard like the other states and I think they wisely chose to follow the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.491" offset="2851359">I think thirdly that the Connecticut Statute itself -- self has a very laudable and salutary purpose of encouraging people to enter the labor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.739" offset="2884378">The Connecticut Statute is unique and different from the other 40 states in this.Connecticut says if you come in the -- the Connecticut and you have a bona fide job offer, if you're willing to work or if you're willing to train for work and it takes a whole year to train, if something happens to you during that time, Connecticut will give you a high standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.460" offset="4167304">I -- I would like to call the Court's attention again to the Edwards case which I noticed that was raised by all the judges and of lower courts and in all the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.247" offset="4226445">One of the strongest arguments I think that Edwards should not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.321" offset="4246716">First, it's our contention if Duncan came into Connecticut under the same circumstances he came to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.125" offset="4277959">At the end of depression, he'd be immediately eligible for welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.647" offset="4287990">But the second case, I think is Sweeney versus The Board of Public Assistance that was decided by the same court in the same term as Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.159" offset="4330099">And in that case, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant board denied her the right to live where she pleased and it was a clear restrain on her liberty of movement in violation of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.320" offset="4378687">The question I think that Mr. Justice Fortas raised, same claim is in the Thompson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.317" offset="4398644">The District Court in that case which was upheld on appeal stated, “There is no arbitrary restraint on the plaintiff's right to live where they please.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.338" offset="4434798">And this Court when out to say something, I think is fundamental in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.471" offset="4451307">It said, “Courts will proceed with great caution before overthrowing the work of such boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.651" offset="4471996">Since their investigation and study have best enabled them to determine what regulations will produce the greatest good for the greatest number,” and that is the fundamental aim of this democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.107" offset="4517867">Now, who should know more about Connecticut's welfare problems than the duly elected legislative subcommittee that recommended 17-2D to the legislature are a two-man majority of the three judge federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.517" offset="4571470">Now, I would like to yield seven minutes of my time to argue on -- amicus argument and the remainder of the time to Mr. Sennett from Pennsylvania for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.503" offset="4651405">Since we were here in May, there have been some further developments along the lines about which we are concern again today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.852" offset="4688812">First, we have had three further amicus curiae briefs filed all in the nature of the same as filed by Legal Aid Societies and OEO attorneys that were here before and again they point out that there is a need, and we all are aware there is a need, for people who are suffering and are in law in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.346" offset="4782853">But this is still not sufficient reason to overlook the fact that this particular ADC program is tied to the residency of people within a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.375" offset="4838964">The states have the local authority, the local legislation, the local administrative power to administer the program within their jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.203" offset="4886194">They can call upon the Federal Government for additional matching funds of certain proportions, if they can qualify by their laws to carry out the -- the provisions of a federal law setting up what they call, state plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.031" offset="4949514">So, I again mentioned as I did before that in spite of the three briefs now filed by the people or your legal aid, the problem is still before us, it is a legislative problem and not a judicial problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.824" offset="5012731">The forum is still wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.964" offset="5025270">There does have been some other developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.618" offset="5035928">The Congress and its provisions 603 of the Social Security Act provides in there that -- and this is before the amendment which we spoke of briefly last time, but now it's enforcing Iowa and in some of the other states called the Wind Program, working set of program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.670" offset="5128088">It's now being operated in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.796" offset="5136656">It has to be operated by July 1 of '69 as to all three phases or no state can qualify any longer for matching funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.222" offset="5178347">But the -- the original act itself in 603 bids and reads this -- reads this way, “Whom children or applicants or recipients of aided family with dependent children are living to attain or retain capabilities for self support or self care which are prescribed by the secretary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.021" offset="5265492">In other words, the goal isn't to dangle welfare in front of people as the ultimate goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.160" offset="5290047">The goal is to help people to earn their living by their own hard labors, teach them, give them training, on the job training, vocational training, help them through their local employment services to take a job immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.270" offset="6938478">I am here on the case of Washington versus Legrant which defers in some respect from the other two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.396" offset="6979020">In that, first, it involves the constitutionality of an act of the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.465" offset="7007232">As distinguished from a state legislative act and at least insofar as Connecticut is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.945" offset="7041191">The District of Columbia statute differs considerably and that it imposes a one year residence requirement across the board to all categories without respect to how much money you may have had when you came into the jurisdiction or any other contingent provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.999" offset="7141397">The question presented is of course whether or not the provision of the District of Columbia Act violates the equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment made apical in the District of Columbia through the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.140" offset="7221959">Now, that the statute makes a classification is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.258" offset="7242439">It distinguishes between those who have been in the District of Columbia for one year and those who have not insofar as eligibility for public assistance is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.587" offset="7299803">The question is of course whether or not this classification is an invidious classification to use the word that this Court has many times used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.034" offset="7345570">Now, I think in answering that question, it is necessary to determine by what standard this classification is to be judged and this Court over the years has hammered out a standard and what I would call an exception to that standard or if you like possibly two standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.458" offset="7439297">The first standard which is the traditional standard, the standard which is applied to legislative classifications in the great majority of the cases provides that the legislative enactment is presumed to be constitutional, that legislatures have a broad scope of discretion in making classifications that the burden is upon the party challenging or attacking the constitutionality of the classification to show that the classification is wholly irrelevant to any conceivable legislative purpose, and that every fact or reason which could support the classification will be presumed, and further that whether or not any of these conceivable or possible legislative purposes that may underlie the statute where the ones, in fact, which prompted their legislature to enact the statute or to use the words of this Court, of course, constitutionally irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.275" offset="7790488">Now, the second standard or what I would call the exception to the general standard is that which has been applied in cases where the classification directly infringes upon a preferred freedom protected by the First Amendment or where the classification is based upon race, color or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.923" offset="7901142">Now under that standard, the classification is immediately suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.398" offset="7938968">I think something very close to a presumption upon constitutionality arises and the burden is upon the government to show that there is a compelling reason for that classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.278" offset="8010543">And even when the government can show a compelling reason, the statute can go no further than is necessary to achieve the legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.069" offset="8069684">Now, I think the answer to the question here is -- depends upon by which standard the District of Columbia Public Assistance Act of 1962 is to be judged.If by the first standard, I think it is clearly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.037" offset="8149619">If by the second standard, then it is probably unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.812" offset="8176682">Now, that the court below applied the exceptional standard, the standard which this Court has applied to First Amendment freedom cases and classifications based upon race is clear, I think, both from the opinion itself, from the statutes or from the cases upon which the court relies, and is of course recognized by appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.021" offset="8289531">Indeed, they urge strongly upon the Court that that is the correct standard and that under that standard, the statute is still constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.275" offset="8342507">Although, they do later retreat to the position that even if the general standard is the proper one, it is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.580" offset="8395692">Now, what conceivable legislative purposes underlie this particular classification?</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.588" offset="8443758">The court below discussed various possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.560" offset="8463611">We would submit that there are at least three which would sustain the constitutionality of the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.181" offset="8498092">Not that these are the only ones or that this is exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.161" offset="8522021">The first of this is to permit the local government to plan its fiscal affairs on a year-to-year basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.618" offset="8571862">Now, that has been argued already before you at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.698" offset="8600179">But I think that is a proper legislative purpose which would support the constitutionality of this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.589" offset="8643751">I might say that I asked the Budget Director of the District of Columbia Department of Public Welfare to prepare some figures and projections as to how the injunction under which the welfare authorities have been since the latter part of last year was affecting the District of Columbia's welfare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.857" offset="8736852">And the Budget Director took the figures both by an average caseload basis and by the monetary sums for the first 10 months of -- first eight months rather of 1968 and compared those to the first 10 months of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.487" offset="8819399">And the figures reflect an increase in the budget of the District of Columbia of about a 110%, substantially, more than double.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.555" offset="8863598">Now, some of that of course may due to a backlog but that's the abolition of this classification in the District of Columbia at least will result in a very substantial increase in the budget is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.124" offset="8941965">The District would then have to do either one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.760" offset="8964430">It would have to increase its budget, find more money or cut down the amount of the grants to the individual recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.931" offset="9013123">Now, the second proper legislative purpose, which we would say underlies the statute, is the protection of -- and -- of fraud, the prevention and detection of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.267" offset="9094520">Now, the appellees, as I understand them, concede that the prevention and detection of fraud is a proper legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.222" offset="9130360">They concede further that the one-year residency requirement is an aid in the accomplishment of that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.496" offset="9163379">They argue, however, that it is not a particularly effective aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.931" offset="9181142">It is not in their view, at least, the most effective or best means of protecting fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.913" offset="9225028">And they invoke again the argument, which has been applied by this court, only to cases within the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.200" offset="9266197">And that is, they say that even if this is true, a proper legislative purpose and that this serves that purpose, it goes beyond what is absolutely necessary to accomplish that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.554" offset="9323666">Now, that standard applies only to the exceptional First Amendment cases and we submit it not to this type of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.621" offset="11399879">And if the Court accepts both those arguments, then the exceptional standard in judging those classifications, constitutionality would apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.560" offset="11567689">There is no direct infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.644" offset="11576048">This Court has dealt with a right to travel, of course, in Edwards versus California and the various passport cases and the Guest case arising in Georgia and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.008" offset="11617426">But in each of those cases, there was a direct infringement upon the right to travel not as here a mere discouragement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.191" offset="11662148">But let's explore for a minute what would be the affect of holding that this was an unconstitutional infringement of the right to travel where you have State A that has a very low grant, where you have State B that has a very generous grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.021" offset="11733514">We have an individual in State B that wants to go to State A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.233" offset="11754308">I am discouraged from traveling to State A says the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.032" offset="11773534">Because if I go there, the grant is only one-quarter, one-fifth of what I am receiving in this state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.945" offset="11809165">Now, would that then mean that the state with a low grant would be constitutionally required to up its grant to that of the most generous state because the amount of difference between the grants and state displayed is tremendous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.521" offset="11883457">And you could make this argument just as effectively between the amounts of assistance granted as a discouragement to travel, perhaps moreso than you could the residence a requirement because the residency requirement is all over in one year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.362" offset="12070912">So insofar as this Act is concerned as distinguished in the state acts, it would not be unconstitutional for the reason that the Court found that California statute in Edwards unconstitutional as improper infringement upon interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.539" offset="12339555">I might say just a word, if I may, about the applicability of Section 402(b) of the Social Security Act to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.840" offset="12380829">Appellees in their supplemental brief on page 42 suggests that the Congress in enacting this provision, which of course, provides for federal grants to state programs but with a condition limiting the residency requirement to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.136" offset="12461913">They say that the Congress did not face the question whether any period of residence should be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.452" offset="12491274">Now, that's just plain not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.788" offset="12500574">When the Congress enacted this, it knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.425" offset="12511128">And in fact, this was urged on it by per -- those who thought residency requirements were unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.914" offset="12537041">You can handle this whole problem by just saying you don't get any federal grant if you have any residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.137" offset="12569955">And had the Congress seem fit to do that that would have effectively abolished residency requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.209" offset="12598272">Because while in theory, a state could still operate its own welfare program without federal grants, it would almost certainly not do so since overall the federal grants make up about 57% of the welfare monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.882" offset="12696910">If I may say just one word as to the Vera Barley case which is the case involving the lady who is in St. Elizabeth's Hospital and who applied for public assistance and even though she had been there for years and years under a regulation of the department, she was found to be ineligible because they would not permit residency in a public institution such as St.Elizabeth's to be counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.391" offset="12827000">Now, the court below in Footnote 19 struck down that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.641" offset="12851973">We do not challenge their ruling on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.279" offset="12866497">So we don't need to reach the case here, I think, as far as Vera Barley is concerned, as whether or not the one-year residency requirement would apply to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.925" offset="12941103">I will say one word about the various amici briefs that had been filed on behalf of the appellees position here and remind the Court what it has so often said before that our concern here is with power and not with wisdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.051" offset="13029606">I think that bear stressing because I think almost the entire argument in the amici briefs on behalf of appellees position and a great deal of the argument of appellees themselves go to the question of wisdom and not power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.059" offset="13153635">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.558" offset="13175683">The facts of all three cases are basically similar.And I see no need to review them at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.716" offset="13200238">And likewise, counsel have, I believe, have set forth the legitimate legislative purposes which the states have in -- in which the Federal Congress has in establishing residency requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.968" offset="13257289">What I do think is extremely important in this case is that the legislatures of some 40 states together with the Congress of the United States has determined that residency requirements are lawful in welfare situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.728" offset="13340359">And I would review what this Court just briefly the types of requirements in the various welfare statutes that Congress has passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.047" offset="13385603">Our own, of course, the one at issue here, 42 U.S.C. 402, is grants to states for aid and services to needy families with children which was first enacted with the residency requirement in 1935 and thereafter amended many times without deleting the residency requirement until 1962 through 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.755" offset="13484450">In addition to that in 42 U.S.C 1202, the Congress has provided for aid to the blind, originally passed in 1935 with amendments through 1964 and a residency requirement again of one year and five of nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.117" offset="13569923">In 1935, the Congress passed aid to permanently and totally disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.286" offset="13594582">It was amended through 1965, the same residency requirements appear, five of nine and one year immediately preceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.918" offset="13629064">In 42 U.S.C. 1382, the Congress enacted aid to aged, blind, disabled, and a medical assistance program for the aged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.529" offset="13671487">Again, a residency requirement was provided five of nine years, one year preceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.138" offset="13697923">In 42 U.S.C. 302, the Congress provided for old age assistance and medical assistance to the aged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.358" offset="13742853">It originally provided for five of nine years and one year preceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.687" offset="13764169">And then in 1960, with reference to medical assistance for the aged, the Congress eliminated the one-year residency require -- requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.856" offset="13804816">And later in 1965 when the Congress passed the medical assistance program, again, the Congress eliminated the residency requirement by providing that the states could not have any residency requirement either for the medical assistance program or for the old age assistance program to the aged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.551" offset="13903663">I believe that that is extremely important in a context of this present case because not only the states, not only the legislatures of the 40 states who have such a program but also the Congress has determined that a residency requirement is a valid requirement in establishing this program and I think there can be no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.678" offset="14016094">But that, if -- if this Court is going to strike down the residency requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment of the states statutes, it also has to face very clearly, very specifically the problem raised since the Congress in enacting Section 402 has also provided, required the legislative -- the -- the administrator to accept the program with a residency requirement therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.365" offset="14150886">Now, if the residency requirement is unlawful, as far as the states are concerned, this Court then also has to say that the Federal Act is unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.000" offset="14209400">Now, with reference to the Fourteenth Amendment problem and whether or not the discrimination in this particular type of requirement is invidious, I believe the case has clearly set forth the area in which the legislatures of the various states can go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.713" offset="14296231">Starting with McGowan versus Maryland, this Court determined that certain Sunday closing laws in the State of Maryland although they were discriminatory, again, certain types of stores were nevertheless lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.548" offset="14359656">Because this Court said that when it comes to a consideration of the equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, the states are allowed a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some group of citizens differently than others and that the constitutional safeguards are offended only if the classification rest on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the state's objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.856" offset="14480865">The state legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that their laws result in some inequality and a statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.564" offset="14559650">Now, McGowan was followed and preceded by a number of cases both in this Court and in some of the Circuit Courts which have also upheld discriminatory estate statutes in various areas where the discrimination was not invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.976" offset="14657348">For example, in Drueding versus Devlin, the Circuit Court held that the Maryland residency requirement with reference to voters of one year in the state and six months in the county was not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.889" offset="14740940">In Allied Stores versus Bowers in 1959, this Court held that an Ohio tax on property and a warehouse, which exempted a non-resident, was not invidious discrimination since the state was presumed to have acted on a rational basis in setting up its tax statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.938" offset="14837175">In Carrington versus Rash, which was again a voting case, this Court in 1965 when considering a Texas statute with reference to residency requirement of military said, “You cannot discriminate -- you cannot discriminate between residents, one who are in the military and one who are not in the military, but you certainly can establish a residency requirement for voting.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.821" offset="14944695">And likewise back in 1948, this Court in 336 U.S. Railway Express versus New York in considering a New York City traffic regulation which actually forbid advertising on trucks other than that of the owner said that such a regulation was such discrimination was not invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.023" offset="15037482">And finally, of course, in Flemming versus Nestor in 363 U.S. 603, this Court actually considered a question involving old age survivorship and disability insurance benefits.And there, the Congress had not just established a residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.058" offset="15121701">There the Congress had actually taken away the benefits from an alien who became eligible in 1955 and was deported in 1956 and as a result of his deportation, benefits were taken away from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3813.312" offset="15358683">In Flemming versus Nestor, this Court determined that there was no discrimination in that particular situation where the Congress had actually taken away this type of assistance from an alien who was deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.859" offset="15436842">And this Court established that there are many different requirements in the Social Security Act that there are no accrued property rights in the system, and that Congress may modify the statutory scheme so long as Congress does not act arbitrarily and so long as a due process is not offended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.759" offset="15528479">I think it is not worthy that to indicate that even in the dissent in Flemming versus Nestor, the dissent of Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Brennan, there is a clear indication in specific language that Congress could limit benefits to residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.872" offset="15612907">Now, if I may -- if I may also consider with the Court briefly, the effect of the congressional of Congress legislating in this particular type of case and establishing a residency requirement the -- and I submit that following this Court's decision in Bolling versus Sharpe which affected the segregation in schools in the District of Columbia and followed Brown versus the Board of Education, that in that case this Court declared unconstitutional, of course, the segregated school case in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.775" offset="15820528">But at the same time, this Court says that the Fifth Amendment does not contain an Equal Protection Clause and that this -- and that the concepts are not necessarily the same, that equal protection is a more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than due process of law, and that therefore, we do not imply that the two are always interchangeable, but as this Court has recognized, discrimination may become so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.927" offset="15993145">Now, as -- as counsel from the District of Columbia has indicated, this Court has clearly seen that there is a double standard when it comes to the type of discrimination which the Congress or the state legislatures may make depending upon the type of right that is involved because Bolling versus Sharpe was clearly a discrimination based on race and this Court will not tolerate discriminations based upon that particular ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.942" offset="16137237">The Court's opinion in Bolling versus Sharpe refers back to such cases as Detroit Bank versus the United States where a federal tax statute was discriminatory and that it applied to one type of property and not to the other but nevertheless was upheld, and likewise, to Currin versus Wallace, 1939 Supreme Court case, where the exercise of the commerce power while it was subject to Fifth Amendment principles, nevertheless, could be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.115" offset="16269834">So that I think when we consider the basis on which this Court must consider the Act of Congress which is here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.201" offset="16326259">And I do respectfully submit that there is an Act of Congress in addition to an act of the state legislature here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.798" offset="16364607">And in considering the Act of Congress, the Court will consider in terms of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.681" offset="16388117">And the Fifth Amendment does not contain an Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.691" offset="16408179">And the Due Process and Equal Protection are not always interchangeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.245" offset="16426360">And even though discriminatory federal action may be so unjustifiable to be violative of Fifth Amendment due process, the test so far as the federal action is concerned, is whether the alleged discriminatory feature is reasonably related to any proper governmental objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.129" offset="16513923">Now here, the proper governmental objective which the Congress determined was to have a program in which the states would participate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4470.396" offset="17987020">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.467" offset="18003320">Although there are other arguments presented in our briefs, I suggest that in the final analysis, the decisions below can most simply and should be affirmed upon the very familiar principle that a legislative classification which discriminates without justification against those who exercise a fundamental constitutional liberty violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.338" offset="18134768">The guarantee of equal protection certainly applies to the granted benefits and privileges as well as to regulation or taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.045" offset="18177609">The one-year residence requirement here and Connecticut's requirement also divides mothers and children who are identically situated in relation to their need, their desires, and in every other conceivably relevant way into two classes, all residents who are granted the benefit and newer residents who are denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.488" offset="18279382">And the discrimination operates in relation to the most fundamental necessities, the very rudiments of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.947" offset="18313237">The classification rest not only on an invidious distinction against newcomers or strangers but it singles out as the sole ground for that hospital treatment the exercise of a long-recognized constitutional liberty to leave one residence and to move to another in the search of better opportunities, better associations, and better environment, a privilege which has been fundamental relics of this country's whole existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.920" offset="18441132">Finally, I shall show that if one examines the alleged justifications for this discrimination which is prima facie invidious for the reason that I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.532" offset="18495572">He finds that none of them will stand careful examination because none of them are reasonably related to any of the permissible or legitimate object of state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.101" offset="18549802">Before elaborating those propositions which are the heart of the cases I proposed to argue with, I think it may be helpful to go back and put the issue in its proper statutory and factual background.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.220" offset="18614272">Historically, as the brief for the center of study of welfare policy and law finds out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.427" offset="18643111">Historically, public assistance laws go back to the Elizabethan Poor Laws if not earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.348" offset="18670801">And as the amicus brief traces it down in this deed as this Court did in Edwards and California and then the Chief Justices raised an opinion in King and Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.314" offset="18710716">There was, at that time in an age when many of the idea still derived from feudalism and then in an age when most people certainly ordinary poor people were not very mobile, a notion that each vicinage should take care of what Mrs. Williams calls “our people” of those who are settled in, and that it had no obligation to those strangers, those outsiders who come from someone else, somewhere else, and whom we don't quite know, and we don't quite trust, and we don't quite like, and we don't have any obligation to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.852" offset="18880825">Now, in the present century when matters as pension laws and other forms and social assistance began to be adapted in this country, the combination of this anachronistic idea plus a continuing hostility to distrust for poor strangers.Plus, I suspect an opposition to making any larger expenditure as then you could possibly withheld, combined to produce in the early statutes extraordinarily strict length of residence or prior residence requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.470" offset="19047278">For mothers aid many states had laws requiring four or five-year residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.748" offset="19072460">For old age, the requirements in various states run up to 15, 20, in the one state even 35 years prior residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.664" offset="19112061">And that was the situation when Congress considered the Social Security Act in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.203" offset="19142259">As it has been pointed out that statute provided for federal contributions to approve state plans in a number of categories of assistance the most important being aid to dependent children and that's clearly the most important for the purposes of this case, aid to the blind, aid to the aged and later aid to the totally and permanently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.443" offset="19243196">Congress was faced by this duration of residence requirements and concluded that they were objectionably long.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.603" offset="19295859">And with respect to each category of assistance, it imposed a limit and the duration of residence that the state might impose or might require.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.102" offset="19341834">Taking as an example, the ADC program, we quote in page 39 of our brief Section 402(b) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.471" offset="19395333">And when I say “our brief” I mean our supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.604" offset="19411843">The administrator shall approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in subsection a, accept that he shall not approve any plan which imposes as a condition of eligibility for aid to dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.323" offset="19466700">A residence requirement which denies aid with respect to any child residing in the state, who has resided there for one year who are -- who was born within the preceding year if the parent had resided there for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.758" offset="19532424">Now, our view is that the role of Section 402 (b) was to outlaw residence requirements of more than one year leaving the situation with respect to residence requirement of a year or less exactly where Congress found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.781" offset="19608492">It said that more than a year is bad and it said nothing about the rest, one way or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.782" offset="19636600">This, I submit, is entirely consistent with the form of the statute and it's entirely consistent with the basic purpose of the statute that was to set minimum requirements and then leave the rest to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.420" offset="19695114">Now, I stress the point because it means, of course, that the courts below were right in very largely ignoring Section 402(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.763" offset="19740463">It drops out of the case for two reasons, first, if Congress didn't express any judgment on residence requirements for less than a year, then certainly there is no question of the judiciary differing to the legislative judgment the congressional judgment that a residence requirement of one year is a good thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.373" offset="19830951">Congress didn't have to address itself to them and therefore it wouldn't have expressed any such judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.446" offset="19855193">Second, there is no need for the Court to worry about invalidating any provision of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.061" offset="19893645">There is nothing that directs the secretary of HEW to approve a plan which includes a discrimination which this Court has held to be unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="5005.460" offset="20127284">But when the Privileges and Immunities Clause or the Commerce Clause, it was simply saying we don't say anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.200" offset="20154243">But of course on the approach that I stated at the outset, and I think each one of the advantages of the approach that I have stated at the outset, one doesn't have to concern himself with that question because one comes back and pitches this case on the Equal Protection Clause and the provisions of the constitution dealing with -- I don't like to call it the right to travel because it's the right to migrate and settle in a new place and to seek new advantages not just to move around are important because they show that this is an affirmative constitutional value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.806" offset="20288616">But we are not concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.994" offset="20293423">Was there more technical scope or with that -- just what body they apply to or just what technically is the source the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.178" offset="20334174">I should remind the court as we might have in our brief that the administrator of Social Security and the Secretary of the Department of Health Education Welfare has often refused to approve state plans violating the Equal Protection Clause in the substantive sense not because he concluded they violated the Equal Protection Clause necessarily or establishing other inequitable classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.644" offset="20456009">But two examples have come quickly to mind are his disapproval of a plan, which would have excluded Indians and children of Indians, and his disapproval of a plan that would have excluded illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.475" offset="20511284">Both of those under the Equitable Classification Law were disapproved by the secretary even though they're not expressly mentioned in Section 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.644" offset="20559976">And surely, that same power applies to giving effect to the decisions of this Court with respect to a constitutional eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.050" offset="20621625">I add, although I hope it's not necessary, that if the Court should disagree with our reading of Section 402(b), then of course we say that Section 402(b) is unconstitutional for the same reason that we say that the state laws and the special statute applicable to the District of Columbia are unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="5222.985" offset="20997371">Other states including New York, Rhode Island, and today Massachusetts, Maine, Hawaii, and a few others, do not have a residence requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="5252.512" offset="21115444">It provides in the middle of the page, “Assistance may be granted only to or on behalf of a person residing in Pennsylvania which resided therein for at least one year preceding the date of application or who has resided in a state with which Pennsylvania has a reciprocal agreement making residence unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.433" offset="21203111">I mentioned they are because I come back to the significance of that alternative later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.925" offset="21225159">I think it has a good deal of bearing on what are the purposes of this legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.096" offset="21253789">The operation of the statute in Pennsylvania, but also it will serve for other cases, is illustrated by its application to the plaintiff Juanita Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.757" offset="21308437">Juanita Smith lived in Pennsylvania with a family, with a mother and father who had lived there all their lives forbearance who had lived there earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.907" offset="21357025">From the time she was one month old until she must been around 16 or 17, until she was old enough to bare children, she then went to Delaware with a man named Peter where they lived for a few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.322" offset="21418674">She came back with five children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.296" offset="21434556">At the invitation of her father who had promised to help -- help Peter to get a job and to help the family out until Peter did get a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.034" offset="21481576">So this was a very, in a real sense, a matter of going back home if I may use home colloquially in the family sense or rather than in any technical sense of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.619" offset="21531941">It was rejoining the family and going to the family to get help.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.538" offset="21555555">Unfortunately, Peter didn't get a job and went back to Delaware then when Juanita Smith's father lost his job, he couldn't take care of her and the five children anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.777" offset="21608532">She was pregnant, sick with a very bad varicose problem, and she went to the welfare people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.788" offset="21640610">The welfare people, because of the residence requirement had no solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.656" offset="21672061">The only thing they could say was, “We'll either go back to Delaware,” because she didn't want to leave her family.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.010" offset="21689511">She didn't want to go back to Delaware for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.175" offset="21710096">Or, we'll take your children away from you and provide institutional care which might run anywhere from six months to two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.562" offset="21755653">And this at least will provide them with shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.782" offset="21768505">But there's nothing else under the residence requirement we -- they could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.217" offset="21794314">Ms. Smith was taken care of by the Travelers Aid Society which agreed to provide a modicum of means until this test litigation could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.536" offset="21847604">The three judge District Court granted first a temporary injunction against the enforcement of the residence requirement which then did provide the necessary aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.387" offset="21894938">That injunction as the Court knows was later made permanent and the cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.937" offset="21921165">The decision below, I may recall, rested primarily on the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.859" offset="21952825">And I would also emphasize that the decision in the Pennsylvania District Court was one of far there are many decisions by three judge District Courts all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.891" offset="22008936">There are at least five major opinions and decisions where the court seems genuinely to have considered the case itself in the last and since the argument in this case in the opinion in the District of Massachusetts, in the Court which circuit Judge Aldridge presided over.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.577" offset="22083751">There are also a raft of temporary orders which I don't think I can really claim as authority because they just followed what had happened before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.570" offset="22119696">But nevertheless, with the exception of one case there's been an extraordinary uniformity of opinions to which I think this Court would wish to give weigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.578" offset="22167761">The District of Columbia statute is a little bit different from that of Pennsylvania and I want to explain some of the idiosyncrasies in its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.317" offset="22226693">The District of Columbia statute appears on page 2 of the fattest of the briefs, the first brief for the appellees in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.813" offset="22288656">Public assistance shall be awarded to or on behalf of any needy individual who either (a) has resided in the district for one year immediately preceding the date of filing his application for such assistance, or (b) who was born with one -- one year immediately preceding the application for such aid, if the parent or other relative with whom the child is living has lived in the district for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.706" offset="22400251">Three of the four plaintiffs in the District of Columbia case fall into the familiar -- if one is familiar with these cases' pattern illustrated by Juanita Smith of whom I spoke earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.866" offset="22464930">That is to say they are mothers of dependent children without present husbands who moved into the new jurisdiction either to go back home for the most part or rejoin their families or to get help from some person or perhaps to get a job and then who are left absolutely destitute of when misfortune occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.720" offset="22588332">Two of the district cases show the -- what I call the idiosyncrasies of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.513" offset="22627516">One is the case of Gloria Jean Brown for the most part her saga is like that of Juanita Smith that is to say she grew up in Washington DC.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.053" offset="22677671">She went out of state with children and then she came back to a large family.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.787" offset="22708600">I mean her father and brothers insisted which was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5655.680" offset="22728140">When she was coming back, she left the two children she had taken with her to Arkansas there for a month or two while she came back and reestablish empennage in which to bring them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.685" offset="22788117">Then when she found she had to apply for assistance and when her oldest child who was here and she both receive assistance under the one-year residence law, these other two in the same family who certainly were in the same situation and who certainly have the same ties to the District of Columbia when she did, were denied the assistance that was given to the oldest child.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.693" offset="22900234">And the -- worse than that, the little baby in the family not being a year-old hadn't resided in the district for a year so it will -- too was held not to have the same connection as its mother and older brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.941" offset="22969198">Really still my idiosyncratic was the case which I understood counsel just to withdraw the case of Vera Barley who came to the District of Columbia and even if they have conceded in this, it shows the operation of these laws who came to the District of Columbia in 1943 and she was coming back to a place where she lived before so not for very long even then.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.717" offset="23088316">She had the misfortune to become incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.024" offset="23109528">She was confined to St. Elizabeth's.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.320" offset="23126664">She was in St. Elizabeth's for 29 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.741" offset="23148398">If public assistance could be provided to her, she was determined by the doctors to be competent to be released and arrangements were made to -- for her living in a nursing home here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.491" offset="23207434">But the district said no, she hadn't one year's residence, so she had to stay in St. Elizabeth's.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.168" offset="23242125">A good deal has been said about saving money in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.786" offset="23256545">It costs roughly three times as much to keep her in St. Elizabeth as it would've kept to provide the aid to the totally and permanently disabled, and let her go to a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.469" offset="23307327">I may say that that is also true of many of these children for whom the only future under the one-year residence rule was going to institutional care, which is more expensive per child on the average than the aid under the ADC programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="6045.870" offset="24288904">The Connecticut statute is the very last page in the brief in the Connecticut case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6051.546" offset="24311578">When any person comes into this state without visible means of support for the immediate future and applies without visible means of support for the immediate future, and applies for aid to dependent children, you'll notice this applies only to AFDC and not to other categories of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.822" offset="24392662">Within one year from his arrival, such person shall be eligible only for temporary aid or care until arrangements are made for his return.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.314" offset="24438638">Under the regulations of the Connecticut Welfare Department, the requirement of visible means of support are means that you must either have a specific job offer or resources, money or property that will last you for three months.</text>

            <text syncTime="6262.920" offset="25157110">And this, I wouldn't want to say it was true of all states, Justice Fortas, but it's a characteristic of many of these programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.078" offset="25197756">In coming back now to my legal propositions, I shall direct myself first to the unqualified one year prior residence requirement and then deal with any peculiarities of the Connecticut case further on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6292.557" offset="25275601">We picture our case ultimately, as I said in the beginning, upon the preposition that the one year's prior residence requirement violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.990" offset="25341430">Because without any justification, say a prejudice against strangers, against new residence who are poor, it discriminates in relation to the fundamental necessities of life between two groups of persons who are otherwise identically situated, let's say that one of them has chosen recently to exercise the fundamental liberty to leave an old environment and move to a new residence in search of preferred associations, opportunities or environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.806" offset="25524600">I -- I would emphasize that that proposition embraces three elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.559" offset="25555634">First, that the one year residence requirement discriminates in relation to the fundamental necessities of life between two classes of persons who are identically situated in terms of need or the appropriateness of the remedy that is offered or any other thing of that kind, say how long they've been there or where they came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="6393.015" offset="25677469">Second, the sole basis of classification is a differentiation between the new and the old residence would be all granted assistance and the new denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.860" offset="25732848">That discrimination against strangers, against new comers, against those who, Mrs. Williams said during her oral argument “are not our people” which I think, with no offense at all to her intent, reveals that this sort of rest on a prejudice against the outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.690" offset="25824172">It's invidious in that sense like racial or religious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.278" offset="25854579">But it also penalizes the exercise of a, what I take to be, a liberty of freedom and aspect of freedom which has long constitutional recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.981" offset="25909332">And then, the third element is that the classification serves as no substantial relation to the accomplishment of any permissible state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.157" offset="25954053">Under the grab bag of justifications that the appellants put forward here in their briefs, most of them, testimony to the ingenuity of counsel, I think it'd be shown really not to stand up on any careful analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.186" offset="26022181">Now, I do want to emphasize this or I think one could argue that we do argue in some of our briefs that perhaps someone or two of those three elements in the case would be enough to make account a case for unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.664" offset="26108071">But I suggest to the Court that we don't need to go that far, that all we need to say is that adding all three together, the one year's prior residence requirement is unconstitutional as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause then we developed each of the three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6523.300" offset="26198664">But preliminarily, I ought to say that of course the constitutional guarantees against hostile or arbitrary and capricious classifications apply to legislation conferring advantages or opportunities or privileges just as much as they do to legislation that regulates our taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.978" offset="26301377">The obvious example would be a state granted aid program that discriminated down grounds of race or that discriminated down grounds of religion as in Sherbert and Verner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6562.583" offset="26355712">There are plenty of cases which if you read them carefully sustained this -- this proposition of the Gerard College case of Evans and Milton, Simkins and Moses Cone, a Fourth Circuit case when which this court denied certiorari, and again the Sherbert and Verner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6583.481" offset="26439304">I think all show that there is nothing new in this suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6589.963" offset="26465322">Now on the first of the three elements, we suggest, as I say, that the one year prior residence rule discriminates in relation to the minimum essentials of life between persons who are identically situated except for their residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.940" offset="26561139">The proposition is perfectly simple and I don't think anyone is going to dispute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6620.545" offset="26587575">But quite frankly, I'm a -- a little worried that because of its simplicity, its importance make it overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.858" offset="26632819">That's one reason I stressed the facts that this is a discrimination in regard between people who are identically situated in relation to the fundamental necessities of life.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="6842.748" offset="27476365">Under the HEW definitions, as soon as he arrives and begins to abide there with no intention to leave, no intention immediately to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="6858.970" offset="27541253">I would say that the distinction is an invalid one subject to the matter of a -- of a period of time to determine whether he is a resident and I would say that the state has no sufficient justification for discriminating against new comer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6877.282" offset="27614501">I will also argue, but I would like to postpone this till tomorrow and I get a little farther on my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.768" offset="27640519">But I will also argue, Mr. Chief Justice, that even if we assumed for the purposes of this case that I am wrong in saying that it has no power to take any steps, I will argue that this statute is overly broad for reasons I will explain later in my argument and that the state could deal with any problem which might, contrary to my argument, be supposed to exist by an hour over a piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.160" offset="27782102">I've -- I've just, if I may to take the one minute left, I was emphasizing that these plaintiffs are identically situated with respect to need and anything that might be thought relevant to determining need or deserts or the suitability of a particular kind of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6947.119" offset="27893906">The other reason I stressed that is because it seems to me that the Court might be legitimately concerned if we were pressing it to pass upon the reasonability of categories of aid as between the deaf and the dumb and the blind or as between the widows of veterans and the widows of civil service employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6974.238" offset="28002367">But this distinction clearly has nothing to do with deciding how to solve one problem or how to solve another problem or with determining what is the nature of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6987.456" offset="28055239">But the nature of the problem is identical in the case of the new residents and the older residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6994.457" offset="28083242">And then I do go on, Justice Fortas, in the morning from there.</text>
