            <text syncTime="52.700" offset="314180">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.152" offset="327973">This is a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the affirmance by that court of an order of the Federal Maritime dismi -- Commission which dismissed the complaint of the present petitioner, Volkswagenwerk which had been bought Volkswagen in its capacity as a large shipper for the mobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.436" offset="437164">The case raises issues in the three provisions of the Shipping Act of 1916 as amended Sections 15, 16 and 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.469" offset="485230">The United States as a statutory party to this review proceeding has filed a brief in support of the position of the petitioner and I have agreed with counsel for the Solicitor General here on a division of the argument in such a way that it will be my task to briefly outline the facts and to present the issues arising in the Sections 16 and 17 of the Shipping Act by counsel for the Solicitor will then argue the case with respect to Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.137" offset="639875">My statement as to the facts will rely throughout on findings of the Commission except that in two occasions which I will identify them, I come to them and rely on undisputed evidence on which no finding was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.429" offset="717093">Pacific Maritime Association, the intervener in the proceedings below and here is an association of shipping lines, common carriers by water, stevedores and terminal operators, operating at the United States Pacific Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.001" offset="799326">The purpose of the Association is to negotiate and administer collective bargaining agreements with the various unions involved in the shipping industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.104" offset="847809">In 1960 and 1961, a number of agreements were entered into -- between Pacific Maritime Associations, the intervener and International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, the bargaining representatives of all the onshore laborers, the stevedoring and terminal labor on the Pacific Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.568" offset="949687">The agreements so far as here relevant provided in substance that the union would waive its prior objections to restrict the -- both practices and federal bidding and that the union would consent to the application by the employers of automation and labor-saving devices in return for the creation of the so-called mechanization and modernization fund, both of which certain benefits there to be paid to members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.742" offset="1082389">The mechanization fund under the agreement was to reach over a period of five and a half year an amount of altogether $29 million, $5 million a year was to be raised for the period from -- the beginning of 1961 to the middle of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.506" offset="1177370">After these agreements were entered into the employer association, PMA, considered the method by which the contribution to the fund is $5 million contribution should be raised and as a result of PMA's internal procedures, the recommendation by special committee appointed to this purpose, recommendation by the Board, both of the membership and the final decision of the Board of PMA as a result of all of this, a method was devised which in effect provided that every stevedoring or terminal operator member of PMA should pay a certain amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.138" offset="1351973">At the beginning that was $27 and a half cent to PMA for each ton of cargo discharged or loaded at the Pacific Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.597" offset="1401710">It is this tonnage tax imposed by PMA which is under attack in this proceeding so far as it applies to automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.145" offset="1447999">Before considering the impact of the tonnage tax on automobiles, it is necessary for me to briefly present the competitive relationship between the parties here.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.634" offset="1501915">Pacific Maritime Association is dominated by shipping lines and common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.639" offset="1529919">There is testimony in the record by the vice president and treasurer of PMA to the effect that as long he was with the Association for some 19 years, the liners had the majority on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.920" offset="1583104">There's an admission in one of the earlier briefs by counsel for PMA that members of PMA are not philanthropist and that they vote in membership meetings in their own self-interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.258" offset="1636394">Without going any deeper in the evidence, I think it is clear that if the liners had the majority of the Board and if that is the result of vote in the self-interest of the members, that the liners have a dominating position in PMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.454" offset="1693236">There are substantially more evidence on this which I like to skip in order to focus more quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.914" offset="1719045">In any event, we have made throughout the contention that the liners control PMA and this contention is been completely ignored both by the trial examiner and by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.807" offset="1774634">It finally was vindicated in a Footnote in the opinion of the Court of Appeals where the Court summarizes the evidence which I just outlined and some more, and then very dryly edit.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.955" offset="1827192">The trial examiner made a statement to the effect that there was no substantial evidence to show liner domination of PMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.505" offset="1857390">I submit that undisputed evidence although no finding established this right of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.978" offset="1883303">The disregard of this fact by the examiner and by the Commission that was in the -- first of four serious defects which in my opinion affects the administrative determination here and I will point out here the defect as I come to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.247" offset="1956342">While PMA is liner dominated, Volkswagen for its very large shipments to the Pacific Coast uses primarily chartered vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.963" offset="1999182">Obviously, the chartering by a shipper or vessels is a form of transportation which is entirely competitive with the business of common carriers and liners.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.236" offset="2044322">Volkswagen -- and this was found is the largest shipper of dry cargo to the Pacific Coast on chartered vessels and obviously, Volkswagen is a party which the liner interest in control of PMS do not precisely like because all business which goes to Volkswagen is business which the liners are using.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.124" offset="2347865">The second defect which I suggest to -- occurred in the administrative proceedings is that the most fundamental allegation which we made in the case, the heart of our case was completely ignored both by the examiner and by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.995" offset="2423306">According to the complaint and according to our evidence and our briefs, reports this proceeding because a tonnage tax imposes a 10 times higher burden on automobiles than on other cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.797" offset="2478582">That was the heart of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.360" offset="2484851">The reason why we went to the Commission and by the evidence again, and this is entirely undisputed and well indeed our allegation somewhat, I believe, I think recognition in the Court of Appeals, the Commission and the examiner studiously avoid it to refer to this cause-effect of the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.569" offset="2573667">Without detailing the evidence to any great extent, I just -- will point out what it shows in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.169" offset="2608044">The people of -- the members of Pacific Maritime Association for stevedoring and terminal labor fr the year 1962, amounted to about $102 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.753" offset="2654333">$5 million was raised by the tonnage tax, it follows that for the average commodity, the tonnage tax represented the cost of a fringe benefit of 5% of the total labor cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.921" offset="2715042">The record shows that as to Volkswagen, the tonnage tax represents 56% of total labor so that I'm still modest if I claim that this is only a 10 times heavier burden on -- as in on average general cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.915" offset="2787035">There's one last fact which I have to present and which is vital in connection with this one, namely that automobiles did not derive any benefit more than average cargo from the arrangement which led to the tonnage tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.291" offset="2852551">On this, one day, a clear findings throughout, the examiner, the Commission and the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.701" offset="2874180">They had the average benefit of this -- they replaced was the arrangement with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.405" offset="2896959">There'll be a less work stoppages and slow downs, there were no strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.205" offset="2912214">We were working in a much improved atmosphere as everybody else but there was -- is not even a contention of any additional or special benefit which automobiles derived it from the arrangement even though automobiles were subjected to a 10 times larger tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.568" offset="2985671">That brings me to the legal discussion so far as I have undertaken to present it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.720" offset="3014301">Section 17 of the Shipping Act provides an essence that carriers and other regulated person, including stevedores and terminal operators, may not engage in unreasonable practices and that it's a duty of the Commission if it finds unreasonable practices to go back to them and to prescribe reasonable practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.023" offset="3119417">My submission is that a charge 10 times heavier with the same benefit which was extended to all as a cargo is on its face an unreasonable practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.894" offset="3178977">The Commissioner -- I'm sorry, the Commission and the examiner never passed on this issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.000" offset="3215339">They refused to face the issue on -- under the pretext that the petitioner in the proceeding had challenged only the practices of the technical respondent here, a stevedore who is serving Volkswagen and have not challenged the practice of Pacific Maritime Association and its members in devising and levying this tonnage tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.840" offset="3310738">This statement that our attack had been directed only against the stevedore who tried to pass the tonnage tax onto us has no foundation whatsoever in the reading of the complaints of our proposed findings of our exceptions, of our briefs which shows this and indeed the Court of Appeals stated again in a Footnote but very strongly that it rejected at the outset the contention that our attack in this case was directed only at the practices of the respondent stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.820" offset="3430693">And then the Court of Appeals proceeded to examine our contention under Section 17 on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.871" offset="3470817">In doing so --</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.970" offset="4155225">But if he had not made a case under 15, then the Court is confronted without charge to say that any event is unreasonable and a discriminatory arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.608" offset="4281762">The Court of Appeals agreeing on this was asked then went on and decided the Section 17 issue on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.457" offset="4313213">And in doing so, I submit that the Court of Appeals fell into the error which had been pointed out in this Court by a decision such as Securities and Exchange Commission versus Chenery Corporation or more recently, Burlington Truck Lands versus United States, namely that a reviewing -- a Court reviewing an administrative action should not substitute its own reasons for those of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.633" offset="4421883">The Commission which Congress had appointed to pass in the first instant with its expert knowledge on discretion have not made any determination as to whether or not the PMA arrangement as such violated 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.852" offset="4478830">The Court of Appeals therefore I believe should not have reached this issue -- or but should've remand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.228" offset="4504325">Neither as it may, the reason which the Court gave in order to sustain the PMA tonnage tax under Section 17, in my opinion is not convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.387" offset="4548942">The thrust of the opinion of the Court of Appeals is to the effect that this tonnage tax was a rough-and-ready measure to resolve a problem and that a rough-and-ready formula for the distribution of charges is permissible even though it results for some in a wholly disproportionate burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.952" offset="4651133">One reason which the Court invoked to support this was that a rough-and-ready tax formula might be desirable and (Inaudible) of administrative experience and of expense and collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.684" offset="4702124">This reason, isn't it born out to the best that they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.645" offset="4713932">PMA already levies a tax which requires all stevedores and terminal operators to file tonnage reports but the tax itself is graduated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.943" offset="4759176">So, there is one charge, $27 and a half cents in 1961 for general cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.685" offset="4786134">There's another charge, $5 and a half cent for bulk cargo and for scrap metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.754" offset="4810376">And there is still rate for coast rice cargo and coast rice transportation and the lowest of all is for lumber and lowest in the coast rice trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.256" offset="4848410">Now, whether the stevedores who in all of these trades reports a tonnage then figure out the tax at the rate of $27 and a half which is assessed against Volkswagen or at another rate obviously is not a problem which can create administrative difficulty or additional expense in collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.338" offset="4920717">So that it seems the second argument of the Court of Appeals is not attainable in any event, is not sustained by the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.196" offset="6104168">The record is (Inaudible) as it's showing that automobiles have a very low labor content and for the same reason as bulk cargo, once a classification is made, its unreason -- not to extend it to automobiles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.920" offset="7351045">Indeed, if the Court found in Section 16 and 17 had been violated, it would then be clear that the Commission could not approve the agreement under Section 15 because may not approve an agreement that violates the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.946" offset="7679143">Now, I shall address myself briefly to this issue whether the agreement must be filed under Section 15 and two issues are involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.871" offset="7714879">The first and quite the simpler, is whether looking solely to the policies of the Shipping Act, an agreement of this sort ought to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.859" offset="7754794">And the second and more difficult is whether bringing into the picture the policies of -- policies relating to labor relations and collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.013" offset="7803382">Some special exemption should be recognized here because of the labor relations implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.356" offset="7840789">Now, the Section 15 requires the filing of every agreement which among other things regulates competition or gives special advantages or provides for a preferential arrangement or in any manner provides very cooperative working arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.922" offset="7919052">And I think it is common ground among the parties here that the purpose of this was to subject to administrative scrutiny and force into the open all concerted action in the shipping industry which might invade the interest protected by the Shipping Act foremost among them the protection of shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.624" offset="8017899">And when as here, the terminal companies and shipping lines dominating the entire West Coast get together and agree upon a quite substantial tax on tonnage handle in order to establish this $30 million mechanization fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.714" offset="8106193">This is plainly an agreement that can have a very large impact on shippers and therefore the Commission should look at it in advance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2163.471" offset="8757269">But here, we need to go so far to say that the Maritime firms had to get the Commission's permission to bargain as a unit because here, it's not the multi-employer bargaining that is an issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.369" offset="8816828">It is simply a quite separate agreement among the members of the association as to how to raise a particular fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2218.188" offset="8976175">Whether this is true or not, we don't know at this stage but it suggests that they are the kind of dangers here which are traditionally associated with collective boycotts and that's precisely the kind of evil that led to the Shipping Act into the filing requirement of Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.100" offset="9071783">Now, there's -- some concern has been expressed that if this agreement must be filed because of its impact on shippers, every cooperative agreement among shipping firms must be filed and that of course is the literal force of the Act and that I don't think there would necessarily be anything shocking or unmanageable about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.435" offset="11413086">At this juncture, it appears abundantly clear that there is some confusion as to the impact concerning filing or non-filing under Section 15 of the Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.322" offset="11460629">I think it's interesting to note that Mr. Herzfeld urges that the Commission needs some guidelines from this Court and urges that the Commission denied them their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.478" offset="11505246">Yet he is urging that the Commission be given even broader and more extensive powers than the Commission itself has ever sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="4346.048" offset="17487600">The reason for that is that one of the benefits that is known as the vesting benefit is essentially -- it's been determined by the Internal Revenue Service at any rate to be an early retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.568" offset="17549667">And the manner in which the plan was set up, it was impossible to fund that benefit with prior funding as the industry wish to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.895" offset="17590941">They wish to set up this early retirement benefit and fund it within the five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.854" offset="17622810">This could not be done and established the right to deduct the sums of money that were being put into the vesting benefit trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.633" offset="17665860">We have been compelled in order to get the tax result upon which the plan was dependent to establish what is known as a current payment pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.402" offset="17716955">We only therefore -- therefore, we only collect the amount of money that is necessary to pay current vesting benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.009" offset="17751437">We have several thousand men who have retired and more are continually retiring where they are looking forward to getting those who retired under the initial plan, $220 a month and until they've received approximately $8000, they have claims against the trust and we collect currently to pay this benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.581" offset="17849657">Now this means, since some men will retire in the last months of the plan, it means, we have to have provisions where we will be collecting three years later because it's paid out over a three-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.481" offset="17901275">And our maximum annual amount is reduced in order to make the provision for this later collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.558" offset="17933563">So, the rates in the first three years were $5 million but they've gone down which of course means that the rate on the tonnage assessment goes down for everybody who is subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.916" offset="17991032">Also, as the cargo increases in volume, the rate goes down.</text>

            <text syncTime="5087.698" offset="20454170">Coastwise lumber is a general cargo and I'd like to explain that because it is extremely important that it be understood that this Court could make a serious error on -- if it is not understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.400" offset="20512998">Most of the carriers and handlers, the Coastwise Lumber are all companies that are not members of the Pacific Maritime Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.661" offset="20549987">They conduct their own private negotiations with the ILWU as do some other organizations but it's very important on the Coastwise Lumber to recognize that they're all, except one and it's not the important one are outside of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.224" offset="20632221">The plan, not -- like all the rest of the plans we have is set up to allow those members of the industry who are not a member of our association if they want to participate through their negotiations with the ILWU who will be able to participate the pension plan, the welfare plans, the vacation plans, the Mech plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.973" offset="20731277">If they couldn't, we would be running the risk of running them out of business by cutting them out of a facility that employees would want the benefits of it, it wouldn't work for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.138" offset="20775894">ILWU negotiated a lower rate than our rate with the Coastwise Lumber people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.050" offset="20807555">And we were confronted with saying to nonmembers, pay our rate or don't participate in the plan or reducing the rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5188.238" offset="20856351">In other words, we did just the opposite of what this Court condemned in the Pennington and Jewel Tea cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.698" offset="20890206">I think we had an obligation to reduce the rate but I certainly don't want to be condemned for keeping the plan open to nonmembers to participate on rates to get Longshore employees that they negotiated with the ILWU.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.073" offset="20959692">I see that my time is closing, I'm -- one point I wish to make, Justice Fortas asked this very early in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.827" offset="20998666">This case presents as we have said in our briefs and there is just no question of it in our mind whether there's any residual jurisdiction in the Maritime Commission to supervise labor management relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.806" offset="21066585">The findings of six -- page 637 of this record, make absolutely clear that he only thing PMA members were doing were implementing a collective commitment that it guaranteed benefits to employees and they were collecting the money to pay those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.139" offset="21147878">Now, I think it's a very usual thing in America, in industry wide bargaining today to set up industry plans where you guarantee benefits to the union in your negotiation and you fund them as -- seems a reasonable fashion among the employer group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.879" offset="21230843">If we can't do that, we're being treated differently than the rest of the industry in America and we've got to know why because we have to accommodate our entire collective bargaining process to those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.636" offset="21285909">We can't work this out on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.105" offset="21299806">We -- our bargaining relationships are pretty volatile and dynamic and we have to know when we go into our negotiations with the maritime unions, the areas where we can say yes or no or we have to say maybe depending upon what the Maritime Commission is going to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.193" offset="21372113">If we don't know that, we're going to be charged with bargaining in bad faith by these unions and will be hold up before the NLRB ultimately to have to defend ourselves.</text>
