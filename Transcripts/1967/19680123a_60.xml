            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 60, Sunray DX Oil Company et al. and companion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.254" offset="160371">Mr. Simon, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

          <turn speaker="morton_l_simon" startTime="20.869" stopTime="410.333">
            <label>Mr. Morton L. Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="20.869" offset="186807">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.894" offset="202898">I appear in these cases on behalf of four clients, the Public Service Commission of the State of New York which is a regulatory agency of that state, and three public utilities serving in the Philadelphia, New York area; Philadelphia Electric Company, Brooklyn Union Gas Company, Long Island Lighting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.314" offset="280639">We appear in these cases are representatives of the consumer interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.923" offset="299029">In these proceedings before the Commission, the contest was between the producers who are regulated by the Commission and who were the applicants for certificates of public convenience and necessity on the one hand and ourselves with some general support from the staff of the Federal Power Commission on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.899" offset="374993">There are three principal issues in this case; their short form is need, in-line and refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.310" offset="412609">On the need issue, the question is whether the Federal Power Commission can grant certificates of public convenience and necessity to the producer applicants authorizing them to make their sales in interstate commerce without first making a finding that there is a public need for the gas proposed to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.724" offset="490245">On that issue it was our position that the Commission was required to make a finding of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.439" offset="513128">The Commission held that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.670" offset="526085">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit in the decision by a Chief Judge Bazelon agreed with us and this Court has granted certiorari on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.638" offset="581883">On the second question, the so called in-line issue, the question is at what initial price should the Commission certificate these sales to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.931" offset="631097">In each of the three dockets, the Commission elevated the in-line price that it had previously found for each of the three areas by one cent per Mcf to correspond with a guideline level that it had previously announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.027" offset="691493">We challenged that once in escalation.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.433" offset="709151">The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has affirmed the Commission's escalation in the District 4 case Amerada.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.290" offset="744573">The District of Columbia Circuit has reversed the Commission's escalation in the Districts 2 and 3 case, Hawkins and Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.976" offset="779264">The Commission, I should add, decide at that one against us also as it had decided the need issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.576" offset="805700">The final issue in the case is if the sales are certificated, should the producers make refunds of the amounts that they have collected under temporary certificates during the pendency of the litigation to the extent that those collections exceed the in-line price as finally determined by the Commission after hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.553" offset="889605">As indicated by other counsel earlier, the Commission originally held in a prior opinion, the Skelly Oil opinion in August of 1962, that it would not require refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.559" offset="941641">We, along with Mr. Coleman's client, United Gas Improvement Company appealed that decision to the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.141" offset="967973">The D.C. Circuit in January '64 held that the Commission could not excuse refunds merely because there had been no expressed refund condition in the temporary, that this Court denied certiorari after the D.C. Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.237" offset="1032338">And up to that time, the Commission had decided against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.874" offset="1042892">After that decision, the Commission substantially decided in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.084" offset="1059715">Accordingly, on these three issues we are opposed to the Commission on need and in-line and we in the Commission are now in agreement on the third question, refund, although there is a slight difference which I will get to when I discuss that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.675" offset="1126066">Now, it appears to us that one of the reasons that the Commission went wrong here is because it overlooked the very basic elements that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.824" offset="1186670">And I want just for a moment to go back to the basics that are involved in the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.658" offset="1209971">These are very elementary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.236" offset="1216345">I apologize to the Court for being so basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.350" offset="1228779">But I think that even as expert a body is the Commission may have jumped in a little too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.823" offset="1250617">May not have gone back into what the Gas Act is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.091" offset="1267754">This Court has reminded that time and time again, that the Natural Gas Act is designed to protect the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.527" offset="1293458">It is a piece of consumer protective legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.869" offset="1306833">That is its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.388" offset="1312893">That is its design.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.893" offset="1318954">That has been the consistent interpretation given to it by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.263" offset="1340374">This Court has phrased that protection in various ways, at various times but it has always been extremely consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.906" offset="1367019">It was to protect the consumer from exploitation of the hands of Natural Gas companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.306" offset="1384573">It was the phrase that Mr. Justice Douglas used in the Hope case back in the 40s.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.239" offset="1408293">That phrase was repeated in a whole series of cases in the late 50s and the early 60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.300" offset="1432534">Mr. Justice Clark in the CATCO case which is really the lead case so far as this whole area of producer certification under Section 7 is concerned, said that the purpose of the Act was to provide a complete, permanent, and effective bond of protection to the consumer from excessive rates and charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.132" offset="1515917">This then is the purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.479" offset="1529292">And I think that it is interesting both in the Commission's opinion to some extent in its brief and on argument yesterday that Commission counsel has noted that the Commission has taken a middle ground between the consumer contentions and the producer contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.150" offset="1604002">Now, that maybe a perfectly accurate description of what the Commission did, and I will come to that later too.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.609" offset="1629811">But I don't think that is -- it is any sort of a defense for the Commission to make of its actions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.218" offset="1652276">It is not charged by statute with adopting a middle ground between contending conditions -- positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.978" offset="1679235">It is charged with protecting the consumer and that is an affirmative duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.842" offset="1698774">And when it has failed to discharge that duty, this Court and the Courts of Appeals have found it necessary to remind the Commission of its duty and to reverse the Commission's action.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="410.333" offset="1744750">There's no other duty at all although except every single contentions made by every representative of every consumer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="morton_l_simon" startTime="415.304" stopTime="541.746">
            <label>Mr. Morton L. Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="415.304" offset="1764603">Certainly not, certainly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.797" offset="1770559">And I -- let me make perfectly clear, Mr. Justice Stewart that by saying that we are consumer representatives does not relieve us one iota of the burden of making persuasive arguments in the statutory terms to you and to persuade you.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.091" offset="1835760">And I meant to obtain no advantage in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.616" offset="1849866">I merely wanted to indicate what our interest was.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.469" offset="1861256">The Commission is certainly not bound to accept a contention because we make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.770" offset="1878497">On the other hand, I don't think that it's discharging its duty to say that it hit somewhere in between the two contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.847" offset="1910784">Its obligation is to do what the statute commands it to do, not to mediate to opposing contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.910" offset="1938996">It's not a mediation board.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.499" offset="1945370">It has affirmative duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.721" offset="1954252">Now, the section of the statute we're dealing with is Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.854" offset="1970761">That came into the Act in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.919" offset="1979016">The original act was passed in '38.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.756" offset="1986435">The original act had -- the heart of the original Act if you will was Sections 4 and 5 which gave the Commission control over rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.455" offset="2029171">Section 7 came in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.293" offset="2040560">That was the certificate section.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.796" offset="2046516">And it says in essence, that no person may sell natural gas for resale in interstate commerce without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.301" offset="2096567">When an applicant seeks a certificate, the Commission is charged by statute with giving notice and providing for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.984" offset="2131257">The hearing is statutorily required; the Commission has no power or authority to waive a hearing on a certificate application.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.912" offset="2163022">If at the hearing, it is found among other things, that the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.155" offset="2200012">And I think that required in the context of the need issue certainly is the keyword here.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.290" offset="2224567">If the sale proposed to be made is required by the public convenience and necessity, then a certificate shall issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.529" offset="2261452">Otherwise, it shall be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.632" offset="2301889">Indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.116" offset="2307845">There are two other aspects of the statute which should be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.079" offset="2327698">One is the Commission has a conditioning power to cure a proposal that is largely correct but partially incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.349" offset="2364792">The Commission does not have to deny it in total.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.105" offset="2375764">It can condition its approval on deletion of the unsatisfactory aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.366" offset="2392795">And it was its conditioning power that led to the in-line conditioning concept in this Court's 1959 CATCO decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.058" offset="2427591">There is another provision of the Act that provides in cases of emergency, the Commission may during the pendency of a decision on the application for a certificate, grant a temporary certificate without notice and without hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.281" offset="2484537">This is an emergency power.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton L. Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="613.223" offset="2556217">I think that is its contention, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.063" offset="2571577">Our problem essentially is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.781" offset="2594461">In reading yesterday to you from the decision of the court below and this is in Volume 4 of the appendix -- at appendix page 266, Mr. Schiff read, a large part starting over at 265 and ending on to 266.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.864" offset="2682859">This is Judge Bazelon's decision in the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.509" offset="2697383">He stopped, however, prior to what I think must be agreed as the operative part really of the D.C. Circuit's decision after discussing what the Court was not deciding Judge Bazelon states, “We decide only that when a party makes a non-frivolous claim that there is a -- there is no public need for the gas, the FPC must give considered reasons if it decides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.357" offset="2816815">Its decision must be made before” and that word is emphasized in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.449" offset="2841161">“Its decision must be made before it grants a permanent certificate to the producer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="689.115" offset="2859865">Now, we think that at the time it issues a certificate, it has to make a finding of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.450" offset="2881181">If it has made a finding of need that is appropriate and applicable in some other proceeding, certainly it can refer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.164" offset="2908035">We have no objection to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.988" offset="2915349">Our problem is that it did not purport to refer to any other finding of need that it had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.089" offset="2939695">That the orders that it was issue in contemporaneous cases indicated that the pipeline purchasers here involved were in a severe take-or-pay situation in which they had contracted to pay for more gas than they could physically take into their system.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.408" offset="3001031">And I think it is agreed that that situation imposes additional cost on the pipeline which will eventually be born by the consumer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.817" offset="4154598">There had been a contention that for the relatively minor facilities, a pipeline might need to attach to supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.211" offset="4184168">And in some cases, apparently 25% of the cases, it might mean no facilities at all to attach supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.602" offset="4205798">The sale might be made out in an existing point on the pipeline's facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.851" offset="4234742">The pipeline each year will say we would like general blanket authority to construct such facilities as we need to attach such gas as we may buy from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.144" offset="4291897">The gas is not identified, the facilities are not identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.989" offset="4303287">The Commission said in adopting this regulation, that it had been proposed to exempt these facilities altogether since they were not sales facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.614" offset="4341844">And the Act speaks in terms of sales, regulating sales, and the facility is used to make sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.790" offset="4362533">They said, “We won't exempt them altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.475" offset="4709230">They say some of them perhaps were before these hearings came on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.853" offset="4738800">They were by and large, this budget applications which there's a one or two-page notice that identifies nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.281" offset="4764505">Now, there was one proceeding in the Sinclair case about almost half of the gas in the Sinclair case was proposed to be sold to Lone Star Gathering Company for in district two, Lone Star was a short line that would gather the gas, do what processing was necessary, resell it to United Gas Pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.809" offset="4850604">The sales to Lone Star were included in the Sinclair proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.445" offset="4873174">The applications of Lone Star and United had been filed sometime before we had intervened in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.723" offset="4902222">The Commission never set it for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.921" offset="4911104">It issued temporary certificates to the pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.763" offset="4922389">It issued first temporaries then permanent certificates in Sinclair to the producers to make the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.863" offset="4946840">After it had issued the certificates to Sinclair, it set Lone Star and United applications for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.360" offset="4976828">We participated in that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.562" offset="4989576">And what happened was very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.023" offset="5003473">After it went through the hearing the first time, the Commission found -- the majority of the Commission found that United had a need for the gas and it should be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.438" offset="5041089">And what they had done in Sinclair was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.315" offset="5052583">And the concurring opinion on that case pointed out that all the Commission really was doing, was ratifying its prior Sinclair opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.077" offset="5083721">It pointed out that as a human psychological matter if you will, unless need as examined when the producers have their applications pending, it will never be examined at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.629" offset="5133876">In any event, the Commission finally need issued a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.273" offset="5148505">We then applied for rehearing, pointing out the numerous legal and factual areas that the Commission had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.405" offset="5181001">The Commission on rehearing concluded that United, the ultimate purchaser from Lone Star Gathering, had not adequately shown need, that there were a number of defects in its presentation, and set the matter rather than denied a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.848" offset="5238784">However, it set the matter down so that Lone Star and United could try a second time to prove need.Lone Star and United first ask for postponement, another postponement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.859" offset="5282774">Then they said, “We give up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.974" offset="5291238">We really don't need the gas if that's what we have to prove.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.090" offset="5307747">Their certificates were cancelled or the permanent certificates were simply revoked, that had never become -- the permanent certificates had never become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.596" offset="5345782">And that gas is no longer being sold in interstate commerce, almost half of the gas in the Sinclair proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.063" offset="10639653">There are a series of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.422" offset="10649057">In September 1960, the Commission established guidelines in each of the three areas at 18 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.570" offset="10673612">There is not the slightest question in the world that that did not conform to this Court's CATCO requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.434" offset="10705063">18 cents was out of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.842" offset="10710706">The Commission subsequently found for each of the three areas that on September 28, 1960 when it promulgated its guidelines, the in-line prices in the three areas were 15 cents in Districts 4 and 2, and 16 cents in District 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.251" offset="10772355">Indeed, those in-line determinations subsequently in 1962 and 1963 had found 15 cents was in-line in District 4 and 2, and 16 cents was in-line in District 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.639" offset="10825958">It amended its guideline levels at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.700" offset="10846124">Instead of amending its guideline levels to the in-line level that had just found as two of the five Commissioners urged, it fixed the guideline level one cent above the in-line level that had just found 16 cents in Districts 4 and 2, 17 cents in District 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.038" offset="10911535">It then sets the instant cases that we have here for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.154" offset="10932015">After hearing, the Commission found that wonderful to relate the in-line level for the period after the policy statement was the elevated by one cent guideline levels that it had fixed at the outset of these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.131" offset="11003904">Now, a difference of one cent per Mcf, while it sounds small, when we apply it to the industry as a whole amounts to enormous sums of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.180" offset="11048103">It is true that in this case they are not that large but then the Chairman of the Commission has pointed out that if you applied one cent across the board to all natural gas sales, you're talking about a $150 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.638" offset="11097945">If you apply it to all of the estimated known reserves in the ground, you're talking about $2.5 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.810" offset="11126575">Now, the purpose of finding an in-line level, we submit, was to protect the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.539" offset="11149563">The way this works is, once the in-line level is found that is the initial price the producer can charge, he can file up under Section 4 for an increase, but if he can't justify the increase, he has to make refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.194" offset="11208182">The evil of a high in-line prices that there is no way to catch by refunds or otherwise, the excess in the event that it should be determined that that in-line price is higher than the subsequent just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.372" offset="11264815">We think that the whole concept of in-line pricing as you start with CATCO is to find the line and then hold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.366" offset="11300864">Now, the Commission talks about, it has to go to current conditions and contemporaneous conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.244" offset="11328345">First of all, there's nothing in the cases that suggests that you have to go to contracts which is what the Commission did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.526" offset="11361468">The Commission limited its view here to contracts entered into in Amerada for example between 1960 and 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.138" offset="11395950">But during this times span, there were enormous volumes of gas being sold under contracts dated prior thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.532" offset="11425520">The Commission ignored all of those prices, fixed itself only on the contracts entered into between 1960 and '62.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.262" offset="11456449">Those contracts had been entered into at high prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.056" offset="11467630">We had intervened on the applications to make those sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.440" offset="11481109">The Commission says because we intervened, there are no permanently certificated prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.656" offset="11502007">We will therefore look at the prices we have temporarily certificated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.078" offset="11515695">In fact, we looked at the very prices that are before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.304" offset="11528547">The Commission in writing at its 16-cent guideline, it relied on 38 contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.595" offset="11557804">36 of those contracts were the contracts at issue in the Amerada preceding where we were holding a hearing to determine what the in-line level should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.458" offset="11593226">The Commission said, well we will grant certification on the basis of the temporary certificates we've issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.454" offset="11621230">As noted, these temporary certificates are issued on an ex parte basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.723" offset="11638262">They are not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.791" offset="11650487">When this whole business started out at the time of Skelly, and the Commission first said that it would not make refunds, we appealed the Skelly decision to the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.884" offset="11690924">At the same time, we appealed some temporary certificates which had just been issued which were issued in our view at out of line prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.386" offset="11720913">The two appeals as McDermott and Skelly were heard before the same panel of the D.C. Circuit, at the same time within a couple of weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.777" offset="11750484">They were decided within a couple of weeks of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.248" offset="11760410">Both opinions were written by Judge Fahy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.769" offset="11770441">And in essence, what he said was, we cannot make a determination on a temporary certificate whether it's right or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.759" offset="11802415">These matters are not foreclosed at the end of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.190" offset="11812133">However, in Skelly he said, at the end of the proceeding, the Commission has to go back and do what is right, make it right from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.603" offset="11845778">We think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.696" offset="11854137">If the Commission doesn't have the power to make it right at the end of the proceeding, then we think that the temporary certificate is wrong, right from its inception because it would then be violating CATCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.072" offset="11891649">And of course this goes to a question that you asked Mr. Justice White yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.785" offset="11910562">It was answered by Mr. Coleman and I want to support his answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.482" offset="11925295">Could the Commission say in a temporary certificate, “We're giving you a temporary certificate at 18 cents or 20 cents or any price and we're not going to make you give anything back at the end of the hearing no matter what”?</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.195" offset="11972106">Could it do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.137" offset="11975868">No.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.792" offset="12242526">We said this is without prejudice to the appeals we're taking in McDermott that you have no right at the outset to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.114" offset="12287875">And the Commission said,</text>

            <text syncTime="3080.546" offset="12425592">He said that one of the purposes of in-line pricing was to prevent rate increase filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.095" offset="12447744">Now, that is just dead wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.532" offset="12457462">You can't find it anywhere in the opinions, and in fact it's illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.904" offset="12475016">If an applicant comes in for an 18-cent price, if you'll allow him his 18-cent price, and that's all he has the contract for, obviously, he can't file up under this Court's mobile doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.389" offset="12520887">If you cut him back and that's what CATCO was talking about, cutting back to the in-line level, certainly, he then has a contract right to file up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.095" offset="12555786">But it seems a very strange thing to say that you're preventing a rate increase filing by giving the producer everything that he would get out of a rating for his filing right at the outset.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.352" offset="12688802">I'm counsel for Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.605" offset="12697788">I am appearing this morning on behalf of the 12 producer respondents who have filed a joint brief in Number 60, 61, 62, Number 80 and 97.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.281" offset="12748466">We are respondents from the appeal taken from the Tenth Circuit's decision at a case which is sometimes referred to as the Amerada case, sometimes the Sunray case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.354" offset="12936756">Mr. Johnson following me will appear on behalf of certain producers who are parties in the appeals from the District of Columbia Circuit's decisions in Sinclair and Hawkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.662" offset="12985971">He will be followed by Mr. Killbourne who is presenting an individual argument on behalf of the Superior Oil Company with respect to the appeal from the District of Columbia Circuit decision in Sinclair and Hawkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.971" offset="13039261">Following Mr. Killbourne will be Mr. Caskin, who is appearing on behalf of the same 12 producer respondents that I am from the Tenth Circuit's opinion in Amerada and Sunray.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.015" offset="13091401">Mr. Caskin will discuss the question of refunds under the temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.017" offset="13115434">That issue appears only in the Tenth Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.083" offset="13127659">It is not present in the District of Columbia opinion in Sinclair and Hawkins.</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.409" offset="13169037">Mr. Wolf will also direct himself to the question of the propriety of the Commission's ordering of retroactive refunds under the unconditioned temporary certificates that were issued in District 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.380" offset="13224939">If I may, I will turn at this time to the question of the initial price in the Amerada or Sunray cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.355" offset="13260779">As previous counsel have pointed out to you the doctrine of in-line pricing had it's genesis in this Court's CATCO decision rendered in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.056" offset="13303620">At that time the Court was faced with a situation particularly on the Southern Louisiana area but not necessarily confined thereto where as a result of the rapid growth and demand for natural gas, there had been an increase in the field price of that product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.854" offset="13374777">As it rose from a waste product to a product that had premium value and became an equal partner with crude oil in the end markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.724" offset="13422320">During the period subsequent to the Phillips decision in 1954 when the Commission was told it had jurisdiction over independent producer rates, there was, as a result of this accelerated growth and demand for natural gas, an increase in fuel price levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.283" offset="13500479">The Commission at that time faced with a difficult problem of attempting to determine and develop standards for the regulation of independent producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.021" offset="13535483">As a practical matter, it was not able with the limited staff that it had to pay as much scrutiny, as this Court felt was required to the initial prices that it was certificating under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.946" offset="13587205">The Commission's position at that time was that it would do the best job it could in Section 7 proceedings but would hold until the Section 5 rate investigations, the final determination of just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.771" offset="13642480">In CATCO, this Court directed the Commission to give more scrutiny to the initial price lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.866" offset="13670797">And it remanded a Commission decision which had certificated new producer sales in Southern Louisiana that had established a new price plateau.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.443" offset="13717191">I submit that upon reading the Court's decision in CATCO, the vice which the Commission -- which the Court found in the Commission's decision was the failure to make fundings upon the record in that case that justified the reason why it was in the public convenience and necessity to approve a new, and at that time, the highest price plateau that had been proposed for that particular pricing area, Southern Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.132" offset="13847907">The Court in its opinion instructed the Commission to hold the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.142" offset="13871940">It did not attempt to spell out any précised formula as to what techniques should be used to hold the line, what was meant by the line, how the line should be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.296" offset="13928573">Within the context of the Court's opinion in CATCO, it would appear that the reference to the line was a reference to the existing level of contract prices in the field at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.650" offset="13985938">On remand in CATCO, the Commission attempted to implement this Court's directive to hold the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.434" offset="14013106">And it developed a methodology which has subsequently been referred to as in-liners or in-line pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.824" offset="14046647">This Court first had before it, a review of the Commission's in-line methodology in the Callery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.790" offset="14082487">Unfortunately, the producer respondents in Callery, did not fully briefed the question of the Commission's in-line methodology because the Fifth Circuit had held that the Commission had erred in confining its consideration to in-line evidence, and that broader evidence representations were required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.312" offset="14180603">Although the Court's majority opinion did approve the Commission's 20-cent in-line price established in Callery, 47 Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.910" offset="14223026">Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion clearly recognized that the in-line methodology had not been fully developed in Callery, and suggested that the matter would not be foreclosed for further consideration in subsequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.159" offset="14288018">Now, we have a situation where the Commission in its review of the price line in Texas Railroad District 4 for the period after September 28th, 1960, the date on which it issued its statement of initial policy, concluded that changed circumstances and current conditions required an increase in its original in-line price established for a period in the 1950s from 15 to 16 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.904" offset="14423019">I think it is important to recognize in evaluating whether or not the Commission may have erred in concluding the changed circumstances required an increase in the price line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.739" offset="14466278">To recognize that when these proceedings were started in 1961 and '62, that it was apparent that there would be a period of a substantial number of years before we would have just and reasonable rates finally established in the Texas Gulf Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.669" offset="14546004">As a matter of fact, I think that that prognosis has been shown to be correct by the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.995" offset="14579336">We do not as of this date even have the examiners decision recommending just and reasonable rates in the Texas Gulf Coast, although the hearings have been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.258" offset="14620400">And I think it would be fair to anticipate that at least an examiner's decision would be rendered shortly, possibly a Commission's decision within a year or year-and-a-half from now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.887" offset="14662928">But it's certainly fair to say that the in-line price established by the Commission in the Sunray and Amerada proceeding was the price for the decade of the 1960s in the Texas Gulf Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.316" offset="14712665">That was the price that was going to determine the extent to which interstate pipeline purchasers would be able to effectively compete for new gas supplies from the Texas Gulf Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.462" offset="14757177">It was well known to the Commission the evidence that had been brought to its attention in many proceedings that the Texas Gulf Coast is one of the most rapidly expanding industrial markets in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.518" offset="14809422">That it is a giant consumer of intrastate gas for the petrol chemical complexes and other industrial components in the Texas Gulf Coast area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.047" offset="14859577">In 1958, approximately two thirds of the new sales made in the Texas Gulf Coast were two interstate pipeline purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.388" offset="14900955">By 1961, that volume had dropped to only 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.164" offset="14924048">And today it is far below that figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.292" offset="14936586">We have been faced with a situation in the Texas Gulf Coast, for a number of years where the new purchasers by the interstate pipelines has been less than their withdrawals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.950" offset="14983189">In other words, they are liquidating their present committed reserve inventory in the Texas Gulf Coast Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.283" offset="15012551">These were the circumstances --</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.860" offset="15042853">The interstate pipelines have been unable to acquire new reserved editions equal to their withdrawals in the Texas Gulf Coast.</text>

            <text syncTime="3748.442" offset="15097187">We submit that under those circumstances it was clearly appropriate for the Commission not to feel placed in a straitjacket and bound to perpetuate a 15-cent in-line price that it had found for the 1950's and project that into the decade of the 1960's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.584" offset="15165733">CATCO just clearly cannot be read to say that the Commission as a matter of law was required to hold the line for an indefinite period into the future regardless of any changes in circumstances that might come to the Commission's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.094" offset="15239711">Since CATCO, the various circuits and the Commission itself has recognized, that in applying the in-line standard, consideration must be given to current conditions in the industry and changed circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.789" offset="15302510">Now, within the context of this case, what were those changed circumstances, what evidence do the Commission look to, to justify its judgment, that change circumstances required an increase in its 1950's price line?</text>

            <text syncTime="3825.519" offset="15405432">We were conscious of the problems that this Court had recognized and directed the Commission to adopt more streamline procedures to move these producer cases along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.242" offset="15452348">Our evidentiary presentation here was not that the individual company cost of service presentation that so dominated the producer evidence that was presented in Callery.</text>

            <text syncTime="3873.322" offset="15596648">All of the evidence was excluded on motion by the distributors and the Commission staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.644" offset="15617964">They claimed it was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.598" offset="15625801">We have pending in this Court a conditional cross petition in Number 82 which has not been acted upon, which request this Court to grant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.856" offset="15682748">In the event it concludes that the evidence that Commission did use to justify its increase in price from 15 to 16 cents was inadequate and not substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.811" offset="15734575">What the distributors have done is put the Commission in a complete vice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.857" offset="15750771">They have successfully obtained the exclusion of all of the generalized cost trend and economic evidence, supply and demand consideration evidence that the producer has brought forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.808" offset="15798627">They have confined the evidence of record to a limited area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.002" offset="15819421">And now they claim that the Commission's reliance upon the remaining evidence was inadequate that it -- the evidence that's left wasn't substantial enough to support their result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.226" offset="15864247">There go less perpetuate the price freeze at 15 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.965" offset="15883264">Now, the Commission attempted to respond to the difficult position that it was placed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.313" offset="15908655">It wanted to move these cases as long as quickly as it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.760" offset="15926418">Therefore, it rounded the distributor motions, excluded the producer presentations, and relied rather instead upon a price exhibit that was submitted by its staff which did show the trends in contracting patterns in the Texas Gulf Coast during the period from 1955 to 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.810" offset="16018578">It also looked to its initial price levels that had been approved under temporary certificates and gave consideration to the price levels which it had established in a statement of general policy, which was the product of Commission expertise and based upon six or seven years of experience in handling producer matters since 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.315" offset="16116590">It concluded on the basis of that evidence that there definitely had been change circumstances in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.529" offset="16145533">And that an increase in the price from 15 to 16 cents was clearly required by the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.790" offset="16182523">Now, we submit that what the Commission has done was proper and lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.444" offset="16209168">That although it may have been more desirable to make a more detailed analysis into these underlying economic trends and changed circumstances which were shown by the evidence that we proffered, that nevertheless certainly a general feeling for the industry problems and developments could be found from the type of evidence which did remain in the record in which the Commission utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.121" offset="16315852">We do say, however, that if you are unwilling to accept the quality of the evidence which the Commission utilized in this proceeding in supporting its initial price determination, then you cannot leave this agency in the type of straitjacket that is inherent from the distributor position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.723" offset="16390248">But you must then, we respectfully submit, grant our conditional cross petition in Number 82 and permit the Commission to enlarge the record to receive the more detailed evidence which we proffered which clearly would have supported and justified the pricing decisions which the Commission reached in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4837.666" offset="19453994">And how much will they pass on to the ultimate consumer?</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.281" offset="19476459">In this connection, Mr. Coleman had pointed out that pipelines are not participants in these proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="4853.832" offset="19518673">But his reason was that the rate increases can be passed along by the pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.068" offset="19543646">In our view, the real reason why the pipelines are not here is because, they already have their opportunity when they negotiated the contracts with the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.543" offset="19581576">And they did not feel on the position to attack those contracts which they themselves negotiated before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.142" offset="19603937">To be that, if I may, I would like to rephrase Mr. Coleman's question and ask why the distributor companies are always such active partners in these proceedings before the Commission on the Courts and if as they contend, they are simply conduits of this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.948" offset="19667153">And it's all passed on to the ultimate consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.966" offset="19679274">I think the answer is obvious and that answer is that the distributor company to do retain a large amount of the refunds which will be ordered in this case, if the Commission is sustained and larger amounts of refunds, if the distributor position is sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="4956.837" offset="19930676">Those moneys amounted according to the Commission's record, to $51.9 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="5035.865" offset="20246862">Now, for some mean, by some means known only to the distributor's interest, they determine that this line should be frozen, somewhere in the area between 14 and 15 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.950" offset="20287195">They then embark on a program of intervening in all producer certificate cases where the prices exceeded those levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.635" offset="20325961">By this method of intervention, they were able to and by prolonged litigation on these contract prices they were able to place these prices in a suspect category over a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.995" offset="20383326">As a result, the Commission under the rules announced by various circuit courts did not consider these prices when it originally determined the line in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.848" offset="20426794">I would like to also point out that during the time that the contracts in these proceedings were made, there were no in-line prices in these areas for any period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.035" offset="20475486">These contracts were made in the time period from September 28, 1960 to about the end of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.054" offset="20503594">The in-line prices were not determined by the Commission for this same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.527" offset="20525432">For Amerada, the decision came out in August of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.925" offset="20543091">For the Hawkins case, the decision in District 3 in the earlier case was decided in March 27, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.091" offset="20587708">In District 2, the decision by the Commission covering the earlier of period was in December 9, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.022" offset="20615502">In all of the Amerada sales and one of the Hawkins sales and in all but one of the Sinclair sales, there was no in-line price determined by the Commission at the time these sales were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.639" offset="20669942">Yet the distributors continued to intervene in these cases above the level which they had determined, not a Commission determined level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.060" offset="20699617">All the industry had to look to was the 18 cent guideline level which the Commission had determined, which the distributors contend cannot be utilized in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.881" offset="20746846">We have detailed further in our brief the methods which the distributors have followed in attempting to exclude all of the evidences which the Commission could possibly use to find that the price line was higher for the 1960s than it was in the 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.695" offset="20826154">I would like to focus now on the question which Mr. Justice White has raised last night and again this morning with reference to the relation between the in-line price which the Commission has determined here in just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.024" offset="20887489">And I believe it is now clear that the in-line price is the level to which refunds will be ordered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.293" offset="20928554">And it is the level if it's too high that is if it's above the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.506" offset="20957393">There would be no way that the producers can retroactively file for this difference correspondingly if in-line price is below the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.895" offset="20994905">There is no way that refunds can be required for this difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.801" offset="21010578">So really in our view, what the Commission was attempting to do here and they used the terms fair and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.732" offset="21030327">And Mr. Justice Brennan is ultimately correct that these are different sections of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.456" offset="21061151">But at least in the Commission's consideration, the standards which they use I think are very closely approached each other to the extent that they can under the limited consideration which the Commission can give the evidence in an in-line proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.820" offset="21122696">So I think it's material here to at least consider to the extent that we can whether the in-line price will be above or below the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.285" offset="21160521">Now Mr. Tell mentioned this briefly in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.655" offset="21177971">We do have some guidelines on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.585" offset="21189674">In the Permian case which was argued before this Court last December, one of the findings which the Commission made in that case was the national cost of gas for 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.145" offset="21239933">Now, of course, the national cost includes the Texas Gulf Coast area here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.050" offset="21255607">And that finding was 16.43 cents per Mcf national cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.184" offset="21280057">Now, in the Permian case as Mr. Tell pointed out, the Commission had previously determined an in-line price for that area of the 16 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.049" offset="21315584">In their price for new gas, in the Permian area, they determined that part level to be 16 1/2 cents, one half cent above the in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.642" offset="21349961">Mr. Tell has pointed out that the record is now closed in the Texas Gulf Coast area rate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.182" offset="21372113">And that the Commission staff has recommended a price for new gas and incidentally new gas as defined by the Commission on the Permian case and by the Commission staff in this case as involving all contracts dated after January 1st, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.140" offset="21439927">Now, you see there's only three months or two months difference between the dividing line on the policy statement, the definite periods selected for the in-line price, and the dividing line between new and old gas which the Commission has found different rates for in the area rate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.375" offset="21516831">The Commission staff in the Texas Gulf Coast area rate proceeding for gas delivered at a central point which is the predominant method of delivery has recommended that just and reasonable rate of 16.8 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.702" offset="21570226">And even more significantly a witness for the same -- some of the same distributor companies which are here attacking the in-line price made a recommendation for Texas Railroad District 4 for new gas of 16.25 cents, for Railroad District 2, 16.75 cents, and for Railroad District 3, 17.25 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.677" offset="21662072">Now, I should add that the cut off date which the distributors recommend is January 1st, 1963 not '61.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.262" offset="21696449">But if the Commission follows its decision in the Permian case and finds to cut off date for the reasons which they gave in that case to the January 1st, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.207" offset="21740231">Even under the distributor recommendations, the in-line price will be below with the just and reasonable rates filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.082" offset="21779728">I would like now to turn to the -- very briefly to point out two things with reference to the use of temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.661" offset="21829987">First of all, the deliveries are conducted most under these proceedings, under temporary certificates, because of interventions which the distributor companies filed which force contested proceedings, thus required a very lengthy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.262" offset="21912430">And under the circumstances there, the producers there had no alternative but to apply for temporary certificates so they can begin delivering their gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.192" offset="21948165">Secondly, the Commission did not give as I say very clearly their opinion full weight to these temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.266" offset="21980453">The temporary certificate order does consider the price question to the extent that the Commission can do so at that time under the absence of a record and all of the other situations which exist in the temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.970" offset="22031235">But they do consider the price question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.186" offset="22040116">And they do condition the price down to the guideline levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.215" offset="22056208">Therefore, the Commission thought that they could give some consideration to these temporaries in determining the in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.868" offset="22094869">And that's what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.751" offset="22098422">If they had given full weight to the temporaries, they would have had to found the price line to be higher than that which they did find.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.329" offset="22128724">Now, we believe that decision is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.122" offset="22139904">I would like now to turn to the take-or-pay clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.838" offset="22158712">And I believe there's some misunderstanding which may exist which I would like to address myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.520" offset="22185462">First of all, Mr. Simons stated that the Commission was in error in balancing between the consumer interests, as he terms himself, and the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.721" offset="22242304">We feel that the balancing which the Commission did here was on the one hand, to determine the weight to be given to the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.910" offset="22278980">In other words they will hold the price down as low as they can but there is one other important consideration and that is, if they force this price too low, they will not be able to obtain a sufficient supply for the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.835" offset="22342719">Now, this is just basic economics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.252" offset="22352332">It's true in all sections of the economy whether regulated or non-regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.499" offset="22373334">They have to weigh on the one hand, the supplies which will be brought forth by the price and on the other hand the price to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.165" offset="22411995">Now, the Commission did consider the supply question in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.923" offset="22435088">In the Commission's brief to this Court on page 19, the Commission states, “The Commissions essential duty in passing upon the applicant's initial price is to evaluate market conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.362" offset="22496841">And in this light to a say a reasonable approximation of the fair price for gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.310" offset="22520560">A figure which will presumably elicit continuing supplies for the interstate market yet protect against the danger of excessive and inflationary price proposals by the dominant supplies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.354" offset="22572805">And in the Tenth Circuit's decision in the Sunray case, they referred to this balancing between the supply problem and the price problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.898" offset="22606973">And we submit that that is the function basically of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.279" offset="22628498">It's to balances these two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.088" offset="22635708">Now, let's see what the record shows with reference to supply in the Texas Gulf Coast area --</text>

            <text syncTime="5662.486" offset="22753364">Turning back to the contract to the supply problem, the record does show because the contracts which were entered into during this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.346" offset="22792756">And it shows the volumes which were committed under those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.271" offset="22808430">We have a table which is attached to Appendix C to our brief, which shows these volumes which were committed in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5685.815" offset="22846673">And in District 3, the figures are particularly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.488" offset="22861302">The new contract volumes in District 3 declined from 33 billion cubic feet per year in 1958 to only 2.7 billion cubic feet in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.884" offset="22914905">These new gas reserves committed in Districts 2 and 3 from September 28, 1960 to about the end of 1963 were approximately 1.2 trillion cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.645" offset="22966000">During the same time period, the pipelines in this area withdrew 2.9 trillion cubic feet over twice as much from their existing reserves as they were able to compact for in this supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.134" offset="23031933">We feel that the Commission did consider this in determining that the price line should be where it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.640" offset="23061922">Now, Mr. Simons has raise at some length the take-or-pay problem of the pipeline chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.769" offset="23094418">I would like to first focus on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.401" offset="23104972">Now in our view if the take-or-pay problem is a problem, and we deny that it is, it should be -- the emphasis should be in the material facts or the take-or-pay problem existing in the pipelines buying gas in these proceedings and in these areas not in general industry-wide statistics, which is what Mr. Simons quoted to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.174" offset="23200057">Now, I like to give you the figures from the record on the take-or-pay positions of the pipelines in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6148.047" offset="24695515">And that's what the Commission meant when it said that the pipelines normally have to contract to take care of a year when they may not be able to buy it again or another year when they may have a demand which they have not previously anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6162.731" offset="24754343">The pipelines simply cannot under the nature of their operations go out and buy every year all of the gas which they need to replace the supplies which are being consumed together with all the gas they need for growth.</text>

            <text syncTime="6307.992" offset="25335306">I am William Killbourne, the counsel for the Superior Oil Company, petitioner Number 231.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.619" offset="25357876">Superior is the only party to these consolidated proceedings that has thought to review on the price findings of the Commission as well as the Court position below, due to a 15-minute time restriction, I shall limit my comments to two areas dealing with the construction of the initial in-line price for the period 1958 to 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.933" offset="25443140">I refer you to a full discussion of Superior's position on our initial brief in reply briefs filed previously with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.707" offset="25474173">The Commission Opinion 475 concluded that the proper initial certificate price for producer applicants in Texas Railroad Commission District Number 3 for the period prior September 28, 1960 was 16 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6357.116" offset="25531852">Superior challenges this conclusion and the findings there under for the reason that the Commission refused to consider all the record evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.098" offset="25563721">Specifically, the Superior's protest is the Commission's refusal to include all high volume, non-suspect permanent certificates and a computation of the average weighted price used by this Commission to ultimately determine the in-line price for such period</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.595" offset="25621713">This Court's CATCO decision in 1959 helped delay of the Commission in determining the just and reasonable rates required a most careful scrutiny of initial price proposals of the producers under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.387" offset="25672913">This Commission has since developed the in-line price technique to meet this duty under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6398.531" offset="25697468">The Ninth Circuit is now famous as UGI Case on which the Commission so heavily relies considered the in-line price technique to be a simple, direct, and effective device on which to determine the in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.902" offset="25762983">Callery said the proper and only evidence necessary to establish a price line can allow a proper evaluation of all factors bearing on the public convenience and necessity was a field price study.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.625" offset="25809899">This Court in Callery held that adequate consumer protection under Section 7 was attained through the utilization of the in-line price technique and the related suspect price doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6439.165" offset="25860054">This Court in Callery approved a certification of applications of the highest price level after elimination of suspect prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.128" offset="25891924">Prices tainted by the erroneously issued and remanded CATCO certificates were set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.981" offset="25915329">Only prices then subject to Court and Commission review as well as like prices in the same area not currently under review will regard as suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.388" offset="25952946">The general concept of the suspect price doctrine that is prices still subject to Commission in Court review was urged by the Commission and approved by this Court in Callery.</text>
            <text syncTime="6471.857" offset="25990771">And it is now urged in the Commission's initial brief in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.808" offset="26006653">It is a distorted application of the suspect price doctrine that causes the Commission to commit legal error in the record below and not the definition of the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.143" offset="26047927">Mr. Justice Harlan concurring in the line determination in Callery, said the in-line price was comparatively easy to fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="6493.563" offset="26077602">His statement is correct but I would submit that if the fixing of the line is done improperly, then the whole purpose of the stock gas measure is blunted.</text>

            <text syncTime="6699.080" offset="26899728">Oral argument was held before the Commission in a fully considered opinion issuing permanent certificates at 20 cents was issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="6711.719" offset="26950196">The Public Service Commission filed knows of intervention in that proceeding as provided for in the rules of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.117" offset="26979871">In line with the established Commission policy at that time, the Commission found that a denial of intervention was required because allegations of the would-be intervener, the Public Service Commission, failed to show a direct or immediate interest to justify their intervention as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6736.019" offset="27047476">However, in deference to Public Service Commission it was offered the status of a limited participant in the proceeding to show to the examiner that the Public Service Commission had a sufficient interest and that its intervention would be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6749.565" offset="27101602">The Public Service Commission elected not to exercise this right of limited participation and made no appearance in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.841" offset="27130755">Subsequently, an order was issued denying intervention and the Public Service Commission's petition for review with that order denying intervention was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6765.142" offset="27163982">The failure to perfect the petition for review whether the intervention in hindsight was proper or not is no more failed to the correctness of the Trunkline opinion in the 20-cent certificate therein, then would be the producers fair to brief and argue the in-line issue and the Callery case suggest that the Callery case is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.506" offset="27249351">Both decisions must be taken as correct and they have an impact on this proceeding here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6828.778" offset="27418520">And the method the Commission selected to hold the line is the in-line method approved by this Court in Callery.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.741" offset="27446314">And the Commission consistently states that the in-line price is derived from a review of only permanent non-suspect certificates when available.</text>

            <text syncTime="6854.735" offset="27522278">The Commission has selected the method and it is under a legal obligation to apply it consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="6860.249" offset="27544325">The Commission cannot be allowed to pick and choose among otherwise helpful permanent certificates no longer subject to review in order to find the price line.</text>

            <text syncTime="6878.935" offset="27619140">Full consideration of these sales raises the average weighted price to 16.92 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6885.958" offset="27647248">Opinion 475 has done a weight average place for the period involved of 15.16 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6892.881" offset="27674937">The fixing of the in-line price at the highest level of prices after elimination of property suspect prices were at some level between the weighted average price of 16.92 cents and 20 cents would result in a price line that would justify Superior's sale in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6911.222" offset="27748289">The Commission committed further error in refusing to use six permanent certificates issued by the Commission under settlement orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.564" offset="27781622">The prices of these file certificates ranged from 16 to 18 cents per Mcf and would have a clearly upward impact on the average weighted price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6928.360" offset="27816835">The Commission has made an express finding that such certificates resulted from settlements are required by the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6935.660" offset="27845987">The certificates result from proposals or producers concurred in by regulatory bodies, distribution companies, and the Commission to accept amended price levels in order to obtain permanent certificates at firm prices without the usual administrative delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.715" offset="27906278">The purposes that motivated the parties to a settlement are identical with the purposes of the producer in a contested certificate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6959.439" offset="27941177">Whatever the reasons for seeking a settlement, the obligations of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act are unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.716" offset="27970226">It may not, for its own convenience, issue an order that is not in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6971.947" offset="27991124">Settlement orders specifically find that the prices approved by the Commission are required by the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.181" offset="28016097">The permanent certificate is in all respect final and beyond review.</text>

            <text syncTime="7148.453" offset="28697161">Very much so we would deny the holdings of the lower court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7156.910" offset="28731016">The law and Commission policy is clear that where there is any objection to a proposed settlement, there is in fact no settlement to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="7164.439" offset="28761109">The prices reflect what all of these parties believed to be the in-line price at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7169.539" offset="28781484">That they've considered such sales in the average weight of price is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="7174.540" offset="28801546">The examiner categorized these settlements as other than permanent certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7178.722" offset="28818265">The settlements are obviously permanent certificates and worthy of as it is as much weight in the price line review as a contested permanent certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="7210.085" offset="28943757">Mr. Justice Fortas and this is my final point, I just want to bring to your attention here, and you ask the question yesterday whether or not, there are no permanent certificates involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="7219.127" offset="28979911">Superior believed they had a permanent certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7221.160" offset="28988061">In September of 1960, we're issued an unconditioned permanent certificate at 17.5 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="7230.122" offset="29023901">We held that certificate for over one year and the only condition -- I take it back, there was one small condition and it said that this is conditioned to the acceptance of a permanent certificate by Florida Gas Transmission, the pipeline purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="7245.422" offset="29085027">In August of 1961, a permanent certificate was issued and the same time, the Commission came out of an order resending our permanent certificate, at 17.5 cents, gave us an unconditioned temporary certificate at 17.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="7264.016" offset="29159424">So we now look in 1968 to a situation where we find the Commission may file a 16-cent price with refunds, with interests of believing in 1958 that we had a permanent unconditioned certificate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis H. Caskin</label>
            <text syncTime="7285.674" offset="29246046">Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7288.719" offset="29258271">On behalf of 12 of the producing companies who were respondents in the cases coming here from the Tenth Circuit in the Amerada cases, I will discuss the retroactive refund issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7302.447" offset="29313128">The Tenth Circuit is held but the Commission lack the power to impose refund liabilities upon amounts previously collected on the temporary certificates which contained no full wanting that refunds would be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7316.467" offset="29369240">As its opinion makes clear, the Tenth Circuit carefully considered the circumstances in which these certificates were issued as well as the terms of the certificates themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="7327.252" offset="29412394">At the outset, I wish to make clear that the producers recognized that the Commission may impose reasonable conditions at the time of issuance of the temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7338.881" offset="29458892">And this Court in Hunt in -- at 376 U.S. has recognized that this power at that time is broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="7347.187" offset="29492120">The Commission often exercises its conditioning power when it issues temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7352.889" offset="29514898">It sometimes reduces the initial price proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7356.607" offset="29529840">It sometimes imposes expressed refund conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7361.067" offset="29547604">Consequently, the absence of an express condition that temporary certificate was highly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7368.468" offset="29577279">In this case itself, the Commission exercised its conditioning power at the time of the issuance of the certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7375.838" offset="29606745">In one instance, it lowered the price proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7379.056" offset="29619597">In several other instances, it imposed the expressed refund conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7386.359" offset="29648854">This case, however, presents to the Court for the first time, whether the Commission is empowered to modify the terms of lawful temporary certificate orders, issued without refund condition by imposing refund conditions at a later point in time when a retroactive basis long after the producer has irrevocably dedicated his gas to the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7411.792" offset="29750523">A temporary certificate orders in this case not only lack their refund condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7417.008" offset="29771421">Indeed the Commission affirmatively stated that the prices authorized were firm prices subject only to prospective modification at the time of permanent certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="7430.617" offset="29825860">Now, the temporary certificates in question must be considered in conjunction with the Commission statement of General Policy No. 61-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="7440.433" offset="29865148">This became effective on September 28, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="7443.877" offset="29878836">It established great standards for various producing areas in the United States, and in particular established price ceilings at or below which the Commission would issue temporary certificates or permanent certificates in the absence of innovation without a price condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7463.567" offset="29957622">These price ceilings as evidenced by the Commission's Policy Statement were based upon comprehensive data and made available to the Commission as a result of six years of producer regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7477.580" offset="30013733">In its 1963 Phillip's decision at 373 U.S., this Court gave recognition to the significant role which the Policy Statement ceilings had had in maintaining and in some instances, reducing the upward trend of producer prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="7502.312" offset="30112580">But what I mean, they either maintain the level or reduce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7507.576" offset="30133687">And the Commission itself wanted to -- wanted to establish this Policy Statement prices found that the prices would promote effective producer regulation and I quote, “in a manner fit to all with these interests are affected by Commission regulation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7525.483" offset="30205262">There has been some contentions here that the Policy Statements -- the Policy Statement prices were pulled out to fit in.</text>
            <text syncTime="7537.319" offset="30252596">One only has to read the Commission's Policy Statement to see the comprehensive support that it marshaled for those prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="7556.483" offset="30329292">It gathered out many of the individual cost cases that had been instituted by the Commission against producers following this Court's Phillips decision in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="7573.333" offset="30396688">It also had previously issued permanent certificates in these various areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="7579.599" offset="30421765">It looked to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7583.582" offset="30437752">I must say that we were stymied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7586.929" offset="30451127">We attempted to get to the bottom of this but we were excluded from testing the basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="8079.658" offset="32422013">And as a matter of fact, every temporary certificate ever issued by the Commission contains that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="8084.814" offset="32442598">But what I'm saying is, it must be read on the context of what the Commission has said since 1955 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="8091.736" offset="32470288">Mr. Coleman deprecated our citation of the Signal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8095.749" offset="32486379">I think any reading of it, it appears at 238 F.2d will show that the Commission has not interpreted until this case that without prejudice language in the temporary certificate is a refund condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="8109.829" offset="32542699">And the February 5th order itself, shows that the Commission did not intend it as a refund condition because as I say, should the temporary certificates contained that without prejudice language.</text>
            <text syncTime="8125.424" offset="32605080">I believe, however, that the February 5th order is important in more than that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="8130.810" offset="32626604">I mean, not only does it make clear that the prices authorized on the temporary certificate were firm prices subject to modification at the time of the permanent certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="8142.406" offset="32672998">But it also articulates a well-considered Commission policy to grant temporary certificates at firm prices at or below the Policy Statement level while proscribing price increases during the period of temporary certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="8158.548" offset="32737573">Now, the February 5th order which appears in Volume 1 at page 155, and particularly, at page 158, the Commission says as to such temporary authorizations under those conditions, it's about -- about fourth line down, “We have balanced the competing interest of producers and consumers as well as given full consideration to the needs for certainty of the natural gas companies and the public general by providing that while temporarily certificated price is not subject to refund, the period, the price during this interim period cannot exceed our ceiling price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8209.791" offset="32942582">Now, this as we have shown in our brief, was a policy not limited to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8216.450" offset="32969122">It was industry-wide scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="8218.937" offset="32979153">And from the point of view of the Commission, I want to establish initially that this policy was in effect retroactively changed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="8232.757" offset="33034428">And we believe that your decision in the American Tracking Association case at 358 U.S. condemns this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="8242.553" offset="33073612">The Court while recognizing that an agency may rectify inadvertent errors in prior decisions observed that an agency cannot make such retroactive changes merely to establish a new policy on a retroactive basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="8264.376" offset="33160861">Now, Mr. Coleman contends that this policy never existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8269.289" offset="33180505">That is of issuing temporary certificates at or below the Policy Statement level or proscribing price increases during the temporary certification period.</text>
            <text syncTime="8278.545" offset="33217599">It's interesting to note that Mr. Schiff represents the Commission here never denied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8285.671" offset="33246020">All that Mr. Coleman could muster for his support was an order in CATCO on remand issued in January '62.</text>
            <text syncTime="8296.329" offset="33288652">But as this order makes clear and I'm afraid it must be read quite clearly because the Commission really mischaracterized what it was doing there but what it was doing there was imposing refund liabilities upon temporary certifi -- a temporary certificate which contained an expressed refund condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="8319.809" offset="33382588">And we do not contest that in that situation, the power to order refunds exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="9103.760" offset="36518431">I appear here today on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of Texas who is the main respondent in Number 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="9112.066" offset="36551659">We concern ourselves and address ourselves solely to the question of refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="9118.972" offset="36579244">I think it is clear at least we argue that when the Commission issued a temporary certificate to Standard fixing and prescribing a temporary rate of 18 cents, and this was done in Standard's case after the guideline Policy Statement had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="9143.927" offset="36679032">And it was a temporary certificate which prescribed an 18-cent rate that cause Standard to reduce rates it had contracted to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="9155.698" offset="36726157">The Commission was acting at that time in a legislative or a quasi-legislative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="9165.378" offset="36764923">Its action bounds Standard for the future until that action was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="9173.225" offset="36796270">If the rate thus prescribed was by its terms that is by the quasi-legislative after the Commission at that time, made subject to refund, then we do not argue that a later refund ordered by the Commission would be improper or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="9194.209" offset="36880175">And I think that this is exactly what my friend, Mr. Coleman, and my friend Mr. Schiff are arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="9200.894" offset="36906924">They are saying that the so-called “without prejudice language” in Standard's temporary certificates in effect said, that the temporary rate was to be 18 cents until a hearing on final certificate at which time when the Commission prescribed an in-line price a refund from the 18-cent rate would have to be paid down to the rate fixed as the in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="9230.064" offset="37023640">Now, one of Standard's temporary certificates particularly the one appearing in the joint appendix at pages 108 and 109 says, “This is without prejudice to such final determination of the application for the certificate as the record may require.”</text>
            <text syncTime="9254.999" offset="37123323">The other temporary that Standard received provides, and this is at the Joint Appendix 100, 101, “This authorization and the acceptance of the above rate schedule are without prejudice to such final disposition of the application for certificate as the record may require.”</text>
            <text syncTime="9274.883" offset="37202944">So the issue becomes how does one reads it without prejudice language.</text>
            <text syncTime="9280.508" offset="37225409">That question, Mr. Justice Fortas which I think you recently addressed yourself.</text>

            <text syncTime="10992.134" offset="44071894">But basically our view, however, as I said before is that the question of need may and can, and is being considered in pipeline proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="11005.914" offset="44127065">The particular pipeline facilities involved in these cases have been approved in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="11014.716" offset="44162278">But normally, in order to consider the question of need before the gas goes into the market which is the proper time to consider it is in pipeline proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="11029.962" offset="44223195">It cannot be done in producer proceedings unless you simply eliminate temporaries because as was recognized before, the gas will be flowing long before for a long time before the question of a need can be finally determined in a producer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="11048.890" offset="44298951">So in these circumstances, the appropriate place is in the pipeline proceedings and there are continuing pipeline proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="11059.040" offset="44339493">They are always asking for new facilities to pick up more gas, there are these budget facilities, we believe that these cases provide an ample opportunity for the consumer interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="11093.771" offset="44478464">Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="11098.777" offset="44498526">Mr. Tell during his presentation stated that in the prior cases, the Commission had found 15 cents as the in-line level for the 1950s and that the question before the Commission in this proceedings was to determine whether there were changed circumstances which would justify a change in the in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="11118.981" offset="44579297">I would like to comment on his statement in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="11122.305" offset="44592567">First of all, the prior in-line finding is not an in-line finding for the 50s.</text>
            <text syncTime="11127.682" offset="44614092">In Skelly, for the example, the Commission had before basically nine contracts executed in 1959 and 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="11135.423" offset="44645021">And it predicated its finding on the conditions that existed from 1958 through 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="11142.286" offset="44672502">In the Amerada case, we had contracts for the two-year period beginning immediately after Skelly from September 1960 through August 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="11153.515" offset="44717432">But in any event, the question is, what were the changed circumstances that the Commission relied on to elevate its in-line level by a penny.</text>
            <text syncTime="11161.538" offset="44749511">The changed circumstances were essentially the higher prices negotiated in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="11167.063" offset="44771662">And I think that this brings us not only to the whole suspect line doctrine but to the manner in which it was phrased by Judge Bazelon below.</text>
            <text syncTime="11176.527" offset="44809488">He said the need for the FPC and for a concept like in-line prices arises primarily because the unregulated marketplace cannot protect the consumer adequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="11187.766" offset="44854418">Congress created the FPC to protect the consumer from the marketplace, not simply to reflect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11194.027" offset="44879496">It may well be true that the marketplace was leading to higher prices of pipelines and producers who are willing to negotiate for higher prices in the 60s than they were in 1959 and 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="11206.275" offset="44928502">This fact, far from contradicting a need for holding the line for FPC control merely emphasizes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11215.645" offset="44965909">Now, the Commission attempts to say, “Well, we aren't relying on the naked marketplace as we did in the CATCO case which led to this Court's reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="11224.027" offset="44999450">We're relying on the fact that we have issued temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="11228.979" offset="45019303">But the prices contained the temporary certificates are not approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="11233.276" offset="45036440">They are not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="11234.306" offset="45040619">They are subject to revision, happy outcome of the hearing on those temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="11240.105" offset="45063816">That price is the price that obtains only during the pendency of a hearing to determine whether it should be permanently certificated.</text>
            <text syncTime="11248.410" offset="45097044">And indeed once it's permanently certificated, it can be replaced by the just and reasonable rate at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="11255.156" offset="45124002">But it's for this reason that no reliance can be placed on temporary -- temporarily certificated prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="11261.867" offset="45150856">Now, what is the difference between certificating an in-line level of 15 cents and an in-line level of 16 cents?</text>
            <text syncTime="11269.693" offset="45182098">It is just this, under both circumstances, the producer can file it up to its contract level, be it 16, 17, 18 cents, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="11278.759" offset="45218356">However, if the ultimate just and reasonable rate is determined in the area rate proceedings, turns out to be lower than 16 cents, if the in-line -- the difference between 15 and 16 cannot be recouped unless the in-line level has been fixed at 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="11298.543" offset="45297560">It's possible that the just and reasonable level could be even lower than 15 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="11303.412" offset="45316995">In that case, the consumer is just disadvantaged without any recourse at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="11337.989" offset="45455339">Now, the basis for the determination -- oh, incidentally I would say that the Commission never made any finding that there was less need for consumer protection with respect to these contracts which have the 16-cent level than it had for the contracts in Skelly which had a 15-cent level.</text>
            <text syncTime="11355.557" offset="45525556">There was in all three of these cases a diminution in the degree of consumer protection over the prior series of cases without any finding by the Commission that such diminution was proper or was required.</text>

            <text syncTime="11500.344" offset="46104743">Since you have mentioned Callery, I would like to turn right to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="11504.354" offset="46120835">At this point, in Callery, this Court twice mentioned what the standard is for fixing in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="11511.902" offset="46151032">It said at 382 U.S. 227, consumer protection is afforded by keeping the in-line price -- by keeping the in-line price at the level where substantial amounts of gas have been certificated to enter the market under contemporaneous certificates no longer subject to judicial review or in any way suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="11535.003" offset="46243401">Now, there's no question here that the Commission use suspect prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="11539.625" offset="46261896">Again the Court said at page 229, the in-line price of 18.5 cents is supported by the contract prices in the South Louisiana area that were not suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="11550.820" offset="46306617">Again there's not question that the temporarily certificated prices and the contract prices, that the Commission relied on in this case, the elevated in-line level and thereby reduced the amount of consumer protection were suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="11563.677" offset="46358131">I said in Amerada that 36 of the 38 contracts which have been temporarily certificated and were relied on for the guideline level were the very -- to fix the in-line level, were the very contracts before the Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="11577.123" offset="46411839">In Sinclair, the Commission referred to the fact and they said this out on page 33 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="11582.929" offset="46435140">They were impressed by the fact that 40% of the total volume was moving at 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="11587.651" offset="46453948">That 40% was all under temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="11591.774" offset="46470457">Three quarters of that 40% were sales to Lone Star Gathering Company which as I discussed this morning under the need issue, it was subsequently determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="11602.195" offset="46512149">There was no need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11603.247" offset="46516328">The certificates were vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="11605.227" offset="46524270">That 75% of the 40%, three quarters of the 40%, those sales are no longer being made in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="11613.883" offset="46558856">Yet, that's what the Commission relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="11615.849" offset="46566797">They relied on sales that are no longer being made in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="11619.555" offset="46581635">That fact alone, it seems to me, would require vacation of the Commissions finding that the in-line level is 16 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="11626.095" offset="46607757">I would point out too that those were all contracts that were before the Commission to determine the propriety of the in-line price for permanent certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="11635.574" offset="46645687">In the Hawkins case, the Commission seems to have shifted its basis for getting the price of a penny.</text>
            <text syncTime="11640.933" offset="46667107">And it says that its primary reliance was on three permanently certificated 18-cent prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="11647.488" offset="46693334">Those three 18-cent prices, I don't want to go into all of it, but those three prices were deemed suspect by the examiner, by the Commission staff, by the two dissenters, and we set out the reasons in Volume 3 of the appendix of pages 312, 313, why those were suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="11663.700" offset="46758222">The Commission never addressed itself to a discussion of whether or not they were in fact suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="11669.599" offset="46781733">But we think clearly under the prior court decisions, they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="11673.711" offset="46798242">Now, the Commission says, it attempts to get around this business of the fact the prices were suspect by saying, well we gave discounted weight, we didn't give full weight to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11684.043" offset="46839515">But the problem with giving weight anyway to suspect prices is the suspect prices are probative nothing at all of no factor that is relevant in an in-line determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="11692.856" offset="46874833">And you don't cure the defect of giving weight to inadmissible evidence that has no probative value by saying, you gave discounted weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="11700.898" offset="46907016">There is no question here that the discounted weight was crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="11704.012" offset="46919450">The Commission itself said in Sinclair that if we didn't give any weight, we would have arrived at a lower level.</text>
            <text syncTime="11711.118" offset="46947871">And so you had an inadmissible confession and you had no other evidence so you needed some evidence, so you let it in because it provided that the term would be reduced by one-half or one-fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="11722.115" offset="46991862">If it's inadmissible, it's inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="11724.084" offset="46999698">If it's not probative, it's not probative.</text>

            <text syncTime="11766.972" offset="47171271">At page 33 of its brief it says, it's speaking here of the Sinclair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="11770.833" offset="47186735">It says, “No doubt on this evidence, the Court examining the matter de novo might choose a different price line.</text>
            <text syncTime="11777.353" offset="47212753">There is room for arguing that the price line should be 15 cents or 15.5 cents or even as high as 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="11783.974" offset="47239293">But in the final analysis, the statute commits the decision to the expert judgment of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="11790.463" offset="47265207">Now, as I understand that they're saying based on the evidentiary record before that they could have come up with anything between 15 and 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="11798.671" offset="47298017">And I submit Mr. Justice Harlan, that that kind of standard is just too vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="11803.279" offset="47316511">It has no meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="11804.456" offset="47321213">If that's what it is, then the hearing that we had, we might just as well have forgotten it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11809.016" offset="47339395">If that, there is that much range for the Commission to pick an in-line level, then I think that the in-line determination and the protection that this Court intended in CATCO, have been a terrible waste of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="11821.521" offset="47389445">Now, I want to address myself to certain statements made by Mr. Caskin with respect to the Policy Statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="11829.247" offset="47420374">First of all, it was not possible as you pointed out Mr. Chief Justice, to take an appeal from the Policy Statement when it was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="11837.481" offset="47453288">It was issued without notice, without hearing, without record.</text>
            <text syncTime="11841.750" offset="47470320">The State of Wisconsin representing the consumer interest, filed an application for rehearing which is a prerequisite for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="11849.267" offset="47500413">The Commission rejected that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="11851.814" offset="47510653">The State of Wisconsin took an appeal to the District of Columbia Circuit that Commission defended on the ground that the Policy Statement fixes no rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="11861.084" offset="47547747">It fixes no procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="11862.732" offset="47554330">When it is applied, that is the time to approach it when it is implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="11867.761" offset="47574392">I would point out too that in June of 1962, the New York Commission filed the petition to amend the Policy Statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="11875.135" offset="47603963">That petition has been pending for six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="11877.741" offset="47614307">I don't think we're going to get any action on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11879.852" offset="47622771">When the Commission did implement the Policy Statement in a case like McDermott, we did appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="11885.425" offset="47645027">The DC Circuit said, “We don't have a full record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11887.784" offset="47654536">These matters can all be worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="11889.698" offset="47662164">We did attack specifically in the McDermott appeal, the failure to include and express refund condition, we attack the fact that the price was out of line in the temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="11898.199" offset="47696123">The DC Circuit said, “These matters, we don't have a full record before as these matters can all be determined on permanent certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="11905.632" offset="47725902">That is the time to obtain it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11907.707" offset="47734157">Now, Mr. Johnson has suggested that the distributor companies are here before you because they will retain a large amount of money if they can and that it's purely a selfish interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="11919.914" offset="47783058">First of all, a statement would not apply in any event to the Public Service Commission of the State of New York which is not a distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="11925.495" offset="47805315">With respect to the three distributors I represent, I like to state that two of them, Brooklyn Union Gas Company, Long Island Lighting Company have purchased gas adjustment clauses in their contract, the effect of which is that any dollar that they get back out of this proceeding will flow right through to their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="11941.761" offset="47870412">They will not retain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11943.153" offset="47875950">With respect to Philadelphia Electric Company, I had occasion to check what they had done with the monies they have gotten back through the end of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="11951.512" offset="47909386">They had received $4 million from their two pipeline suppliers, part of it, being producer refunds that the pipelines have passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="11959.948" offset="47943137">And they had refunded or flow through to their customers, passed on to their customers 99.6% of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="11966.757" offset="47970408">Now, I think that this is a meretricious argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="11971.024" offset="47987440">I think if there's any question at all, certainly the clients I represent would have no problem if this Court where to say that the money should flow through directly to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="11979.431" offset="48021086">We are here trying to vindicate the consumer interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="11981.972" offset="48031222">We're not trying to make the money for ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="11984.866" offset="48042820">I would point out too that as to some of the refunds that were withheld by some distributors, they may well have been used to offset rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="11990.448" offset="48065181">They may well have benefited the consumer in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="11995.521" offset="48085452">In any event, they don't apply so far as these refunds are concerned with respect to my clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="12014.624" offset="48161834">With respect to the Commission's exercise of its refund power, I would like to point out that in Amerada, the Commission declined in its original Amerada order, Opinion 422 in 1964, the Commission declined to take any action on refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="12032.043" offset="48231528">In our appeal to the Tenth Circuit, and in our appeal here, we took the position that the Commission's failure to take action was error, that it was required to act and that it was required that it had the duty to order refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="12043.551" offset="48277608">If we are correct in that contention which is before this Court, and if this Court should find that we are correct, then you don't get into the problem of the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="12054.566" offset="48321599">We accept the fact that the Commission's subsequent order Opinion 501, substantially moots our appeal on that point if 501 does satisfy our request on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="12067.757" offset="48374366">But our appeal right from the beginning was that the Commission had the power and the duty to order refunds at the time that it issued permanent certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="12078.332" offset="48416684">I think that the issue we have here in these cases is one of proper administrative standards, does the Commission have to explain in a meaningful way what it did?</text>
            <text syncTime="12088.651" offset="48457958">Does it have to provide adequate protection for the consumer?</text>
            <text syncTime="12093.089" offset="48475721">We would ask that you find that the Commission must make a finding of need before it certificates, that it must hold the line at the level that it previously found and not elevate it by reference to temporary certificates and that refunds were required to make the consumer hold for the out of line amounts paid.</text>
