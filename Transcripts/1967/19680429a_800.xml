            <label>Mr. Frank M. Wozencraft</label>
            <text syncTime="35.988" offset="247306">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.625" offset="261831">I'm appearing on behalf of the Civil Aeronautics Board, petitioner in number 946.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.341" offset="288684">The petitioner in the other two cases was consolidated here for oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.175" offset="312090">Our six supplemental air carriers in number 800, and the American Society of Travel Agents in number 969, and the argument on their behalf will be presented by Mr. Jerrold Scoutt, with whom I will share petitioner's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.478" offset="377292">In all three cases, the respondents are Pan American, TWA, and American Airlines, regularly schedule trunk carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.694" offset="422118">These cases are here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.190" offset="452106">That Court struck down and has begun the CAB statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.081" offset="471646">Several related orders which certified supplemental air carriers to engage in inclusive tour charters involving foreign transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.073" offset="511666">This decision is in direct conflict with the prior decision of the U.S.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which had affirmed CAB orders, authorizing inclusive tour charters in the domestic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.646" offset="569971">American Airlines versus CAB which is reported at 365 F.2d 939, and is included as an Appendix to the petition for the supplemental carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.928" offset="623052">These two decisions were based on the same provisions of a 1962 statute, amending the Federal Aviation Act, Sections 401 subsection (d) and (e) and 101(32) and (33) of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.254" offset="684387">They involved orders issued in the same proceeding, the supplemental air service proceeding which had begun in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.543" offset="717511">They we're not these -- orders were not separated on appeal because the domestic orders did not require presidential approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.353" offset="748753">And that to the domestic orders were appealed by the trunk lines, and upheld by the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.575" offset="773622">The orders involving foreign transportation, received the necessary presidential approval in September of 1966 along with additional orders, issued in the Trans-Atlantic proceeding of the Board, in which the inclusive tour phase had been reopened in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.972" offset="843212">After the hearing examiner's report in the supplemental proceeding, the trunk lines did not ask this Court to review the District of Columbia decision which became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.817" offset="886680">Instead, they appealed to the Second Circuit from the CAB orders involving foreign tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.473" offset="913220">Thus while only foreign tourists were involved in this case, this Court's decision on the merits, well obviously, controlled domestic tours as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.730" offset="954284">Moreover, a decision limiting the Board's power here could also cast a serious cloud on a 1965 decision by a different panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the so-called Split Charter Decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.603" offset="1013739">American Airlines versus CAB which is recorded at 348 F.2d, 349.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.769" offset="1042474">That case held that the Board had authority under the 1962 Amendments to define Charter so as to permit the supplementals to split the charter of one plane between two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.098" offset="1091793">And the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia relied on that case and cited it and quoted from it, in reaching his decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.695" offset="1126170">In my statement, I will attempt to discuss the principal issue in this case, the essential facts, and the background and history of the 1962 Amendments through the conference report stage where it was presented to the Congress in the form in which it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.297" offset="1192521">Mr. Scoutt will deal with certain statements made by members of Congress when the conference committee report reached the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.016" offset="1223450">He will also discuss the general role of the supplemental carriers in the air transportation industry, and certain procedural objections of respondent to some of Board's orders which were not reached below.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.922" offset="1279039">In our view, the principal issue here is one of the Board's expressed authority under the 1962 statute, to permit charter trips by supplemental air carriers, is restricted by the Act's legislative history to exclude charters to tour operators who organize group tours including more than just air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.647" offset="1373915">A respondent's brief seeks at its beginning to shift the emphasis to whether inclusive tour arrangements can be considered as charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.857" offset="1414771">But the inclusive tours authorized by the CAB under the contested orders are clearly based on a contract between a carrier and a tour operator acting as principal not agent, which is a charter within every accepted meaning of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.497" offset="1485406">The tour operator is an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.524" offset="1497422">He pays a single price to the aircraft on a time, trip, or mileage basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.459" offset="1521246">The economic risk is entirely his no matter how many or how few passengers are actually carried, he pays, and the supplemental carrier receives the same lump sum price for the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.204" offset="1588224">In our view, this concept comes squarely within the authority of the Board under the 1962 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.727" offset="1618317">That legislation climaxed years of controversy as to the place of the nonscheduled or supplemental carriers as they're now called in the transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.752" offset="1658337">Its basic purpose was to establish a stable and useful role for that creative segment of the industry, without jeopardizing the regularly scheduled carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.473" offset="1701282">In our brief at pages 9 through 12 discusses that history as to the opinions of both the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank M. Wozencraft</label>
            <text syncTime="423.752" offset="1798353">Correct, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.333" offset="1800756">This is a difference between this and another provision whereby the supplemental carriers themselves can charter the plane to groups where there is a preexisting connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.604" offset="1849762">In the case of the tour operator, however, no such connection is required but he cannot split a charter with any other tour operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.138" offset="1883930">He has to take the whole plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.422" offset="1893021">And the group is formed by the choice of the itinerary which he offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.845" offset="1914755">Affinity in the view of the Board is provided by the fact that these people are all signing up for the same itinerary.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.438" offset="1949132">And in doing that they accept of course, considerable rigidities as the Board and Courts recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.031" offset="2027499">It may as far as the contract with the supplemental carrier is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.544" offset="2041501">But the Board requires a prior authorization of each of these chartered trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.214" offset="2068250">And the tour operator must submit a filing to the Board along with the airline.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="498.294" offset="2096567">What does he include along with the air transportation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_m_wozencraft" startTime="500.573" stopTime="1173.687">
            <label>Mr. Frank M. Wozencraft</label>
            <text syncTime="500.573" offset="2105657">He must include at least hotel reservations and ground transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.755" offset="2126346">In practice, there are usually a great many other items included.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.370" offset="2140871">It also as always around trip situation, it comes on back to where it started I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.359" offset="2160828">And so you have a package tour, it's the customary vernacular I believe in the travel agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.760" offset="2190399">There's this where people sign up for a particular package.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.831" offset="2206699">It is not simply point-to-point transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.099" offset="2219760">The man who go and takes that trip must go on that particular plane, at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.186" offset="2244106">He does not have his choice of the schedule of the air carriers as a member of the public dealing directly with the airlines would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.169" offset="2284022">Now these 1962 Amendments attempted to accomplish the role that the supplemental carriers should have in this industry by authorizing them to engage in chartered trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.051" offset="2339610">And according to statute now, charter trips in air transportation to supplement the schedule of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.186" offset="2368136">It did not authorize them to provide individually ticketed point-to-point transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.925" offset="2395094">In previous days before these amendments, the supplemental carriers have been authorized to run a limited number of regular point-to-point trips a month and this statute, terminated their authority to do that with a two-year interim delay period for them to phase out on it, but it left them with full authority to conduct chartered services as authorized by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.378" offset="2492897">Now in our view, this provides a classic example of a kind of situation in which an administrative agency like the CAB is best equipped to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.003" offset="2535424">Recently as this past January in Horton versus Kentucky Utilities, this Court reemphasized the established rule within questions of statutory interpretation involving agency authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.283" offset="2584534">The agency's own determination should be set aside only where it lacks reasonable support in relation to the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.242" offset="2616299">We also cited page 23 of our brief, the several other cases that reflect in recent times as long established doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.267" offset="2652453">Now, the word charter which we're talking about defining here has been in the Federal Aviation Act since it's enactment in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.279" offset="2684531">It is never been defined in the Act itself, only by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.048" offset="2703548">And the determination as to what kinds of charters the supplemental airlines should be permitted to make, involves exceedingly intricate questions of economic facts and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.459" offset="2753181">As the hearing examiners recommended opinion -- this decision in his opinion and the opinions of both Courts, the Second Circuit and the District of Columbia Court both indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.192" offset="2808142">And in fact as early as 1961, the Board added to the issues in its transatlantic proceeding, the question of whether the supplementals should be authorized to charter their aircraft to tour operators for all expense tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.685" offset="2874075">And they pointed out there in 1961 that that this was very different from individual ticketing. This appears at pages 644 through 646(a) of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.053" offset="2919633">Now this authority was not granted by the Board in the initial orders in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.136" offset="2939904">They determine in their discretion not that they did not have authority to do so, but at the time considering the present uncertain financial condition of the trunk lines, this authority should not be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.460" offset="2989223">The transition into jets from propeller aircraft had left the transatlantic carriers in a situation where their financial situation was not yet nearly as solidified as it later became.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.652" offset="3049932">But this issue again then became presented in the supplemental service proceeding which was initiated in 1963 under the amended act.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.371" offset="3088906">The examiner's recommended decision after lengthy contested proceedings concluded that the supplemental should be authorized to charter aircraft, to tour operators for their use in package tours which as I mentioned before include hotel accommodations, ground transportation, and usually many other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.751" offset="3170408">The Board issued a careful opinion in the supplementary proceeding which considered and rejected the contentions of respondents brief, and accepted the examiner's recommendations in almost every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.285" offset="3220564">I invite the Court's particular attention to the portion of the Board's opinion beginning at page 336(a) of the appendix in the supplementary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.235" offset="3260270">And again in the transatlantic proceeding which was decided later, the portion of the Board's opinion beginning at 1063(a) of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.210" offset="3304260">The Board concluded that inclusive tour charters and arrangements fall within the customary meaning of chartered trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.311" offset="3340622">It drew a clear distinction between scheduled point-to-point transportation and packaged tours where a tour operator organizes a group of people willing to accept certain rigidities and itinerary to achieve an overall saving and particularly in the situation with foreign tourists to avoid the trouble of making separate arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.373" offset="3428916">The Board found that such inclusive tour charters would meet a substantial public need for relatively low cost pleasure tours which was not then being satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.176" offset="3476041">And then it would do so without an adverse effect upon the scheduled service of the trunk lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.462" offset="3505194">The Board then issued regulations which Mr. Scoutt will discuss in more detail to assure that this authority could not be used as simply a disguise or a sham for individual ticketing point-to-point operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.736" offset="3562350">They included such requirements as a minimum price of a 110% of the lowest schedule airline fare, a requirement of at least three stops and many other things which would make this kind of tour thoroughly impractical from the standpoint of the business traveler or one who is going for personal affairs to a particular point at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.152" offset="3652002">Now the Board certified these supplemental carriers on a temporary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.780" offset="3670497">It recognized that this was an experimental program as its opinions reflected drew upon British Air Tour experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.034" offset="3699545">It drew upon ICC experience in the motor carrier field.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.440" offset="3717099">And it assured the industry that if further regulations were needed, if there was more protection needed for the schedule carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.270" offset="3756492">The regulations could be amended to provide it but it expressed every confidence that this could be achieved and that new markets, new interest of people that would otherwise not travel either because of the expense or because of their lack of sophistication and how to make arrangements for themselves would be generated by this innovative development.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.284" offset="3840502">It was innovative that is as far as the U.S. Air Transportation business was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.829" offset="3858683">As I say it was not innovated as far as either British Air Transportation or U.S. Surface Transportation, and they have been added as I mentioned before as early as 1961 to the list of questions to be considered by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.233" offset="3920332">Now turning now to the 1962 statute itself, there's nothing on the fix of that statute that even suggests that the Board acted beyond its authority in authorizing this kind of supplemental program.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.680" offset="3978115">On the contrary, its authorization were and the words of the statute for charter, trips, and air transportation in both its opinion and its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.253" offset="4020433">The Board clearly limited its grants to inclusive tour charters which would supplement the schedule of service of the route carriers rather than disrupt or divert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.152" offset="4059930">The only question therefore is whether the legislative history of these 1962 Amendments limits a plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.791" offset="4098487">The principal issue posed to Congress in 1962 was whether the supplemental should be restricted to charter service, or whether they should be permitted to engage in a limited amount of individually ticketed transportation as they had raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.473" offset="4161285">The Bill passed by the Senate would have allowed them both to engage in charter and in limited point-to-point service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.390" offset="4188975">On point-to-point service, the CAB was required to prevent any significant diversion from a regular carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.608" offset="4217814">No such limitations were required for charter service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.183" offset="4236100">The Senate Bill defined charter service as the engaging of the entire capacity of an aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.483" offset="4257311">But the definition excluded individual ticketing but expressly included inclusive tour charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.602" offset="4285733">The senate committee report made it clear that it did not intend to permit individually ticketed service to be offered under the guise of a charter by either an air carrier or a travel agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.902" offset="4330977">It then noted however that an all expense pay group tour could be offered to individual members of the public and still conform to the traditional concept of charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.879" offset="4386879">The report stressed that if a travel agent charters an aircraft and offers the public a chance to participate as members of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.996" offset="4419375">This is a very different sort of service from individually ticketed transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.083" offset="4451662">The House Bill, unlike the Senate, did not allow the supplementals to engage in any individual ticketed point-to-point service, nor did it define chartered trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.164" offset="4484054">It simply defined supplemental air transportation as charter trips and air transportation to supplement the schedule of service offered by the regular carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.787" offset="4530552">And this is the language that the Congress adopted when it enacted the 1962 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.160" offset="4556048">It's particularly important therefore to note the meaning here also of the house committee report on this Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.765" offset="4582484">And it explained very carefully the reason for omitting a definition of the term charter even though the Senate Bill which had already been reported out by the committee and the senate reported and discussed all of these matters would have included such a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.017" offset="4639431">The house omitted it because and I quote again authority to define charter services should be left as at present with the Board, subject to the limitations contained in the reported Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.687" offset="4702124">This is a very difficult subject and any effort to freeze a definition of charter service in the law could well lead to complications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.015" offset="4747473">The report made it very clear that the committee expected the CAB to use this flexible authority in a way which would protect the schedule of carriers against unfair or discriminatory competition from individually ticketed service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.569" offset="4849664">Yes, sir, he later remarked on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.214" offset="4864188">This report made it clear -- the report said nothing which would restrict the Board in anyone from authorizing any kind of charter services which it determined would result in unfair competition or a detriment to the schedule of carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.306" offset="4928554">And when the two bills went to conference, the conference committee adopted the Court provisions of the House Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.759" offset="4954363">This resulted of course in cutting out the senate definition of charter who had been utterly inconsistent with the idea of leaving flexibility to the Board to define the term, to go ahead and include any definition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.489" offset="5009324">It's important I think to note though that with this whole inclusive tour charter completely called its attention, the committee report and the House Bill did nothing to exclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.833" offset="5058748">Now since this report -- since the conference report gave no explanation for its adoption of the House version on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.003" offset="5091349">So I think the only fair conclusion is that it intended to adopt the meeting as expressed in the House report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.503" offset="5117367">And that Bill unmistakably left the CAB, the flexible authority to define charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.860" offset="5146833">We have then the following situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.511" offset="5157386">Two bills came into the conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.190" offset="5172120">The Senate Bill, which would expressly authorize the CAB to grant certificates permitting inclusive tour charters, and the House Bill which would leave the CAB with flexibility to authorize inclusive tour charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.625" offset="5229902">It seems utterly anomalous to us, to assert that by choosing between these two provisions without -- the conference committee somehow intended to deprive the CAB of authority which it would have had under either Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.306" offset="5300642">When the committee history is this clear cut when no amendments were made following the conference committee report, it's difficult to see how comments made individual congressmen, when there's no showing of who was on the authority here can be permitted to contravene in this history under any accepted theory of legislative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.824" offset="5386637">The Board should not be thus deprived of authority which it feels it must have, if it is to be able to meet the changing needs and conditions of this rapidly evolving industry and carry out the policies entrusted to it by Section 102 of the Federal Aviation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.413" offset="5652982">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.874" offset="5666879">As a preference to my argument, I would like to say a few words about the petitioners for whom I'm speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.910" offset="5694986">The American Society of Travel Agents is the principal trade organization for the travel agents who operate some 2600 agencies throughout United States and Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.338" offset="5740753">The six supplemental petitioners hold certificates to engage in interstate and foreign air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.883" offset="5774921">They largely operate jet aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.372" offset="5784848">They operate under the same safety standards as to the scheduled airlines in performing charter service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.786" offset="5810552">And they are members of a group of supplemental carriers that totals 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.701" offset="5834167">These 13 are the remnants or the survivors of a group that at one time numbered almost 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.568" offset="5869693">These carriers are probably better known by their former name as non-scheduled or non-scheds but at least they officially require their present name as supplementals in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.422" offset="5925073">One of the important characteristics of this group, which I don't think has been mentioned yet, is that they have played a very creative role in the development of air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.938" offset="5971153">This will appear in the senate report which has been attached to the legislative materials which accompany our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.581" offset="6005739">That Senate report gives these companies credit for developing the military contract business, credit for developing the charter business, credit for developing all cargo service, and credit for first promoting and developing the Air-coach business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.703" offset="6078151">In other words, this small group of carriers which never has accounted for more than 3% of the industry's total revenues have produced innovations and competition which have literally reshaped the entire industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.517" offset="6145442">Now it was partly, I believe in recognition of this contribution that Congress decided that they should be given a permanent and a stable role in air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.709" offset="6194239">And the principal question as to whether or not, the Board in implementing that decision has exceeded its powers depends on the treatment that you will accord, the statements that were made by six congressmen on the floor of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.735" offset="6258291">And it's to that issue that I should now like to turn.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.923" offset="6339062">The six congressmen who spoke on the floor of Congress were these, Senators Thurman, Scott, and Cotton, Congressman Harris of Arkansas, Congressman Williams of Mississippi, and Congressman Collier of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.797" offset="6402591">This entire legislative history with which we are now concerned, you of course realize has been examined on three separate occasions in lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.250" offset="6444387">Two of those courts in looking at the same legislative history, have said that Congress intended to leave to the agency the job of defining the term charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.726" offset="6490258">But the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit treated these statements as constituting a binding congressional declaration which withdrew from the Civil Aeronautics Board, the power to make this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.447" offset="6549191">Now that conclusion is the thrust really of the argument that I would like to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.166" offset="6572074">And there are three points that I would like to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.943" offset="6583150">The first is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.467" offset="6593285">We do not believe that the floor statements provide any reasonable explanation for the conference committee action or the silence of its report on the subject of all expense tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.118" offset="6651800">You recall that the conference committee adopted without change and without comment, the House Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.565" offset="6681684">And the report that accompanied the House Bill, said that the job of defining charter should be left to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.768" offset="6714493">We are now asked to believe that what the conferees had in mind was a really a caveat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.548" offset="6737586">That the agency was not to define the term charter, to include a particular kind of charter, that something was reserved from this delegation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.932" offset="6779068">Now if indeed, the conferees were concerned about this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.033" offset="6799548">If they were as concerned as the six congressmen, all of whom incidentally were members of this 17-member conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.705" offset="6830164">If they were as concerned as the six congressmen, why wasn't there one sentence in the conference report on the subject of all expense tours?</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.175" offset="6872064">It seems totally unrealistic to us to believe that a concerned majority of the conference committee would have cast to the subsequent floor debates to make known its view on withholding the opportunity from the CAB to certificate inclusive tour charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.231" offset="6956283">Rather we think that the most plausible explanation for the senate and floor statements is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.841" offset="6986689">That a few days before the floor debates, a staff member of the Civil Aeronautics Board in the transatlantic proceeding, filed a brief in which he recommended all expense tour authority be granted to the supplemental airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.042" offset="7055548">And that we suggest that these floor statements are a manufactured response to that recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.000" offset="7083342">That they were designed to influence either the agency or subsequent Court action, and indeed Senator Thurman statement on this matter, recites the fact that the Board had just -- a staff of the Board had just shortly before made what he called an intolerable suggestion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.444" offset="7617181">My first point, Mr. Justice is simply, that if the committee had felt the way Mr. Harris felt, they certainly would have put something in the committee report to this effect, because the committee was adopting word for word the House Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.152" offset="7679979">And the report that accompanied the House Bill said that the definition of charter should be left to the CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.498" offset="7705370">Now if Mr. Harris didn't want someone to draw the conclusion that the Board was free to define this term, it seems to me he would have urged the committee to say something about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.117" offset="7811845">But I believe that is true that at the time this legislation was being considered, the Board did have authority to authorize inclusive tour charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.044" offset="7851551">In October of 1961, that's roughly eight months before this legislation was enacted, the Board had placed this issue in the transatlantic investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.376" offset="7892825">The Senate report recites that all expense tours are part of the traditional charter concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.212" offset="7920201">Something like this almost identical to it had been followed in the United Kingdom for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.285" offset="7940472">And something reasonably similar to it had been followed at the Interstate Commerce Commission for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.022" offset="7963460">So that there should have been no surprise to Mr. Harris that this was a possibility and that had his committee felt the way he felt, it seems to me we would have seen something in the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.024" offset="8027512">The second objection that we have to the use that has been made by the Court below of the floor statements is that they cannot be reconciled with either of the statute or with the house report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.765" offset="8086444">That report is we've just been discussing says the definition should be left to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.351" offset="8108805">But the use, to which the Court below puts these statements, is to limit that delegation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.407" offset="8137017">It is if you please to freeze a restriction on the charter definition by saying it does not include inclusive tour charter type authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.109" offset="8175783">Now in this kind of a conflict, we think the house report should be given a greater weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.989" offset="8203368">As I've said before we certainly recognize that this Court has frequently looked to debates as aids in statutory construction, that we can find no case except the case here on review where those debates had been used to introduce an ambiguity and to vary what we think to be the clear language of the report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2360.350" offset="9544808">And my only three arguments about it, my first one is that if they really felt strongly about it, why didn't they say something in the conference report?</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.909" offset="9578977">It was easy to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.812" offset="9586604">And they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.530" offset="9593501">And we think that the silence of that report really is a very significant fact in interpreting the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.786" offset="9626520">The third point, if I may proceed that constitutes our objection to the use that has been made of the floor debates is that they are not entitled too much weight because the tours that were authorized by the Board were not the kind of tours to which these congressman objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.600" offset="9725785">It's clear from the statements that were made on the floor of the House and the floor of the Senate, that what the congressmen were concerned about was phony tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.411" offset="9764968">They were concerned about these airlines offering a passenger a hamburger, and a taxi ride and calling it a tour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.196" offset="9796106">They were concerned about tours that would permit cut rate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.475" offset="9817318">They were concerned about tours that would be subterfuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.695" offset="9830170">And three or four of them in actually use that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.487" offset="9845321">What they were concerned about, I think this is obvious from reading the statements, is that these charter airlines by means of this tour authority would be placed in direct competition with the scheduled carriers for individually ticketed point-to-point transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.851" offset="9914807">That was the thrust of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.340" offset="9920763">Let me digress here just one moment to make a point that I think needs clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.722" offset="9942288">Passengers on a charter flight are issued tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.301" offset="9960573">The ticket will identify the passenger, it will identify the airline, the destination, the time of departure, and in case of international flights, will specify the limitations under the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.835" offset="10010728">The fact that the passenger has a ticket doesn't make him an individually ticketed passenger in the sense we're using this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.949" offset="10043120">When we're talking about individually ticketed service of the type operated by the airlines, we are basically talking about point-to-point competition, about going out to the Washington Airport and buying a ticket to San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.860" offset="10094843">That's the kind of service that the Congress was trying to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.232" offset="10112293">Now whether the inclusive tour authority which was authorized by the Civil Aeronautics Board was indeed a charter or whether it was a disguise for this point-to-point transportation about which the Congress may spoke is not a matter of the label that you apply to this thing, but rather it depends on the substance of the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.965" offset="10215215">And we think that if you will look at the examiner's report, if you will look at the Board's decision, you will see that they have gone through a very careful analysis to balance the interest of the scheduled airlines on one side who needed protection in this point-to-point market, and the interest of the public on the other hand in desiring the benefits of low cost group pleasure transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.034" offset="10315525">And I suggest that you consider also part 378 which is the Board's regulation that defines these tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.756" offset="10346350">And the significant characteristics of this regulation are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.988" offset="10363277">An inclusive tour must cost 10% more than the individual ticket between the points in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.762" offset="10394415">Nobody going from here to San Francisco is going to pay 10% more to ride on a supplemental airlines inclusive tour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.213" offset="10424195">They simply are not competitive for this type of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.226" offset="10440286">These tours must be round trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.649" offset="10450004">They involve a minimum of seven days duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.724" offset="10466304">They require three overnight stops at three different locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.423" offset="10485112">And they can only be sold by tour operators that are thoroughly regulated by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.833" offset="10510712">Whenever a tour operator wants to conduct the tour, he has to put together his entire plan of operation, file it with the Civil Aeronautics Board 90 days in advance of the first flight, serve copies on all of the scheduled airlines that might have an interest in the case and await their comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.740" offset="10590333">The entire package or the entire program has been outlined in the Board's rule making -- under its rule making authority and can be revised if it fails to meet its expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.578" offset="10637667">As Mr. Wozencraft indicated, it's a temporary program in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.628" offset="10909863">The final point to which I should like to make a few comments concerns the procedural questions which have been raised by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.282" offset="10940479">There are three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.885" offset="10946957">First, they claim that the certificates of two carriers were amended without hearing as required by your decision in the Delta case, and secondly they claim that when the Board took official notice of certain materials that should have accorded them the right to rebut or explain these materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.967" offset="11019264">The simple answer to these arguments is that they were not raised before the Civil Aeronautics Board and your consideration of them is barred by Section 1006(e) of the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.949" offset="11071195">The third procedural question they raised is this; that the record before the Board in 1963 as supplemented by the material of which the Board took official notice was not an adequate basis for the decision in the transatlantic case in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.248" offset="11140368">In other words, they're saying that the Board abused its discretion by not reopening the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.032" offset="11167535">Our answers to this are two fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.884" offset="11174954">First of all, we think the agency must have broad discretion in deciding whether or not the record is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.843" offset="11202748">And secondly, all of the arguments raised by the respondent carriers as to the need for a rehearing were very carefully covered by the Board in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.284" offset="11244544">You will see these arguments summarized on page 81 of respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.046" offset="11263561">They talk about certain international problems which are really policy questions, not evidentiary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.908" offset="11286967">They talk about the role of the travel agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.114" offset="11295848">This was settled by the rule making proceeding in Part 378, and didn't require further hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.303" offset="11320613">And finally, they talk about the financial condition of the industry both scheduled carriers and the supplemental airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.063" offset="11351646">And this is discussed in detail on the basis of officially noticed material filed in large part by the respondents themselves, and set forth in detail in the opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3608.414" offset="14537017">Well, I think the most direct answer I can give Mr. Justice is this -- right up to this very moment, charter trips under Section 401(e) off route does not include the right to individually solicit even for the certificated carriers does not include the right to individually solicit or ticket the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.320" offset="14644642">Historically in air transportation, the term charter had a well understood meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.491" offset="14681318">It meant not simply the lease of an aircraft for air transportation purposes, but it meant that when the so-called chartered aircraft was used for charter purposes, excluded was any patronage for that charter being derived from solicitation of the general public in individual ticketing of the general public or the use of travel agents to fill that airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.526" offset="14801481">Charter groups were not groups formed for travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.961" offset="14823215">They had to be groups that preexisted that utilized the aircraft in effect as a charter it does for its own purposes and not as is done here by a travel agent who in turn walks right outside and says, I have an airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.512" offset="14901373">You buy a ticket for me and fill that airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.116" offset="14915793">That is not charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.194" offset="14924152">That concept of charter would practically destroy charter as a legal concept in air transportation because it would mean that supplemental air carriers would enjoy the very same individual ticketing privilege of the general public that only the certificated carriers are supposed to have under their certificates which incidentally supplementals could have if they wanted to apply for certificates and were prepared to assume the financial burdens as well as the benefits of that kind of certification.</text>
