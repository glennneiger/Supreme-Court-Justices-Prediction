            <text syncTime="26.298" offset="248890">We are here today because the Idaho Supreme Court has misread the requirements of the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.221" offset="276580">By imposing three rigid preconditions to the admissibility of hearsay statements of unavailable child witnesses, the court has made it almost impossible to get this kind of evidence into the fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.695" offset="326526">In essence, the court has held that the confrontation clause requires the hearsay declarations of child sex abuse witnesses to be videotaped, the product of non-leading, open-ended questions and elicited by an interviewer with no preconception of what the child should be disclosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.108" offset="404162">The State of Idaho submits that this three-part test cannot be sustained by a reasonable reading of the confrontation clause, and that it is in fact in conflict with the purpose of the clause to advance the accuracy of the truth determining process in criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.702" offset="466542">In its effort to protect the confrontation rights of the defendant, the court has made it extremely difficult to get reliable hearsay statements made by child victims and witnesses before the trial courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.079" offset="4720008">In our view, the Idaho Supreme Court made a legal error in this case that's best summed up by pointing to three critical factors that the court did not consider or even mention in its opinion:</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.739" offset="4778627">First, the corroboration in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.273" offset="4788762">This Court and others have pointed out again and again in the confrontation clause context and others that the degree of corroboration for a particular statement is a very important indicium of reliability of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.450" offset="4845500">The second, the spontaneity of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.585" offset="4862010">While the Idaho Supreme Court is very critical of the doctor for asking leading questions, the court overlooks the fact that the one... the one response that the child made which is the critical response in this case,</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.790" offset="4994921">But I think what's important in term... determining whether it bears the indicia of reliability is that it was spontaneous and volunteered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.146" offset="5024282">It was not a nod or a yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir type response to a doctor's leading questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.466" offset="5049569">Third is the fact that this child, the younger child was in the custody of the defendants until just before the physical examination, and so the theory of the case, the theory of defense in this case, which is that the second set of parents must have... or somebody else must have programmed this child to make these statements, just won't wash with respect to this child, this younger child, because she wouldn't have had any opportunity to be programmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Thomas Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="3450.567" offset="13946039">Thanks, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.319" offset="13957011">We're not here to suggest that the Court permit all hearsay statements of young children in, or that unreliable statements be permitted in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.711" offset="14002568">What we're asking is that the trial court be permitted to look at all of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.467" offset="14037572">And if the Court finds that there are guarantees of trustworthiness, as required both by Roberts and by the Idaho Rules of Evidence, that the statement go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.690" offset="14078532">In this case, we had a young girl who was taken out of the home of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.428" offset="14105386">The next day she was examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.165" offset="14128374">The doctor found vaginal injuries that occurred two or three days before, at the time she was in the custody of both of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.556" offset="14173931">At the time the doctor finished his medical examination, he asked her some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.044" offset="14199949">When he drew a figure, she added a penis to it... a two-and-a-half-year-old girl doesn't necessarily know what a penis is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.649" offset="14234326">She, in response to questions, volunteered a statement that Daddy does this to me, but he does it to my sister a lot more than me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.255" offset="14276749">There was corroborating testimony IN... over and above those circumstances from the older girl to talk about the sexual abuse visited on both of the girls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.448" offset="14333487">And in addition to all that, in the Giles case, the Idaho Supreme Court said this statement... by a majority opinion, they said this statement is reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.156" offset="14380299">And they gave it their stamp of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.707" offset="14390539">The only reason we're--</text>
