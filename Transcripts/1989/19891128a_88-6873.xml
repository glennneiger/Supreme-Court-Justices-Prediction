            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Resnick</label>
            <text syncTime="19.375" offset="211742">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.514" offset="220310">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.128" offset="238805">In this appeal, Petitioner contends that the decision of the miss... the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision to save Petitioner's sentence of death from constitutional error violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to have a jury weigh and balance permissible aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances, as required by state law, and violates his Eighth Amendment right to have the lawful sentencing authority consider and give effect to his evidence in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.282" offset="379344">Mr. Clemons was convicted of capital murder for his involvement with two others in a felony murder in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.937" offset="405988">Following the conviction, the court held a sentencing hearing, and at this hearing Mr. Clemons offered substantial evidence in mitigation that was sufficient to support findings of a number of statutory and non-statutory mitigating circumstances under Mississippi law.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.836" offset="477564">These mitigating circumstances included the youth of the defendant... Mr. Clemons had just turned 18 at the time of the offense; his expression of remorse at trial; his substance abuse, both chronic and at the time of the crime; organic brain damage sufficient to impair his judgment; his chances of benefitting from a rehabilitation program while incarcerated, and his lack of any prior criminal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.856" offset="589682">The prosecution did not offer any additional evidence at the sentencing hearing, choosing instead to argue the evidence that was presented at the guilt trial in support of the two aggravating circumstances that were submitted to the jury by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.567" offset="644539">Those two aggravating circumstances were the robbery and the especially heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.104" offset="682677">The trial court did not provide the jury, in giving the instructions, any limiting construction of the especially heinous aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.718" offset="721130">No definition whatsoever of those terms were given to the jury as they considered the capital sentencing determination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.645" offset="752895">In closing argument, the prosecution focused virtually exclusively on the especially heinous aggravating circumstance in urging the jury to impose a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.002" offset="798243">After deliberating overnight, the jury in fact returned a verdict of death, and in particular the jury specifically rejected the prosecution's trial theory that Mr. Clemons actually killed, or even intended to kill, the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.284" offset="867415">The jury expressly found that Mr. Clemons contemplated lethal force.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.886" offset="889776">The jury found both aggravating circumstances to exist, and found that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the two aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.584" offset="932617">While Mr. Clemons' appeal was appending to the Mississippi Supreme Court, this Court decided Maynard v. Cartwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.768" offset="961352">In light of this development, the Mississippi Supreme Court requested supplemental briefs on the issue of the constitutionality of the especially heinous aggravating circumstance in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.017" offset="1010357">The bottom line of the Mississippi Supreme Court's opinion in this case is that the invalidity of an aggravating circumstance will not suffice to overturn a sentence of death, as long as a single valid aggravating circumstance remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.528" offset="1080366">The state contends that the Mississippi Supreme Court could employ two methods, two alternative methods, to reach this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.791" offset="1109414">First, the state contends, or claims, that the Mississippi Supreme Court may independently reweigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances in an effort to cure the constitutional error in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.690" offset="1168973">Second, the state has also contended that the Mississippi Supreme Court may apply a Zant v. Stephens analysis to the facts of this case to show that the jury's consideration of the especially heinous aggravating circumstance was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.893" offset="1233861">It is Petitioner's contention that neither alternative is constitutionally sufficient to save the penalty of death in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.971" offset="1266148">First, there is no evidence whatsoever that the Mississippi Supreme Court actually reweighed in a meaningful fashion the one remaining aggravating circumstance, that is the robbery, against the mitigating circumstances to eliminate the constitutional error in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.651" offset="1340859">The only hint, the only hint of reweighing by the Mississippi Supreme Court comes in the proportionality review section of the Mississippi Supreme Court's opinion below, that is at the joint appendix page 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.511" offset="1396343">In that section, the Mississippi Supreme Court wrote, in our opinion, after a review of those cases coming before this court and comparing them to the present case, the punishment of death is not too great, when the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are weighed against each other, and the penalty will not be wantonly or freakishly imposed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.701" offset="1641058">In other words, when the circumstances, or the balance struck in this particular case was compared to the balance struck in other cases in Mississippi, the court found that this case was not disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.640" offset="1692780">What I am suggesting, what Petitioner is suggesting, is that the court cannot eliminate the constitutional error in this case, and the Mississippi Supreme Court has never said that it has the ability to reweigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.326" offset="1727575">As a matter of fact, in the text of the opinion, the court specifically stated, when reviewing the sufficiency of the jury's finding in aggravation and the balance that was struck, that they are bound by the jury's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.446" offset="1780029">That appears in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.318" offset="1791523">They are bound by the factual findings of the jury, suggesting that you do... they do not undertake a reweighing, an independent reweighing of the evidence, as, for example, this Court noticed in Barclay and in Goode.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.209" offset="1847112">The Florida courts have a different procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.573" offset="1856516">Under those procedure... under Florida procedure, the trial court, the sentencing authority, makes findings of fact, both in aggravation and in mitigation, and justifies those findings of fact by their review of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.400" offset="1919837">And then the case goes up on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.123" offset="1926733">In this case, the Mississippi Supreme Court, when it receives the case on appeal, does not have any findings of fact on the issue of mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.181" offset="1966962">The only findings of fact are made in aggravation in Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.325" offset="2439569">The jury, which is the only lawful sentencing authority in Mississippi, could accept or completely reject that testimony on the basis of its credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.482" offset="2472170">It could assign a relative weight to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.590" offset="3312581">Unlike the Georgia scheme, which was before this Court in Zant, the aggravating circumstances, in this case the jury was instructed to consider two, the label of aggravating circumstance sticks with the jury throughout their consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.711" offset="3373081">In this case they considered one aggravating circumstance, in exact language of the especially heinous circumstance in Oklahoma, that this Court has already declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.568" offset="3416548">One of the two factors upon which the jury could predicate a death sentence, has been declared unconstitutional, because it goes to the heart of arbitrariness under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.807" offset="3465450">In this case there is every reason to believe that the jury relied upon this aggravating circumstance in coming to its conclusion that death is the punishment that should be imposed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.095" offset="3518635">The prosecution obviously thought that this was its strong point.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.358" offset="3531696">It argued the especially heinous aggravating circumstance virtually to the exclusion of the robbery circumstance, in urging the jury to come to a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.804" offset="3561476">Moreover, in arguing the especially heinous aggravating circumstance, the prosecution used the broad, and exploited the broad nature of the especially heinous aggravating circumstance as a vehicle to put before the jury evidence of personal sympathetic characteristics of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.180" offset="3651024">The prosecution argued, as a reason to impose the death penalty under the especially heinous rubric, the fact that the victim was an honest person, that he was law abiding, he was a good person, worked hard, educated.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.209" offset="3703059">Indeed, the prosecution stated that this victim would have done more, and would have accomplished a lot more in life, if it were not for the senseless, heinous, atrocious and cruel murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.078" offset="3754573">This is precisely the reason why an automatic rule of affirmance, without any particularized analysis as to prejudicial effect, is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.576" offset="4100539">The especially heinous aggravating circumstance was the vehicle for introducing the victim evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.467" offset="4168144">The defendant's youth, his expression of remorse, the brain damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.031" offset="4186429">And moreover, the fact that the jury found that he was not the actual killer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.774" offset="5365388">In addition, this Court also stated in Caldwell, in the opinion in Caldwell, that the consideration, when this Court enunciated the right, or developed the right of a defendant to have mitigating evidence considered, it was contemplated that that consideration of mitigating evidence would occur among those who were before the court, who saw the witnesses testify, heard the evidence and heard the arguments of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.003" offset="5478237">That would not be the case if the Mississippi Supreme Court were independently to make its own factual findings in mitigation, assess relative weights to the aggravating and the mitigating and then reweigh themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.868" offset="5545737">The essence of Petitioner's argument is that the Mississippi Supreme Court cannot apply an automatic rule of affirmance to federal constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.468" offset="5612088">That is, federal constitutional error is, of course, a federal question, and that this Court has the power and jurisdiction to review Mississippi's determination to determine whether or not there has been any prejudicial effect upon the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.208" offset="5671125">Even in Zant v. Stephens, this Court did not end its analysis with the discussion of the structure of the Georgia sentencing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.376" offset="5711771">It went on to determine whether the error in that case, and once again it was a vague invalid aggravating circumstance, whether the... that vague aggravating circumstance may have had an effect upon the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.823" offset="5765584">There, the evidence was properly before the jury, the evidence of the prior conviction was before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.227" offset="5791184">So Zant v. Stephens doesn't compel a rule of automatic affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.191" offset="5807066">The Court still looked to determine whether or not the unconstitutional factor had an effect upon the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.068" offset="5830576">And the Mississippi Supreme Court has not done that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.098" offset="5846668">It should not be forgotten that the function of an aggravating circumstance in Mississippi sticks with the jury throughout their deliberation process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.670" offset="8380963">And I think that the... and the decisions of this Court since that time have tended to obliterate the distinction, especially the opinion in Franklin, between weighing and non-weighing states there, in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.833" offset="8449613">Franklin has talked about that there is not a great deal of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.706" offset="8469048">Even in Georgia, where the aggravating circumstance takes you across that threshold, and then they can consider everything that they, that can be put in in Georgia, there is, the jury does something with all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.514" offset="8516277">At that point it is a weighing process there with the jury, at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.649" offset="8536862">And in any harmless error analysis, I think, there is an amount of weighing by the appellate court when the harmless error analysis is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.906" offset="8577926">In addition to the weighing process in Mississippi, of course, there is always, as the instruction in this case, the jury then has to make a determination that the death penalty is appropriate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.226" offset="8635187">This, of course... the evidence underlying this aggravating circumstance that is vague because of the instruction, was certainly admissible in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.547" offset="8700493">So we have a similar situation that we have in Barclay, Zant and Goode, where the evidence that went to the jury was certainly admissible for all respects before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.046" offset="8746468">It is just how the jury was to apply that that we have problems with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.449" offset="8768098">The Fifth Circuit, as Justice White mentioned a while ago, the Fifth Circuit has approved this in several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.182" offset="8794952">In fact, in one case, instead of... it went ahead and made the analysis of itself, and held that this aggravating circumstance did not... the invalidity of this aggravating circumstance did not require reversal of the case, and affirmed, and that was in Stringer v. Jackson, and affirmed a death penalty sentence there on the federal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.279" offset="8887425">So, the Fifth Circuit has recognized Mississippi law and upheld it in several situations, Edwards v. Skargy, and in the latest, of course, is Stringer v. Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.326" offset="8935595">The other circuits that have looked at this, the Eighth and the Tenth and the Eleventh, have all agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.073" offset="8966524">The Ninth Circuit for a while had agreed, and I think with the ruling in Adamson v. Ricketts they have, the en banc ruling, has changed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.869" offset="8997766">The new Shafer ruling had been before that, and had adopted a, this, the Zant type analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.993" offset="9026188">The... of course the Court has said, in Satterwhite, that the... that it held that a state supreme court can, or appellate court can apply harmless error analysis to capital sentencing errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.824" offset="9097554">And of course, this culminates in a line of Adamson... Adams, Franklin and Penry, that there is not really a great deal of difference between weighing states and non-weighing states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.722" offset="9145202">So we contend that the Satterwhite harmless error analysis should apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.458" offset="9172055">The invitation was there in Maynard, in the concluding paragraphs of Maynard, the... this Court invited the courts to reconsider, and it said that it was for the states to determine what effect an invalid aggravating circumstance would have on a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.002" offset="9258259">They... the point being in there, in Maynard, was that the federal appellate court was not to do what the state supreme court would not do at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.472" offset="9304131">Of course, the Arizona Court of Criminal Appeals has changed its standpoint at that time, and now follows much the same as the Mississippi Supreme Court, by affirming if there are invalid aggravating circumstances, after a reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.362" offset="9363690">The Mississippi statute, of course, does require jury sentencing at the initial situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.248" offset="9415203">But the Mississippi Supreme Court has interpreted that it can review and affirm a death penalty case even though there is an invalid circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.595" offset="9452611">And we would submit that that is... is a matter of state law, an interpretation of state law in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.895" offset="10585802">That's that... the additional ground in both Zant and Barclay that the court has relied on, not just the fact that the issue, or the evidence that went to the jury was not inadmissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.197" offset="10827069">One thing puzzles me, you say that the Mississippi court can't review facts, but on page 50 of the joint appendix, the Mississippi Supreme Court, in every capital case, I gather, complies with the provision of the Mississippi code that requires it to make an independent finding that the punishment of death is not too great when aggravating and mitigating circumstances are weighed against each other, and the death penalty will not wantonly or freakishly be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.011" offset="10970325">How can they make that finding without reviewing facts?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Resnick</label>
            <text syncTime="2712.331" offset="10983595">Your Honor, there is a history to that, that provision, because that question occurred to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.985" offset="11002194">This language, in the further review opinion, predates the 1977 statute in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.541" offset="11036467">Before 1977, there was a... and let me back track.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.946" offset="11062067">Prior to 1977, there was a statute in Mississippi that required a mandatory death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.319" offset="11083487">In Jackson v. State, the Mississippi Supreme Court construed their statute so as to make it constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.396" offset="11123820">And based upon this Court's opinion in Gregg and in Proffitt, the Mississippi Supreme Court, in the absence of any specific statutory prohibition, gave themselves the authority, construed their statute to give them the authority, that existing statute to give them the authority that they could undertake this type of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.321" offset="11203546">Since 1977, when the... when the Mississippi legislature and the people of Mississippi committed the death sentence determination to the jury, this language has appeared almost as if in boilerplate in the Mississippi Supreme Court's opinions from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.953" offset="11274077">But the history of it dates back to a time when the Mississippi Supreme Court did not have, there was no statutory prohibition against it, undertaking some sort of proportionality reweighing to compare the balance in this case against the other cases that come before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.296" offset="11351399">But that doesn't... that does not cure the constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.749" offset="11365296">The state has conceded that the weighing here, and of course this is aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the plural, that if indeed there was a reweighing here, what the court did was include the very unconstitutional factor that it was trying to cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.072" offset="11434573">That's no cure at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.954" offset="11442096">In Barclay v. Florida, one of the principles that this Court relied upon in affirming the death sentence, was that the Florida Supreme Court does not apply its harmless error analysis in an automatic or mechanical fashion, but rather upholds death sentences on the basis of this analysis only when it actually finds that the error is harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.027" offset="11534361">That was crucial to this Court's opinion in Barclay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.820" offset="11549512">I would urge the Court to take a look at the case decided at footnote 6 in the state's opinion, page 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.935" offset="11573962">A reading of that... those opinions will show that what the Mississippi Supreme Court has done, although, as the state agrees, that is all dicta in the sense that it wasn't necessary to the opinion because they affirmed the especially heinous aggravating circumstance in any event, what they have done is automatically affirm, that one remaining aggravating circumstance is sufficient, notwithstanding the fact that, for example in this case, it undercuts half of the state's case at the death penalty phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.348" offset="11703634">In conclusion, Petitioner requests this Court to reverse the judgment of Mississippi, and vacate the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.762" offset="11741355">Thank you.</text>
