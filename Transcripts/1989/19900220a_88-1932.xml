            <text syncTime="12.391" offset="195849">The issue in this case is whether the Federal Special Assessment Statute must be struck down on the ground that it is contrary to the Origination Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.948" offset="246109">There are two subsidiary questions here.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="374318">--Well, Your Honor, we felt that the issue on which there was a conflict among the lower courts at the time we filed the petition and a conflict among the circuits at the time we... this Court addressed the petition, was the... on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.362" offset="439728">There was no conflict on the justiciability question.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.964" offset="450177">Now, we did advert in the petition to the issue of justiciability suggesting that at minimum the question of... on the merits should be addressed with an eye towards the problems with justiciability and, therefore, that the merits should be viewed with... by extending great discretion to the... to the House in deciding whether an Origination Clause violation had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.128" offset="538785">But, no, we didn't directly raise... raise the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.330" offset="547562">We... we do think, however, that the point does have merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.830" offset="557593">And since the Court has directed the parties to address the question, we... we have done so and we believe that... that would be a perfectly legitimate ground for a decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.470" offset="596150">And... at... at bottom what... what this issue presents, the whole political question doctrine is summed up, I think, well in a quote from Coleman against Miller which was reiterated in Baker against Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.278" offset="651425">And that is it deals with the appropriateness of attributing finality to the action of the political departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.967" offset="678174">There are a lot of different kinds of political questions, as the Court discussed in Baker against Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.371" offset="703774">There are political questions in which there is a textual commitment of the issue to one branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.524" offset="732404">There are cases in which there are strong prudential reasons for the court's not becoming involved in a particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.547" offset="764483">Issues involving foreign affairs figure prominently in that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.999" offset="782246">This case is a somewhat different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.801" offset="793426">It doesn't... there is no direct textual commitment in the Constitution of this issue to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.872" offset="817772">But we believe that when you look at all the factors bearing on the question of justiciability of Origination Clause questions, that you conclude that indeed it is not appropriate for the Court to interfere with the judgment that was made by the House and by the legislature as a whole that there was not Origination Clause problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.601" offset="900633">This is as Alexander Hamilton--</text>

            <text syncTime="190.720" offset="909201">But, Mr. Bryson, does that mean in some other case one would not defer?</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="195.541" offset="928427">--No.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.157" offset="930935">Our position is that with respect to the Origination Clause challenges, that they are subject to political question doctrine across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.897" offset="965834">Now, one could say, and this is a backup argument that we make, that certain kinds of Origination Clause questions are simply not for this Court to second-guess the House on.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.538" offset="1024453">And only if there is a very clear obvious Original Clause violation should the Court interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.275" offset="1047337">That would be somewhat analogous to the position the Court has taken in cases involving the question of whether a particular person is a member of an Indian tribe or recognizing an Indian tribe, an area that was discussed in Baker against Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.701" offset="1101044">But our initial position is that Origination Clause questions as a whole are nonjusticiable.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.599" offset="1292679">The House... I think Alexander Hamilton put this well when he said in The Federalist that the Origination Clause question is essentially the exclusive privilege of originating money bills which belongs to the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.525" offset="1348372">If the House of Representatives is satisfied that the Origination Clause privilege has not been violated, then it can pass the bill that is sent to it by the Senate and the President can sign it and that's the end of the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.044" offset="3054481">But suppose it had, it recognized it as a potential problem for Origination Clause, instead of simply deciding finally and for once that this was not in the House's view an Origination Clause problem, they would have had to go through the exercise of taking the statute that had been presented to them by the Senate and putting another House number on the top of it and sending it back to the Senate simply to ensure that that statute would be invulnerable to constitutional attack in the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="767.038" offset="3214455">It's important, I think, to point out that in two hundred years there's only been one statute which has ever been struck down on Origination Clause grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.292" offset="3247474">That was struck down by a district court and the opinion in that case, I think, is manifestly incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.767" offset="4645338">In Millard there was a project to do railroad construction in the District of Columbia which the Congress said, here's the railroad construction project and we're going to impose a property tax within the District of Columbia to pay for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.729" offset="4713152">Now, I think in that case the House might very well argue that this should have originated in the House and would very possibly reject the Senate's effort to originate that kind of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.453" offset="4764039">But this Court's precedence would suggest that if the decision is for this Court to make, this Court would say no Origination Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.199" offset="4847108">And I think in part what the Court is doing by setting the limits very broadly for what is going to be permitted in this area... what the Court is doing is responding in part to the... the difficulty... the... the... the reluctance to interfere with the resolution by the House and Senate of Origination Clause problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.030" offset="4930386">They are, in a sense, deferring very broadly without actually calling the question a political question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1225.745" offset="5049296">There's no reason to distinguish between a tax on everybody in the District of Columbia than a tax on everybody in the District of Columbia and a tax on everybody in the country for purposes of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.299" offset="5079493">Now, the Respondents argue that there is a difference between this case and some of the other Supreme Court cases that we have relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.939" offset="5125991">And that is, they say, that in those cases there was a quid pro quo, the person who was paying the tax was getting a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.045" offset="5158488">First of all, we think that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.830" offset="5169563">If you look at the Nebeker case, for example, there's no direct benefit, no quid pro quo for the national banking associations that were picking up the bill for the creation of a national currency system that was to benefit everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.804" offset="5217524">But, in any event, there's a more basic objection to that point, which is that a... there is no logical difference between a tax that is a... or a fee that is imposed to... for which one pays for a benefit and a fee that one pays in order to compensate the government for a cost that one has imposed on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.019" offset="5318357">Let me give you an example that I think illustrates this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.785" offset="5329433">Suppose there is a $100 fee for using the Yellowstone National Park because of a littering problem and the $100 fee is to be used to pick up the litter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.458" offset="5364123">It can't make a difference in the constitutionality of that statute as to whether it is deemed to be a fee which is a benefit to a person going into the park so that he will enjoy the park's litter-free aspect versus a case in which he is being charged a fee because of what he may have contributed, or members of his class may have contributed, to the costs of picking up the litter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.394" offset="5471852">It's the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.160" offset="5474883">It is just two sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.660" offset="5480943">In this case you have a class of people... people who have committed crimes... who, as a class, have imposed costs on others... the victims of crime... and Congress has decided to impose on that class, the people who have committed crimes, the costs, or some of the costs of that event, which have been suffered by... by victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.891" offset="5557848">There is a one-for-one, quid pro quo of sorts... a negative quid pro quo that's perfectly consistent with the Respondent's argument except that isn't a so-called benefit to the... to the member of the class that's paying the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.067" offset="5614585">Finally, on origination, I would point out that this statute passes almost any test you could possibly imagine for origination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.391" offset="5663800">The House was the first chamber to propose special assessments in the form that they first passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.279" offset="9283431">But I think a reading of those three cases compels the conclusion that it's a pay as you go.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.966" offset="9314151">And in this case the incidental revenue test simply doesn't work unless it's a you pay, you get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.455" offset="9344140">Because in reality, the question that Justice O'Connor asked, could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.490" offset="9364202">The Senate could originate special purpose legislation, identify a class of people to be taxed, identify a purpose and avoid the origination requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.779" offset="9409341">We could write the Origination Clause out of the Constitution, if the incidental revenue test is read in any manner other than to compel a direct relationship between the person paying and the person receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.653" offset="9456884">The government, in order to defeat the revenue raising argument, has also argued that the clause... that the assessment provision is in reality a penalty, a criminal sanction and they point really to two... two identifiable things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.817" offset="9529505">One, the assessment is a consequence of a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.185" offset="9542984">Yes, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.835" offset="9545596">Two, the amount of the assessment differs between a felony and a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.339" offset="9567643">Yes, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.272" offset="9571405">But that is where the similarity with penalties stops entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.974" offset="9586138">It is not in the sentencing provisions of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.993" offset="9598259">It is not identified in the statute in Title 18 that identifies sentencing options... probation, fine, imprisonment, notice to victims, forfeiture and restitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.726" offset="10125201">The argument that the government makes today on where did the bill originate, when you get right down to it, what the government seeks to do is to have... is to shield from scrutiny a Senate amendment of a House bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.201" offset="10183088">The government in reality says the House passed a bill 648, the joint resolution, and the House passed 5690 and the House sent 648 over to the Senate and then the House sends 5690 over to the Senate and by means of a staple, the Senate packs the two together and sends them back to the House.</text>

            <text syncTime="2651.226" offset="10751199">It calls upon the Court to evaluate the test for origination and the government suggests there can be a variety of ways to originate bills.</text>

            <text syncTime="2678.294" offset="10859451">Right now, if the Senate passes a revenue bill and sends it to the House and the House is now considering a revenue bill and it's the same revenue bill, let's say.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.053" offset="10918488">The House will not simply insert its own language after the enacting clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.146" offset="12598892">Sure, the national banks associations could have stop being national banking associations and wouldn't have had to pay the tax that was imposed on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.002" offset="12634314">But I could avoid the income tax by quitting my job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.120" offset="12646749">The fact is that as long as they wanted to remain in the national bank system, they were required to pay the tax for a benefit which the Court specifically described as being for all the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.677" offset="12697008">So this isn't a quid pro quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.367" offset="12735774">"a direct relationship between the person paying and the person receiving. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.202" offset="12751030">The person paying here is the person who is engaged in crime.</text>
