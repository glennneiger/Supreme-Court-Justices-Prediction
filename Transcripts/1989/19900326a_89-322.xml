          <turn speaker="george_h_cohen" startTime="17.843" stopTime="187.972">
            <label>Mr. George H. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="17.843" offset="215159">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.664" offset="230414">In this case the United Steelworkers of America negotiated a collective bargaining provision with the Sunshine Mining Company giving the union the right to accompany a state inspector in his state mine inspection, and as well to accompany a company representative, the safety engineer, in periodic tours of the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.077" offset="320066">The steelworkers union thereafter exercised that right which was provided by the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.266" offset="348801">The Supreme Court of Idaho ruled that solely by virtue of having exercised that right, the union assumed the affirmative duty under Idaho tort law to exercise due care in inspecting, and made it clear that what it meant by that was that the union had an obligation to detect any safety hazards that could have or should have been detected in the course of a reasonable inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.868" offset="471263">The issue presented in this Court is whether the Idaho state tort law is preempted by the Federal duty of fair representation which governs the union in the conduct of its functions in administering and enforcing a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.914" offset="547436">We bring to this Court a case that has gone through summary judgment, extensive discovery and a spectrum of undisputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.972" offset="591635">Insofar as the collective bargaining agreement is concerned, that agreement, as I stated, makes clear that the union has these two particular roles in accompanying the state mine and the company inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.766" offset="654852">The contract begins by referring to the fact that the company will continue to assume its responsibility to provide a safe and healthful work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.157" offset="704380">The company then agrees to provide the union the limited role that I have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.745" offset="730711">The contract does not provide that the union has a right on its own to inspect the mine, and the contract does not provide that the union shall be entitled to correct any defects or deficiencies that might be noticed during the course of either of these types of inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.474" offset="817647">Indeed, the limited nature of the union's role is reflected in part by the fact that the union, under Federal law, did not have the right to even accompany a Federal inspector during the Federal inspections of the mine, and the company would not permit the union to do so.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="187.972" offset="895596">Well, Mr. Cohen, if the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement are clear, although they give the union very little authority, and perhaps the Supreme Court of Idaho has piled on a lot of responsibility commensurate with that authority, I don't know that that goes to the preemption question.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.016" offset="967799">The preemption question, I thought, was whether the Court would have to interpret the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_h_cohen" startTime="211.337" stopTime="220.793">
            <label>Mr. George H. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="211.337" offset="989114">Well, with two... there is two aspects of the preemption issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.705" offset="1006564">One would be the question of interpretation, but there is a more threshold proposition, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="220.793" stopTime="223.895">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="220.793" offset="1026940">So you don't rely on the interpretation aspect?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_h_cohen" startTime="223.895" stopTime="256.682">

            <text syncTime="784.511" offset="3281830">Our position is that insofar as that aspect of the union's conduct is concerned, the union has a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.483" offset="3321640">Now, when this Court and the basic national labor policy reviewed the question of how do you accommodate the interests of individual employees, their bargaining representative, and the company, when you have that kind of conduct taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.428" offset="3393425">And the line that was drawn, the effort to accommodate all those competing interests, which comes right out of the core of the National Labor Relations Act when a union is conducting its activities, was to say on the one hand the union is going to be the exclusive representative, the representative of everyone in that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.194" offset="3476494">But with that extraordinary grant of power we have to accommodate the interests of individual employees against such abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.364" offset="3509199">And the balance that was struck was designed to assure on the one hand employees' rights would be protected, but on the other hand the union would be left in a position that it could be a viable collective bargaining representative and serve the interests of everyone in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.242" offset="3580670">And out of that combination of interests and concerns came the Federal duty of fair representation, a duty which says the union must act fairly to all the people in the unit, that it must exercise its discretion in complete good faith and with honesty of purpose and that it cannot engage in any hostility or discrimination against anyone or treat anyone arbitrarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.936" offset="5815498">They didn't, they disclaimed ever relying on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.822" offset="5826992">And after all these years of summary judgment proceeding, it is absolutely clear that that was good judgment because they could not make out a breach of the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.530" offset="5873908">Now, if the Idaho state law decision were to stand, in essence what that court has said is merely by accompanying the inspector they determined that we assumed an affirmative duty to inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.140" offset="5944334">And here is where the union would be left in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.359" offset="5957186">Either we would have to in fact achieve the right to inspect, to conduct our own inspections, a right I might add that there is nothing to suggest we would ever achieve from this employer or perhaps any other employer, given the state of this record that they wouldn't even allow us to accompany the Federal inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.655" offset="6034404">So we would either have to do that so that we could have in fact a meaningful inspection right, or we would have to choose not to participate in circumstances where what the union did was make the following judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.783" offset="6098874">We are going to have rank and file employees accompany the inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.252" offset="6116742">We are going to use the union's representative, the rank and file employee status, as a means of communication to allow the miners who are actually on the job, who are facing possible hazards, to notify, to communicate with the union so in fact those concerns could be passed on to the inspector or the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.350" offset="6213186">That was the judgment that the union made as to how it was going to conduct its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.056" offset="6244011">And to set aside that, to allow the state law to function in these circumstances, would in those circumstances in essence undermine the union's right to have made this judgment, a right which is at the heart of the duty of fair representation and the accommodations that have been made when you have the three parties at work, namely the individual employee, the union and the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.572" offset="10813976">Under the collective bargaining agreement they had set up a joint safety committee consisting of union as well as management individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2738.899" offset="11099338">Our position is that they were not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.973" offset="11855635">It doesn't have a lesser duty of care, and can't be given a lesser duty of care with regard to that particular aspect of its undertaking, or it would do violence to the fact that here we have a duty which would normally be owed by an employer, where they would owe due care, but now, because the employer can shift it to the union, the union does not owe the due care.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.469" offset="12565643">I want to just remind the Court we are here on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.957" offset="12583616">The state of the record is undisputed in the following regards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.159" offset="12600334">Firstly, that the only reason the union was actually performing and the basis for the performance of its functions was a direct result of Article IX, the safety and health article of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.251" offset="12652788">That is Einar Pederson's affidavit in Joint Appendix page 47a.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.870" offset="12671178">He was a member of the local union safety committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.690" offset="12686538">Thereafter, the actual conduct that the union engaged in was totally consistent with the limited role that was given to it under the collective bargaining agreement, the role in relevant part of accompanying these inspectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.800" offset="12754979">There is absolutely no record evidence to indicate that the union on its own conducted any inspections of this mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.108" offset="12796148">Insofar as the question concerning whether the union assumed any of the employer's responsibilities to provide a safe and healthful work place, the trial court, after the full summary judgment proceedings, found, at page 100a of the appendix, that in fact the union did not assume the employer's role or responsibility for safety and health at this work place.</text>
