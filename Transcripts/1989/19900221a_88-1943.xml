            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149228">We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1943, Office of Personnel Management v. Charles Richmond.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="51.933" stopTime="286.282">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="51.933" offset="356954">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.837" offset="376493">This is an estoppel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.372" offset="390704">The issue is whether the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Civil Service Disability Retirement System, is estopped from applying and enforcing a statute passed by Congress on account of misinformation, misinformation provided both orally and in writing in the form of an outdated OPM form, which was furnished and provided to Mr. Richmond in San Diego by Navy civilian personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.013" offset="553186">It is our position that the court of appeals erred in applying estoppel over Judge Mayer's dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.701" offset="591951">But more than that, it is the submission of the United States that estoppel does not and indeed properly cannot run against the government in the execution of laws passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.228" offset="658093">Indeed, for almost two centuries this Court was clear and emphatic that the government, acting as it must through its employees and agents, cannot be estopped from asserting its rights and executing the law, subject always to the overriding demands of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.445" offset="754955">Across the judicial generations beginning with Chief Justice Marshall's Court in 1813 in Lee against Monroe and Thornton; in the wake of the Civil War in 1868 in the Floyd Acceptances case; the turn of the century in Pine River Logging Company; at the close of World War I in Utah Power and Light; and in more modern times, Justice Douglas' opinion for the Court in United States against Stewart; and Justice Frankfurter's opinion in what has become viewed as the seminal case in this area, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation against Merrill.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.438" offset="922975">Through all these generations, the Court was clear and it was consistent that in the execution of public law the government, in contrast to a private party, cannot be estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.484" offset="991102">And in our view there are powerful reasons, both legal and practical, why this historic principle is sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.923" offset="1032898">The legal reasons are found in basic principles of democratic theory, and the very nature of our system of divided powers among co-equal branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.563" offset="1079396">As this Court held in INS against Hibi, and then reiterated less than two years ago in INS v. Pangilinan, estoppel, a venerable judge-made doctrine, cannot override a public policy established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.161" offset="1165809">That is our first point and it's our most fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.714" offset="1180020">That it is the primacy of the elected branches in our representative democracy in establishing the law that renders estoppel against the government inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.955" offset="1236967">This basic principle of our government of the responsibility of Congress, consistent with the Presentment Clause, to enact laws that bind the people--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="286.282" offset="1294332">May I ask a question about your theory?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.686" offset="1311886">I suppose it might be possible for the Executive Branch to deliberately try to thwart the policies set by Congress, for example, in a benefit program, if the Executive thought that program was unwise and unfortunate and, therefore, in their policy they would just make it a policy not to tell people about deadlines, or do anything they could to discourage people from taking advantage of the program Congress has set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.990" offset="1449186">Now, under your theory, no estoppel is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.561" offset="1467471">And yet under those circumstances the Executive would be thwarting the will of Congress.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="335.215" offset="1490041">--Under those circumstance I would quite agree that the Executive would be actively seeking to subvert the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.321" offset="1526508">That was the view of several--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="346.487" offset="1535076">But there would still be no estoppel.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.737" offset="1536121">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.803" offset="1540405">In our view there would still be no estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.969" offset="1549078">In fact, that was the view of several members of this Court in the Hibi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.307" offset="1570394">That the Executive was deliberately not carrying out the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.027" offset="1593277">And yet this Court determined that estoppel should not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.812" offset="1608428">And there is a reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.095" offset="1613548">If, in contrast to the run-of-the-mill case... and we believe this is, while very unfortunate for Mr. Richmond, a run-of-the-mill case of error... of what Justice Frankfurter in Merrill called "ignorant innocence".</text>
            <text syncTime="383.123" offset="1681675">There was no malevolent motive on the part of the civilian personnel in San Diego animus directed at Mr. Richmond for any reason whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.831" offset="1728487">There was a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.950" offset="1736950">That is the run-of-the-mill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.402" offset="1746772">If, in fact, there were at higher levels of the Executive an effort to thwart the law, then it seems to us, and we submit to the Court, that the appropriate place for redressing that kind of grievance is in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.614" offset="1819602">That Congress itself knows full well how to step in, either through public law, passing a public law to address what Congress perceives as a subversion of its will--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="433.306" offset="1882400">And would this... the result be the same if there were an active intentional misrepresentation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="439.277" stopTime="496.612">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="439.277" offset="1906328">--Under our theory, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.912" offset="1920852">Even if it is knowing and intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.883" offset="1936735">That is not the run-of-the-mill case, I hasten to add.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.001" offset="1949169">But our theory of the case is quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.517" offset="1959200">In fact, it is all the more odd where there is active subversion for that... for that... to be given effect by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.177" offset="2009878">It seems to us that the appropriate province of Congress is to address that sort of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.163" offset="2037777">I do hasten to add that in none of the cases, save for Hibi, has that extreme example even been suggested, although there have been actions by very senior officials of the government that have been called into question, such as in the Floyd Acceptances case.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.292" offset="2110292">The action of the Secretary of War himself was said to give rise to an estoppel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.952" offset="11872983">The government, in fact, does not dispute that as a matter of fact the reliance was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.272" offset="11894299">Their entire argument is based on a legal fiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.897" offset="12052810">I'm... I'm speaking to that now because that has proven to be a problem in past cases before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.468" offset="12071096">Now, as I indicated earlier, in the Merrill case this Court did use a very strict interpretation of that presumed to know maxim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.240" offset="12110175">It received a fairly sarcastic dissent from Justice Jackson, but that was the decision of the Merrill case, we are all presumed to know the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.559" offset="12139432">But since then, that has been severely undercut in several decisions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.380" offset="12158658">By the Moser case, by the PICCO case... in both of those instances the law was out there, it was available to the individuals, and they were not presumed to know the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.355" offset="12206619">The Court in effect found estoppel and found that they had reasonably relied even though theoretically they could have found out what the law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.711" offset="12240056">I think more important is this Court's 1984 decision in Community Health Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.615" offset="12263670">In that decision, the Court found that the institution involved had not reasonably relied, but it did not simply say, well, you should have known what the law is and, therefore, your reliance was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.422" offset="12314870">The Court thoroughly went through the four or five factors which demonstrated in that case that that institution had not reasonably relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.611" offset="12347576">It was a totality of circumstances type of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.230" offset="12362100">And I think that's the appropriate type of analysis that should be used whenever we're determining whether there was reasonable reliance on a misrepresentation by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.669" offset="12399821">I suggested earlier one problem of using the strict presumed to know rule would be that we could all be required to have lawyers every time we call up any government agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.958" offset="12440990">I think perhaps an even more important consequence of applying that strict rule would be to erode further the confidence in government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.297" offset="12478397">If every citizen knew that the legal fiction is that we are all presumed to know the law and that it's always unreasonable to rely on the government, then I think confidence in government would go down somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.538" offset="12523328">So I think this Court has indicated since the Merrill decision that reasonable reliance is determined based on the facts on the totality of circumstances and not merely on some maxim which no longer has any validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.531" offset="12579334">In this case there should be no doubt that Mr. Richmond did reasonably rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.519" offset="12603262">He went to his former employer, he went to the division of the Navy which had always handled his retirement, which had dealt with the issue in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.457" offset="12642968">He asked specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.409" offset="12650805">He asked them what... I've got this opportunity for short-term work, will it have any effect on my continued annuity?</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.015" offset="12681212">He asked specific questions and he received a specific written explanation in response to those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.752" offset="12708170">It was an unambiguous statement saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.686" offset="12715902">"You may earn over 80 percent for one year as long as you do not earn over 80 percent in the next year. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.192" offset="12741920">And he received that from the responsible Agency, from the Office of Personnel Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.477" offset="12763132">Again, I can only emphasize enough, this was not the statement of a low-level Navy employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.980" offset="12785075">This was the written explanation of the Navy... I... of the... of the Office of Personnel Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.134" offset="12805764">I think if you put all these factors together, there should not be much doubt that Mr. Richmond was reasonable in relying on the information which he was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.157" offset="12845783">Now, the other factor which has also in the past caused this Court not to reach the ultimate issue of whether there could be estoppel against the government is what is known as affirmative misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.352" offset="12906596">This Court has suggested that if there can be estoppel, there must also be affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.755" offset="12932196">And I think there's good logic in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.874" offset="12940660">There is some tension, as obviously this discussion has indicated, between sovereign immunity, separation of powers, and the concept of equitable estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.896" offset="12984755">And by adding this additional level that an individual must demonstrate, I think this Court has made it very clear that it's possible for that tension to be worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.304" offset="13026341">People who might be able to demonstrate just the traditional elements of estoppel will not necessarily be able to show affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.025" offset="13057270">But those who can show affirmative misconduct, will have demonstrated that they're entitled to estoppel against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.298" offset="13082348">Unfortunately, like many equitable terms, affirmative misconduct has not been clearly defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.867" offset="13112650">But I think that is the nature of equity in general and that is the nature of estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.105" offset="13133548">It's a balancing test to determine when you have affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.240" offset="13146087">At a minimum, as I suggested, it does require more than negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.925" offset="13160924">The lower courts are in pretty much agreement on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.440" offset="13458929">Mr. Richmond and others had retired before that, in 1981.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.948" offset="13505009">They needed information when the law changed to be able to conform their conduct in the future if they had an opportunity to gain more work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.339" offset="13550567">So, it's our position that OPM had a special obligation to these people to notify them that the law had changed and there was a very easy way for them to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.461" offset="13583063">The government in its reply brief in note 12 points out that every year the Office of Personnel Management sends out forms to all its disability annuitants asking for information on their prior year's earnings.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="3554.483" offset="14367155">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.102" offset="14373633">With respect factually to what OPM did, in our reply brief at pages 10 and 11, including footnote 11, we set forth in brief fashion what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.762" offset="14432252">OPM did, promptly after OBRA was passed in September of 1982, circulate information to the effect that the law had changed to the various civilian employers of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.140" offset="14497767">Those... that information was in fact received by the Department of the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.627" offset="14523680">OPM, for its part, no longer has responsibility or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.798" offset="14548340">This was a Navy problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.381" offset="14554714">So, just to clarify the record in terms of OPM.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.833" offset="14568506">Now, we've heard a lot about the OPM form and the information that... quote... OPM is giving out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.637" offset="14591703">OPM wasn't giving out this form, this was from the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.089" offset="14605496">Yet, Mr. Richmond knew full well he was ultimately dealing with OPM.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.707" offset="14623990">Every year he sent in to OPM on an OPM form a statement with respect to his eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.944" offset="14648964">If you look at the... if the Court looks at the Appendix, the document that has received so much attention today in the argument, the document on its face--</text>

            <text syncTime="3637.937" offset="14700895">--Attachment 4, page 1(a) of our opening brief, does not, to my reading of it, apply to Mr. Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.195" offset="14753976">He was given this form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.260" offset="14738198">We don't quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.345" offset="14746557">We don't contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.797" offset="14760350">But this form, on its face, doesn't apply to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.416" offset="14774874">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.951" offset="14780934">"Information to applicants for disability retirement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.451" offset="14790965">He was not that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.153" offset="14793786">He was already on disability retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.771" offset="14804235">The first sentence doesn't apply to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.354" offset="14810609">"Your agency's review of your employment record shows that you're eligible for regular... regular voluntary retirement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.508" offset="14835164">That's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.425" offset="14838926">He wasn't eligible for voluntary retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.893" offset="14848748">We're not quarreling with the fact that Mr. Richmond received information that was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.714" offset="14872049">But we do want to be clear that OPM, for its part, was in fact seeking in a responsible way to furnish information to the employing agency and agencies across the country with which the employees dealt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.159" offset="14937773">With respect to the law, we have heard essentially an assault on Merrill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.878" offset="14956686">Merrill is good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.230" offset="14966090">This Court has cited Merrill as recently as Heckler against Community Health Services, quoted extensively from it, and in Schweiker against Hansen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.120" offset="15009662">We continue to believe that this case is on practically... not entirely... all fours with Schweiker against Hansen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.524" offset="15039233">The principal distinction is this piece of paper that this individual, Mr. Richmond received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.428" offset="15062848">This Court has previously rejected estoppel claims where writings, including specifically tailored writings advising individuals or entities about their particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.522" offset="15111226">I cite United States v. Stewart, Justice Douglas' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.890" offset="15124706">I cite in addition, the Automobile Club case, and there are a variety of cases set forth in our brief where the government's erroneous information has been in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.495" offset="15167128">My final point is that Congress has identified the situations about which Mr. Richmond complains in a variety of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.387" offset="15206730">At page 24 of our brief we identify a goodly number of statutes in which Congress has taken the step to identify situations in which it intends good faith reliance on administrative rulings or advise and the like to constitute a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.663" offset="15275798">It also has provided, as we set forth in page 25, a number of statutes in which governmental recoupment of funds is not permitted if it would offend equity and good conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.072" offset="15325430">I thank the Court.</text>
