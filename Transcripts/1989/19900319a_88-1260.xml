            <text syncTime="11.039" offset="197919">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.661" offset="212443">Petitioner Citibank is here on writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.035" offset="225922">The outcome of this case will be of tremendous importance to the banking industry and to Federal regulators, but the case is not complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.800" offset="268972">What happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.962" offset="285586">Wells... the Respondent, Wells Fargo Asia Limited, made two deposits totalling $2 million, Eurodollars, in Citibank's Manila branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.531" offset="327904">Before the time came for repayment the Philippine government entered a decree that made it impossible for us to repay in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.438" offset="367506">Now, at that point Wells Fargo Asia sued Citibank in New York, saying that since the Manila branch could not pay, Citibank in New York had to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.974" offset="413690">We, of course, think the risk of what the Philippine government did was on the depositor in the foreign branch, in the Manila branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.382" offset="451306">Now, a panel of the Second Circuit stated that normally a deposit is repayable only at the branch where it is made, but in this case, because there were routing instructions, routine routing instructions for putting the money back through New York on the way to repayment, that they had somehow... the banks had somehow agreed to repay in New York--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="95.103" offset="534167">Well, they found... the Second Circuit found there was a contract to that effect, a contractual agreement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert__h_bork" startTime="99.737" stopTime="134.011">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="99.737" offset="552766">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.858" offset="553184">They found there was a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.460" offset="559662">And what that contract was, a routing instruction, it was a little odd because the routing instruction said that Citibank Manila would pay out of its bank account in Citibank... its bank account, not Citibank,... its bank account in Citibank, would repay Wells Fargo Asia's bank account with Wells Fargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.933" offset="641478">But simply because it went through New York the Second Circuit decided that it was payable in New York, and then shifted the person who had to pay from Citibank Manila to Citibank in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.011" offset="689857">Well, we don't usually review those very factual determinations, was there or was there not a contract to a particular effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.676" offset="716502">Well, I think in this case what is up for review is a question of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.511" offset="735832">It is our contention that that question of law, when they construed that as a contract, is preempted by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.545" offset="775956">And you will notice, Mr. Chief Justice, that nobody in this case defends the Second Circuit's rationale.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.050" offset="841994">As we have said in our brief and as the Solicitor General says, this is clearly not a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.546" offset="875953">Well, then you are just arguing about a very fact specific determination about the Second Circuit, it seems to me, if you agree that whatever view of Federal law one takes, the parties could change the result by agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.392" offset="923391">--Yes, but according to Federal law, Mr. Chief Justice, what I am saying is this cannot be a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.305" offset="943035">If it has been, then for 40 years the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have been interpreting these things wrong.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="205.891" offset="977308">Well, but if they can... if Citibank could have agreed to this liability by an express contract, you would know... you could protect yourself in every, every transaction after this by making sure that you didn't have such a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.293" offset="1102905">If this were correct, all Eurodollars, which are payable offshore only, suddenly hundreds of billions of dollars suddenly become payable in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.297" offset="1142924">Those are deposits offshore for which no reserves have been created, for which no insurance has been paid--</text>

            <text syncTime="343.990" offset="1529746">The Solicitor General says he finds our rule attractive... and by the way, I am not arguing primarily for a Federal common law rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.417" offset="1575408">But the Solicitor General says you don't have to reach that issue because the common law, correctly interpreted, would give us the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.675" offset="1608426">And he does stress that there in an enormous Federal interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.747" offset="1620756">If you look at page 12 of his brief, page 18 of his brief, and towards the end of the brief, he says if the common law doesn't come out right they will have to come back and begin discussing whether or not there is a Federal law that preempts, or that there is a common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.358" offset="1675195">The fact is his position rests upon a notion that the law is the same all over the world and in all states.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.100" offset="2958121">There is only one finding of fact in this case about what those routing instructions mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.084" offset="2982154">The district court found as a fact that was not an agreement making the deposits collectable in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.940" offset="3017576">The court of appeals did not find that clearly erroneous, it simply read the words of the telexes and said that's an agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.129" offset="3062297">And these are routine transactions, and I think as a matter of Federal law they cannot be taken as agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.896" offset="3093331">And in fact I think Federal law covers this entire field I have mentioned to you, Congress' delegation to the Federal Reserve Board to make all the regulations as to foreign banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.483" offset="3131679">The Federal Reserve Board did that in its most... its clearest statement of Federal law was in its 1970 bulletin opinion, which is to be found at page 87 of the appendix, and I will quote just three sentences from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.255" offset="3194791">It said said exemptions, that is, exemptions from... for foreign branches from reserve requirements and exemptions from interest rate limits, are intended principally to enable foreign branches of U.S. banks to compete on a more nearly equal basis with other banks in foreign countries in accordance with the laws and regulations of those countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.968" offset="3277651">Having given the policy of Federal interest, a Federal policy in having competitive foreign branches, in the very next sentence the opinion goes on to say, to lay out the law, a customer who makes a deposit that is payable solely at a foreign branch assumes whatever risk may exist that the foreign country might impose restrictions on withdrawals.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.812" offset="3368975">To make it still clearer, the very next sentence says when payment of a deposit in a foreign branch is guaranteed by a promise of payment at a banking office in the United States if not paid at the foreign office, the depositor no longer assumes such risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.639" offset="5276332">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.407" offset="5315411">The lower courts in this case adopted two general theories in support of the conclusion that a routine Eurodollar placed with a foreign branch of a United States bank is a general obligation to the bank as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.385" offset="5367342">The district court found that there had been no agreement between the parties as to where the deposit would be repaid, but concluded that as a matter of law that deposit obligation was an obligation of the bank as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.705" offset="5416557">The court of appeals disagreed with that statement of the rule of law, but found that in fact the routing instructions that the parties had agreed to for settlement of the deposit account in New York constituted an agreement to repay in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.104" offset="5474235">Let me briefly address why both of those are matter of deep concern to the Federal banking agencies and why we think in particular the court of appeals' judgment cannot stand as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.873" offset="5525226">It has long been understood by the banking community and by the Federal banking agencies that the relationship between a deposit agreement and instructions for settlement of a deposit through the New York clearinghouse bears roughly the same relationship as any type of contractual obligation pays to provisions for the clearance of a check that might be written in satisfaction of that contractual obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.332" offset="7851065">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.191" offset="7894533">At the outset I will provide an overview of the four central points that I would like to leave with you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.656" offset="7920446">First, the Philippine decree in question, MAAB 47, did not in any way prohibit repayment of these deposits, a finding of the district court which was affirmed broadly by the Second Circuit in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.165" offset="7978438">Second, Citibank's unconditional promise to repay is not limited to any particular assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.281" offset="8010934">Third, no Federal law or regulation limits Citibank's obligation to repay to any particular assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.226" offset="8042699">And fourth, and finally, policy considerations do not call for this Court now to create new Federal law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.283" offset="8078853">Let me then turn to my first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.043" offset="8089928">It is one that really hasn't been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.295" offset="8098915">It has been glossed over today; it was glossed over in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.247" offset="8110722">And I think it is so fundamental to an understanding of this case and to the contractual relationship of the parties and what the courts below did that we must deal with it at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.404" offset="8147398">The brief of the petitioner and the argument today proceeds upon the false assumption that some action taken by the Philippine Central Bank prevented repayment of these deposits by Citibank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.931" offset="8197448">And in fact that is exactly contrary to what both courts below held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.075" offset="8218033">So we must begin by analyzing what is it that the Philippine government did, and how did that action relate to either the assets of Citibank on the one hand, or the deposits of Wells Fargo on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.934" offset="8269546">If we look at the verbiage of MAAB 47 and the way it was construed and enforced by the Philippine Central Bank and the government, what we find, contrary to Petitioner's argument, is that it was only Citibank's assets in its Manila branch that were affected by the Philippine regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.788" offset="8352929">What the Philippine Central Bank said was because of certain economic instability in our country we are going to request that you obtain prior approval from us if you are going to reduce the overall level of your loan activities in the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.210" offset="8430565">It did not say, as in a Perez case or in a Garcia case or some of these other cases, we are going to seize the deposit, we are going to garnish the deposit of Wells Fargo, the debtor, the depositor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.770" offset="8476854">It did not take action that was directed at all at Wells Fargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.831" offset="8489080">Wells Fargo merely had two deposits for six months on deposit with Citibank at the time that this action occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.346" offset="8515202">The deposits were made in June of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.268" offset="8526800">The regulation was adopted in October of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.672" offset="8536413">In December these deposits matured, and Citibank at that time had no legal excuse for nonpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.306" offset="8567029">After Wells Fargo demanded payment at Manila and Citibank refused to pay, they then claimed that they had a defense of impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.432" offset="8603496">So it is important at the outset to understand that the--</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.524" offset="8779875">Let me point to two pieces of evidence that were found by the court below to answer that very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.388" offset="8803280">First of all, in the spring of 1984 Citibank made a limited request to the Philippine Central Bank requesting that it have permission to repay only to the extent of its non-Philippine assets that it held in its Manila branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.378" offset="8867333">And having postured the question that way, which I would submit was part of their litigation strategy, they got back an answer which said of course, you can repay these deposits to the extent of your non-Philippine assets at the Manila branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.528" offset="8923862">But here is the question they didn't ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.191" offset="8930549">They didn't ask can we have permission under this regulation to repay with our assets that are outside the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.627" offset="8960328">Because had they asked that question, they would have got an answer that they didn't like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.380" offset="8975271">And Justice Stevens, we didn't just sit back then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.531" offset="8983943">We asked ourself that question in December of 1984, and it's at page 95 of the Joint Appendix, the Philippine Central Bank sent a telex to Wells Fargo's counsel answering the very question, we have no objection, they said, to repayment of these deposits, as long as you do not in any way reduce the Philippine assets of Citibank at its Manila branch.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.903" offset="9221344">What the Philippine government was saying is with respect to the loans that you have made to Philippine borrowers, whether they be farmers or merchants, we do not want you to reduce, because we don't want an outflow of foreign currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.461" offset="9267633">We don't want you to reduce the overall level of those loans to Philippine borrowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.344" offset="9283097">You can call them in, you can collect them, you can pay them back, but you must maintain a level of overall funding in the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.360" offset="9311205">They did not in any way go further and say, in addition, to the extent that you pay off Wells Fargo, you are going to have to in addition to that fund other borrowers that were putting in U.S. dollar deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.740" offset="9356763">That was not part of the regulation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.390" offset="9363346">If you just look at what the Philippine Central Bank itself said it did, rather than the way Citibank characterizes it, it's clear in Joint Appendix 95, it is clear with the wording of the stand still agreement, which is Joint Appendix 118, and moreover it is clear that by the time that the Philippine Central Bank gave partial permission to repay, based on the request that was made, which is at Joint Appendix 89 to 91, that they had no objection whatsoever to Citibank repaying these deposits after--</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.815" offset="10729027">Well, this was not a demand deposit in the first place, but we could have made a demand there because, indeed, in the trial of this case, we submitted it to the trial court on the basis that Philippine law applied and that it was repayable in Manila upon the maturity of the deposits in six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.109" offset="10806245">And the court held that indeed at the end of six months appropriate steps had been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.433" offset="10835502">Wells Fargo had done what was necessary, and payment was to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.978" offset="10853684">Its payment was unexcused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.109" offset="10858177">There is no condition on the obligation here with respect to payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.102" offset="10878134">Let me then address the question of Federal law that Mr. Bork raised this morning, and I think Justice Scalia was driving at in his last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.099" offset="10914183">One of the questions that has now been raised for the first time by Petitioner at this Court and was not raised in the two lower courts is whether or not Reg. D and the 1970 Board interpretation can be construed to displace local law on this subject, which has been a set of dual regulation for the last 60 or 70 years, and has traditionally been the subject not of Federal law, but with respect to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.567" offset="11032048">We are not talking about the question of reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.459" offset="11043646">That has been a subject of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.011" offset="11049811">We are talking about the traditional relationship between a bank and its depositors.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="2727.513" offset="11063813">Of course at the time these regs were adopted, and these provisions that Mr. Bork was reading to us, there was no difference between Federal law and state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.401" offset="11103414">I mean, there was assumed to be a common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.504" offset="11111773">I mean, we are talking today as though at the time these things... this thing was set up and these regs were issued people were thinking well, it is the common law, but is it New York common law or is it Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.460" offset="11155659">In fact, this was before Erie, and we didn't think there was a difference, did we?</text>

            <label>Mr. Darryl Snider</label>
            <text syncTime="2754.525" offset="11171855">Not before Erie, but that was certainly the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.809" offset="11188991">I think it's really the 1970 Board interpretation that Mr. Bork read to you in part today that they rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.174" offset="11214487">That Board interpretation sets up a way of defining when reserves must be made with respect to foreign deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.159" offset="11250431">It does not in any way purport to regulate the subject of when a depositor can be repaid from a foreign branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.984" offset="11285749">It is not a rule about liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.476" offset="11291705">I think that the petitioner here has mixed up cause and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.979" offset="11305706">What the regulation says is that you look at the contractual relationship of the parties to assist you in determining whether or not reserves must be assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.466" offset="11343636">It doesn't say the converse of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.417" offset="11351473">It doesn't say you look at whether reserves were paid, and then from having looked at whether reserves were paid you come back and decide whether there is liability or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.942" offset="11377491">And I would submit to you that that is indeed why the U.S. government here in its brief and in its argument does not contend that local law has been displaced by Reg. D or by the 1970 Board interpretation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.479" offset="11419705">And in fact on this question we sought to clarify the matter with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.684" offset="11440498">And one of the pieces of evidence that was put in at the trial court and is before you in Joint Appendix 135 is an opinion letter of the board of governors for the Federal Reserve Board in April of 1987, after this case was tried... after this case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.266" offset="11502879">And that opinion letter distinguishes the concept of liability on the one hand and reserves on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.362" offset="11527225">It says that Reg. D and the 1970 Board interpretation regulate reserves but do not regulate the subject of liability as between a bank and its depositors, and goes on to say in fact nothing in Reg. D or the Board interpretation would prevent a bank from transferring assets from a U.S. office to a foreign office to effect a repayment in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.337" offset="11615101">And so, just as Justice Stevens was saying earlier this morning in his questioning, just like in the case of insolvency where the home office might well have to pay because the foreign branch office cannot pay, the same is true in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.208" offset="11678631">Now, that is not to say that Wells Fargo did not take any risk whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.290" offset="11690960">We are not here to say that we took no risk and therefore somehow Citibank should have paid reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.876" offset="11713321">That is not the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.477" offset="11715724">But the question is what is the risk that Wells Fargo took.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.310" offset="11730980">The risk it took was a Perez-type risk that the foreign government might actually take an action that was directed at it as an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.886" offset="11761282">After all, that is what Mr. Castro did in the Perez and Garcia cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.589" offset="11776120">He was taking a certain action to seize the deposits of certain political individuals that he wished to point out and to deprive of their assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.766" offset="11808825">That is a very minimal risk when you are talking about a banking institution in the inter-bank market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.450" offset="11831604">We did not take the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.799" offset="11836933">And I would submit that the expert of Citibank at the trial admitted that in this situation Wells Fargo did not take the risk that some other regulation might be adopted that interfered in some way with Citibank's assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.970" offset="11897641">It goes to the heart of the very question that is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.303" offset="11911016">And Mr. Ian Giddy, who is Citibank's own expert, on cross-examination gave the following testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.367" offset="11935257">"And the expectations of bankers, the practice, that is what I am trying to get to, is that they would be repaid by the home office, isn't it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.923" offset="11973501">"Answer, under the circumstances where the branch had its assets restricted or seized, and that was a poor loan decision by the bank and it is their risk, they are still liable for the deposits. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.680" offset="12544537">Because if it is payable in New York and the parties agree that it is payable in New York, then Citibank certainly has assets there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.227" offset="13014637">The testimony was given by Mr. Boughey, the testimony was given by Mr. Cole, who were called by Wells Fargo, and indeed the testimony was given by Mr. Howard, the chief financial officer of Citibank, that in addition to these routing instructions the parties expected and agreed that repayment would occur in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.421" offset="13083496">And after all, we have got to realize that in the Eurodollar market we are dealing with dollars in which these transactions not only clear in New York, but there is a specific agreement embodied in the very nature of the Eurodollar transaction that the parties are agreeing that the bank, the institution, stands behind these deposits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.530" offset="13375858">Let me come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.492" offset="13379724">What we have had since 1983, since Citibank defaulted in this case, is a situation in the world market, and much of this is discussed in the amicus brief of the Bank of Montreal, a situation in which banks now will only place money in secure money centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.593" offset="13444195">There are no longer inter-bank deposits in Manila, no longer inter bank deposits in Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.446" offset="13463525">They are either in London or in Frankfurt or the Cayman Islands, in a secure location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.230" offset="13490693">And the reason for that is because no one in 1983 assumed that the depositors were taking this kind of sovereign risk, and that is what the trial was all about, after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.077" offset="13530085">We moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.030" offset="13537922">The... Citibank came in and said we will prove a custom and practice that indeed depositors in the marketplace will not be repaid whenever there is any interference whatsoever with our assets or any repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.968" offset="13589644">And the trial was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.118" offset="13598213">They had their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.380" offset="13603333">The witnesses were called.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.722" offset="13608662">And indeed the court found that there was no such custom and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.385" offset="13623290">And one of the key points that the district court relied upon is at the very time that these deposits were made, in June of 1983, Citibank was offering a 10 percent interest rate in Frankfurt, London, Singapore and Manila, and yet everyone knew that in terms of political economic instability, the Philippines were a riskier location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.699" offset="13704583">And yet the interest rates were identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.371" offset="13711271">Well, based on what you say, then, the Federal Reserve assumes that deposits are safer in France than they are in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.178" offset="13754529">I think that the only purpose now for the Federal Reserve regulation of reserves is no longer a concept that we have to have a certain amount of money set aside in case there is some kind of a run on the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.367" offset="13799251">I think that was one of the original purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.669" offset="13804475">As the 1980 amendments to the act provide, the only remaining purpose for the Federal Reserve regulation of reserves is monetary policy, the implementation of monetary policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.701" offset="13876573">Let me try one more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.893" offset="13881380">The Federal Reserve understanding is that because they did not want... they wanted U.S. banks on the one hand to be able to compete in the Eurodollar market, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.690" offset="13928505">To do that they had to make offshore deposits free from reserves and free from FDIC assessments, so that U.S. banks could be competitive and could offer the same kind of interest rates that banks abroad are offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.870" offset="13981272">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.320" offset="13983048">Having set up that exemption from reserves, they then were concerned about a situation like Garcia, and this whole interpretation came up because of a Garcia situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.850" offset="14029128">That's where the depositor not only made the deposit at the offshore branch, it simultaneously exacted a promise out of the bank saying but if anything happens to interfere with repayment, I've got a guarantee that I will be repaid in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.357" offset="14083150">And the Federal government and the Board interpretation is saying no, you can't do that.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3485.980" offset="14097674">I... if the... if the Federal Reserve Board had been asked how this case should come out you would say they would have said just like the Second Circuit did?</text>

            <label>Mr. Darryl Snider</label>
            <text syncTime="3496.969" offset="14141664">I believe they would say that, except for their objection here through the Solicitor General to the reliance upon routing instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.303" offset="14171026">But I believe that they would agree that, in the absence of a Garcia guarantee, that the normal rule of Sokoloff applies, that when only the assets of the bank are interfered with or regulated by the foreign government and there is no action to take on the deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.903" offset="14233406">In fact, the very language of the C.F.R. regulation that they rely on, 204.128, is when there is imposition of a restriction on a withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.090" offset="14270082">And I ask you, has there been an imposition of a restriction on Wells Fargo's deposit with respect to withdrawal?</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.045" offset="14297981">Both courts below have answered that question no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.487" offset="14307698">The only action taken in the Philippines was to restrict Citibank's assets to require them to continue to invest in the Philippines until the Philippines could restructure its debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.285" offset="14350957">It had no objection, as it said in the telex, to repayment of these deposits with dollars in New York in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.118" offset="14378229">Let me just finish, since I have a limited amount of time left, with some policy considerations that I think are important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.234" offset="14402680">This market is one in which only two of the top 50 banks in the world are from this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.666" offset="14428488">This market is one in which, while there are billions of dollars of transactions taking place every day, they take place under terms and understandings that have been agreed to and agreed upon by bankers around the world, and the subject matter that we are talking about is one that is not appropriate, in my view, to regulation by a court through enforcement or interpretation of a regulation like Reg. D.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.392" offset="14523365">This is a matter that should be discussed... if we are going to change the rules, because all Wells Fargo contends is that the status quo should be maintained, but if Citibank wants to change the rules, it is a more appropriate subject either for private negotiation--</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.864" offset="14637259">No one else in the world had this understanding except Citibank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.726" offset="14648648">And the court below said you know, it would have been a dead cinch, you had this view, you knew that nobody else was taking the view that they were taking the sovereign risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.381" offset="14683339">It would have been so easy for you either by way of contract, by putting a legend on your confirmation slips, by sending out a letter or some other means communicating to all these depositors that you had this unique view that everyone else was taking the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.990" offset="14741749">And in fact I don't even believe Citibank had the view until after they defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.992" offset="14753765">Because what did they do right after they defaulted?</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.754" offset="14760766">They sent a letter to us and to the other depositors and said now that you are assuming the sovereign risk we will pay you 1-1/8 percent interest over LIBOR, which is the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.050" offset="14801935">They didn't do that before, they just paid us the 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.834" offset="14813115">And both experts said we didn't pay any sovereign risk premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.345" offset="14827117">And as soon as this situation happened the, Citibank went out and it offered a point and an eighth over LIBOR.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.510" offset="14855852">Those offers by Citibank are found in the Joint Appendix 115 with respect to Wells Fargo, 116 for Marine Midland, and 399 for the Bank of Montreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.117" offset="14890229">So, Citibank, having come to its own unique view of the world, then attempted essentially to shift this loss to all of its depositors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.863" offset="14929204">What it is asking this Court to do is to give it something that it couldn't accomplish in private arms' length negotiation, that it couldn't accomplish through the application of local law.</text>
