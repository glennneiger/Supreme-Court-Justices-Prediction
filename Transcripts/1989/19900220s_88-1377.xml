            <text syncTime="8.052" offset="119304">This case is here from the Third Circuit, concerns supplemental security income benefits for children.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.874" offset="154517">The Social Security Act authorizes this for a child who suffers from an impairment of “comparable severity” to one that would render an adult disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.790" offset="210210">An adult is disabled if he is prevented from engaging in any substantial gainful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.207" offset="239885">The Secretary of Health and Human Services has created a five-step test to determine adult disability that the third step, a claimant may be found to be disabled if medical evidence matches or is equal to anyone of at number of listed impairments.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.409" offset="316685">If this does not work for the adult claimant, he still may qualify at the fourth and fifth steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.459" offset="344897">In contrast, the Secretary’s test for a child claimant ends with what he equates to the adult’s third step.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.783" offset="378230">The respondent child here was denied benefits and brought a class action challenging the child disability regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.388" offset="408636">The District Court granted summary judgment for the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.333" offset="424414">The Court of Appeals vacated that judgment for it found the regulatory scheme inconsistent with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.389" offset="452626">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we agree that the child disability regulations are inconsistent with the statutory statement of comparable severity and we affirm the Court of Appeals judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.124" offset="507588">Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by the Chief Justice.</text>
