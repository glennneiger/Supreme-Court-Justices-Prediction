            <text syncTime="15.122" offset="148283">In an opinion filed today, we hold that California’s imposition of sales and use tax liability on a religious organization’s sale of religious materials does not contravene the religion clauses of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.663" offset="218500">The collection on payment of a generally applicable sales and use tax does not violate the Free Exercise Clause because such a tax imposes no constitutionally significant burden on an adherence religious practices or beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.574" offset="290180">Neither does such a tax violate the Establishment Clause because a state does not foster excessive entanglement with religion simply by imposing these generally applicable administrative and record-keeping duties on religious organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.443" offset="361651">Because the issue is not decided below, we do not reach the claims that imposition of the tax on certain mail order sales violates the Commerce and Due Process Clauses.</text>
