            <text syncTime="1468.961" offset="6015872">So this is simply giving the defendant the remedy to deal with an issue that he is now powerless to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.840" offset="6063415">In the Lockhart case, the Court assumed that the defendant was able to point to a particular group, that the particular group had certain immutable characteristics of race, of gender, of ethnic background.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.879" offset="6623584">Well, the impact on the defendant of a violation of the Equal Protection Clause would be a Sixth Amendment violation because he has an interest in his jury serving as the conscience of the community which is denied if the fair possibility of the cross-section is frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.923" offset="6699757">And the equal protection argument would concentrate on the interests of the juror, which being of the same race, he had the authority to... to contend or to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.551" offset="6750226">So, this is a broader issue because there are broader interests at stake of a defendant to have his jury chosen and serve in a fair system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.571" offset="6802366">So, because of the emphasis that this Court has put on the process of choosing the jurors, that this Court must have equal concern with the process of choosing the petit jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.332" offset="6857328">That if this Court means to make meaningful its emphasis on the fair selection process, it must do as well on the petit jury because that's the only jury that counts as far as the defendant is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.373" offset="6913544">So we do ask your Honors then to recognize the right whenever a defendant, whatever his race, demonstrates that members of the black community are being removed on grounds of their membership on the false assumption that because they're black they're unqualified to serve in a case, that he be able to make an objection, attain a hearing, and prevail on his grounds.</text>

            <label>Ms. Inge Fryklund</label>
            <text syncTime="1729.289" offset="7057217">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented today is whether the Sixth Amendment regulates the use of peremptory challenges during voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.120" offset="7136525">Our position is that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.623" offset="7146556">The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to trial by jury, which as this Court has said in numerous decisions, the fundamental purpose of trial by jury is to prevent oppression by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.492" offset="7193994">And, furthermore, we're guaranteed not only this trial by jury, but trial specifically by an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.218" offset="7216877">So, I believe the focus of the Sixth Amendment is on this end result of an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.972" offset="7239970">Counsel suggested in the course of his argument today that the outcome of the composition of the jury is somehow less important than the process and that this Court should be focusing primarily on process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.142" offset="7300574">I think that that is absolutely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.521" offset="7314157">We must always be looking at the touchstone of the Sixth Amendment, which is the impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.476" offset="7333906">The Sixth Amendment purposes of achieving an impartial jury are achieved in practice by a sequence of stages that begins with the broadly-based jury pool which must be drawn from a cross-section of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.377" offset="7401511">And the process ends sometime later in an individual courtroom in which a prosecutor and an individual defendant and his attorney... two adversaries... are mutually engaged in the process of picking an impartial jury of six, or, as in Illinois, 12 jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.690" offset="7478833">And the choices at all stages of the process are, of course, constrained by the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.914" offset="7503702">Now, the broad... we believe that the very broad mix of all the distinctive groups on the jury pool is directly and casually related to the overriding purpose of preventing oppression by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.668" offset="7570680">Given that it's the government which by definition is a party to every criminal case, which is solely in control of all the mechanisms of jury summoning and recruitment, it is vital that the government not be able to manipulate or gerrymander the jury pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.849" offset="7643405">Thus, at the time the government is making its decision to indict, which usually comes some weeks or even months ahead of the actual trial date, the government is constrained in making its charging decision by the knowledge that it has no control over who is going to be able to appear on the venire, and potentially any member of the community could appear to try the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.884" offset="7735565">I think this is why even if the particular defendant ultimately opts for a bench trial this broadly-based jury pool has served a very vital function for keeping the government honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.452" offset="7789899">As Justice Scalia pointed out earlier, if the jury pool is broadly-based with nobody in particular eliminated, at the time the two parties reach the final stage of voir dire, they're both on a level playing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.753" offset="7851026">Neither has been able to bias the direction of the venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.847" offset="7867431">Then, when the trial date for an individual case arrives and the two individual parties enter the courtroom, the government is no longer in control of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.114" offset="7916541">The government has switched hats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.764" offset="7923124">Now the government is one party in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.857" offset="7943499">And at this stage the judge exercises... or, removes jurors for cause, and the two parties... and in Illinois the two parties have the same number of peremptory challenges, it's now seven... the two parties jointly act to pick a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.501" offset="8018001">And they do this by each side acts to remove the individual people whom it suspects are going to be least favorable to consideration of its own side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.170" offset="8064708">It is our position that at this stage, in the midst of voir dire, that the demographic composition of the jury which is ultimately chosen, or the composition of the array of people who have been excused, is absolutely irrelevant to any purpose which is protected by the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.574" offset="8154360">Therefore, whether petitioner is talking about having a quota of some representatives of the community on his petit jury or, as he spoke in his brief, about a fair possibility that some particular distribution would obtain, or whether, as he emphasized in argument today, that we have to look to someone's motivation for particular choices... however it is he phrases, we believe that under the Sixth Amendment his claim fails at the very threshold because the group membership of individual impartial people is absolutely irrelevant to anything and should not be the basis for a cognizable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.273" offset="8337113">In fact, since this goal of impartiality is logically independent of the race, socioeconomic class, ethnic origin, or any other personal characteristic of the individual jurors, any sort of rule of selection or any prohibition on what the government can do in selection that's based on anything other than impartiality is bound to go counter to the expressed values of the Sixth Amendment which is the goal of impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.887" offset="8467620">So, our position is the only time at which a defendant is entitled to a fair cross-section of the community is the point at which the names go into the box for selecting the venires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.891" offset="8515581">That's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.154" offset="8520701">Now, coming back to this overriding purpose of achieving impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.178" offset="8552779">Petitioner Holland here has never contended that there was anything wrong about the way the Cook County jury pool was selected, and he has never contended that there was anything impartial about the jury of 12 that actually convicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.919" offset="8607741">In fact, in this case, given that he had five peremptory challenges left over at the time his jury was sworn, we know with certainty that he was perfectly satisfied with the impartiality of his jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.647" offset="8654657">What he is telling us now is that he wants not just impartiality, but impartiality plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.390" offset="8681615">Now, plus race, ethnic origin, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.493" offset="8706066">And I submit that there is nothing in the Sixth Amendment that entitles him to impartiality--</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.308" offset="8893312">But, as Justice White's questions earlier pointed out, logically if this can apply in a civil case in which both sides are private citizens, that same rationale should certainly apply to the defendant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.367" offset="8949527">In fact, it would be rather strange to have a procedure which constrained the government in a way which was on some basis other than impartiality and yet did not in a comparable way constrain the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.158" offset="9012639">Almost by definition we would end up with something which was less impartial than before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2386.918" offset="9687748">He was the same race as the excluded jurors, which is a fairly traditional basis for third party standing... that he is not only similar and can stand in the shoes of the excluded jurors, but he also suffers, I think, some injury in fact to himself as he, a black defendant, is standing there watching members of his race being shown the door.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.296" offset="10685207">So, the Equal Protection Clause is dealing with something other than impartiality.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.212" offset="10968897">At the level of the jury pool, we know that by definition there is a fair possibility if in fact no distinctive group has been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.680" offset="11010797">And we test that by looking over some period of time to see if the composition of the jury pools matches the composition of the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.605" offset="11106510">That, over a period of six months, looking to see if the jurors who actually serve somehow match the demographic distribution in the county... that is something that would be possible to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.877" offset="11163561">In effect, that's recreating the Swain rule, but under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.881" offset="11179548">But it does have the advantage of the certain logic that it's a way of testing what he says he's looking for.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.755" offset="11331059">There is... there is no theoretical content to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.707" offset="11342866">Cook County, which is approximately 26 percent black on the voter lists... this should mean that in a Cook County jury the ideal would be three black people on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.906" offset="11391663">And suppose in a particular voir dire the state excused two blacks, as in this case, and impanelled two, how would we ever know which of those two choices was wrongful?</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.994" offset="11444012">What would the the trial judge do in order to manage voir dire?</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.837" offset="11459372">So, anything which does not require actual impaling of a full cross-section on the petit jury is left in complete limbo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.808" offset="11527290">The prosecutor can go home every night wondering if he has violated the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.772" offset="11551114">An additional problem with the analysis that petitioner is suggesting here is that I assume that this would be in effect at the same time the Batson rule is in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.882" offset="11611614">Batson can be claimed by a black defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.526" offset="11630108">The Sixth Amendment claim must be one which could be claimed by anybody, and I can foresee a lot of times when there would be a tension between what the Equal Protection Clause, as effectuated by the Batson rule, requires, and what a Sixth Amendment rule would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.909" offset="11703669">For example, in this case it would be possible for the trial judge to conclude, even if this was a black defendant here, that there was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause, that there were some race-neutral reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.839" offset="11759362">But, at the same time, this petition kept urging back in 1981 at the time of his trial that these were the... quote... "only two available black people".</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.436" offset="13605801">I believe the right of the defendant, or the expectation of the defendant has been well-expressed during respondent's argument, but this Court must assure that whatever the luck of the draw, the defendant has the right to a fair process which permits the fair cross-section as much as humanly and legally possible to reach the issue... to reach the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.025" offset="13724188">This Court has never focused merely on the end result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.658" offset="13738713">It has looked to the process involved because that's valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.801" offset="13751251">This Court has never merely assumed the Sixth Amendment is satisfied by an impartial jury or a fair trial because that doesn't assure that there's a fair system involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.640" offset="13794615">All we're asking is a system that, as with blacks, allows white defendants to complain of the arbitrary exclusion of blacks on grounds of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.137" offset="13840590">It's a very simple system, it's been used in Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.547" offset="13854278">The courts are familiar with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.239" offset="13860966">It can be used throughout the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.631" offset="13870579">And, in fact, if there is both a black defendant and a white defendant, it solves the nagging question of how the prosecutors can proceed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.047" offset="13908195">So, it does permit the... the last possibility of any prosecutor being in control of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.145" offset="13948633">And the state seems to think that as long as all the members of the community are placed at the outset, then the government is no longer in control of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.751" offset="13979039">In fact, they do remain in control over the system because they have that unconstitutional peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.557" offset="14002236">That wild card that they can use to totally frustrate the rights of the defendant which he has standing to object to under the Sixth Amendment, and the will of this court that the processes assure the fair possibility that the cross-section will reach the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.508" offset="14066079">Many of the concerns of the state that they admit today exist in trials of black defendants.</text>
