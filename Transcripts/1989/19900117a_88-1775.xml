            <text syncTime="869.931" offset="3627508">Let me... let me point out that the three ways in which Illinois claims that Petitioner's speech could be misleading are not self-evident and they are not based on any empirical evidence, any study, or any expert opinion that that speech would be misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.446" offset="3721549">Illinois first suggests that a statement of certification will imply that the state itself has certified or has endorsed the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.540" offset="3773898">But as the FTC will argue, it is implausible to believe that consumers will think certification by the National Board of Trial Advocacy is certification by the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.780" offset="3822904">Furthermore, even if there were evidence that Petitioner's statement was potentially misleading in that way, there are many simple regulatory measures to cure that misleading statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.588" offset="3874104">First is a simple requirement for a disclaimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.706" offset="3886538">Illinois could require attorneys to say on their letterheads that certification does not mean or imply certification or approval by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.431" offset="3929484">Second, there could be ad hoc approval of certifying organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.216" offset="3944635">Third, there could be approval of certifying organizations pursuant to preexisting standards and criteria that Illinois would find to be meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.656" offset="3978385">Fourth, there could be case-by-case review of all such statements, as this Court found would be a reasonable regulatory burden in Zauderer and in Shapero.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.844" offset="4019136">And finally, the states themselves could engage in certification of attorneys, as 11 states have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.367" offset="4049229">Under NBTA requirements, if a state provides itself for certification of attorneys, NBTA will not certify an attorney until the attorney has first been certified by that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.675" offset="4102414">In all these ways the entirely speculative fears of Illinois could be cured through reasonable regulatory measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.114" offset="4140240">With respect to the burden point that you raised, Justice Rehnquist, let me simply say that in Zauderer the Court said, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.754" offset="4178796">"Our recent decisions involving commercial speech have been grounded in the faith that the free flow of commercial information is valuable enough to justify imposing on would-be regulators the costs of distinguishing the truthful from the false, the helpful from the misleading and the harmless from the harmful.

            <text syncTime="1109.470" offset="4585575">On behalf of the Federal Trade Commission I'd like to make two submissions this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.572" offset="4601980">First, that Mr. Peel's certification claim, and other claims like it, are valuable commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.427" offset="4629461">And second, that certification claims cannot be entirely prohibited by the state on the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.783" offset="4666868">First, information about lawyer certification is valuable commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.318" offset="4685049">The First Amendment protects commercial speech on the theory that it performs a valuable function in allocating resources in a free-market economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.841" offset="4715142">Among other things, such information helps consumers pick out desirable goods and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.578" offset="4738026">The First Amendment theory, as applied to this case, would indicate that information about lawyer certification would help consumers pick out lawyers who are particularly competent to handle their particular problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.706" offset="4806571">Well, if a consumer had a problem that involved litigation, they could look for someone who is certified as a civil trial specialist by the National Board of Trial Advocacy, in comparison to another practitioner who didn't have any certification or also didn't, through looking at Martindale-Hubbell or something else... didn't have any indication that he had courtroom experience for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.905" offset="4907404">A lay person certainly isn't going to know that NBTA certification means all the specific things that are required to get the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.527" offset="4941885">He's not going to know that it requires 15 trials, five jury trials or a minimum of 45 days trial experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.264" offset="4968844">At the same time, the vast majority of people in this courtroom probably wouldn't know what tests a product had to go through to get an Underwriter's Laboratory certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.537" offset="5005833">He or she will know, however, that the certification implies that the attorney has passed some tests, some tests with bite, that are related to the subject area of the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.047" offset="5055884">And that's... that's the sort of implied claim that a certification statement makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.915" offset="5075423">And in that case it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.851" offset="5083156">I detected in the questions posed to previous counsel some limits as to what... or some questions as to what is left for the states if you recognize the ability of an attorney to say that I'm a certified civil trial specialist, or any other certification claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.312" offset="5148984">And in the Federal Trade Commission's view, substantial leeway is left within a wide zone of reasonableness for states to continue regulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.566" offset="5182003">Within the certification area, for example, if the organization had a musical chairs requirement or just had the requirement that one pay a certain fee, a state could of course prohibit that in their entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.874" offset="5227247">The reason... the theory would be that those claims do not... or that the requirements of the certification organization have no relationship at all to the implied claim the consumer would read from the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.866" offset="5279178">In addition, depending on what the state reasonably finds the reasonable consumer to understand the claim to be, the state could prohibit claims by certification organizations with insufficient requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.841" offset="5331110">For example, in this case if the State of Illinois had found that a reasonable consumer assumes that a civil trial specialist has at least tried one case, they could forbid organizations from... or forbid people from making claims that they are certified as a civil trial specialist by an organization that didn't have those particular requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.620" offset="5930254">As the study cited on page 2 of our brief in this case indicate, more than 90 percent of the people who suffered serious property damage, employment discrimination or had problems with their landlords, don't go see a lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.267" offset="14456831">In response to questions from Justice O'Connor and Justice White, the state acknowledged that Illinois does not have a blanket rule which prohibits attorneys from saying they concentrate their practice in civil trials, even though there is no objective standard in Illinois for what concentrate means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.728" offset="14530600">Instead, Illinois reviews those claims under a different rule, Rule 2101, which prohibits any misleading claim on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.434" offset="14565500">That is exactly the rule we are arguing for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.903" offset="14579397">There is no more justification for a blanket ban on this statement than there is for a blanket ban on statements that Illinois... in Illinois that attorneys concentrate their practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.011" offset="14619730">To the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.094" offset="14624119">Concentrate means something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.713" offset="14630597">In NBTA certification it means the attorney has spent at least 30 percent of his time in the previous five years in civil trials.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.401" offset="14669363">Mr. Ennis, I've been thinking about your assertion that the source of confusion said to exist by the Illinois Supreme Court is that they think that certified means certified by Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.459" offset="14717533">I don't think that's what the court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.059" offset="14724011">I think all the court said is when you say certified by the NBTA the average person would think that that is a permission to practice, that the NBTA is somehow an official organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.504" offset="14789735">The Supreme Court doesn't say that they'll think that constitutes Illinois approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.873" offset="14807185">But when you say NBTA&gt; ["] and then under that</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.658" offset="14822336">"licensed by the State of Illinois. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.210" offset="14832576">I think the... the... the unsophisticated person reading that might well think that... that indeed the more important thing is that you're certified by NBTA, which is, for all they know, some official organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.185" offset="14884507">Why isn't that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.201" offset="14888582">--First, Your Honor, that speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.786" offset="14894852">There is no evidence in this record that there is that potential for deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.904" offset="14911361">Even if there were such evidence, that also could be cured by a simple requirement of a disclaimer statement or by the other regulatory measures we have addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.510" offset="14949813">So, as in Zauderer, because the potentially misleading statement can be cured through regulation, a prophylactic ban is impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.883" offset="14987221">Justice Kennedy raised a question about expertise.</text>
