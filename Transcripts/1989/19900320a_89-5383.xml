            <text syncTime="20.145" offset="226813">Mark Howlett brought an action under Title 42, Section 1983, the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1873.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.440" offset="299955">The defendants were the School Board of Pinellas County, Florida and designated officials of that school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.549" offset="360351">The action charged two offenses: a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the due process clause and a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.126" offset="422731">The allegation with respect to the Fourth Amendment was that the assistant principal of the high school at which Mark Howlett was a student broke into his automobile while the automobile was lawfully parked on the school ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.003" offset="490231">The second charge of... of violation of due process was that in the ensuing suspension, which he received for five days, the due process, as ordained by this Court, was not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.953" offset="581973">The Circuit Court of Pinellas County, Florida is a court of general jurisdiction in which this action was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.642" offset="616769">The Circuit Court of Pinellas County dismissed the action on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.177" offset="638920">The first ground was that the sovereign immunity of the state of Florida barred the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.097" offset="662535">The second ground was that the administrative remedies had not been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.817" offset="685418">On appeal, the District Court of Appeals of the Second District of Florida affirmed on the first ground and did not reach the second ground, the first ground being that there was a want of jurisdiction because of the sovereign immunity of the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.148" offset="758770">Under Florida law, the school board is immune from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.267" offset="779250">The question presented, therefore, is whether or not the school board is immune under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.622" offset="816658">The Supreme Court of Florida, with one justice dissenting, denied review, and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.763" offset="853229">The first question to be addressed is simply the fact that the broad ground on which the District Court of Appeal of Florida affirmed the dismissal is, as a matter of law, incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.927" offset="1865944">One other point I'd like to make, Your Honor, in connection with that, is that in Owen against the City of Independence this Court established the rule that there is no discretion to violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.357" offset="1947655">And so anticipating the argument in the... which we have received in the brief from the opposition, one of the arguments is that the discretionary... the discretionary exception to the waiver covers this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.683" offset="2004915">We maintain that it does not because of this Court's position in Owen, simply that it's not constitutionally permissible to violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.741" offset="2049115">Therefore, there cannot be any discretion in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.110" offset="2062594">Consequently, the general waiver also has to include this class of cases unless there is going to be a discrimination against Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.667" offset="2108883">Another case illustrating the same point is Mondou against New York, a 1912 case, under the Federal Employees Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.475" offset="2152142">There the state of New York refused to enforce the FELA simply because it was contrary to the policy of the state of New York.</text>

St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, a 1984 decision written by Justice Brandeis, the operative provisions of the law there... of the law of Alabama there were that a proceeding which existed under the common law or under statute law could be brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.860" offset="2365614">But the FELA could not be brought because it was under Federal law and the express language of the Alabama statute did not include a claim based on Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.251" offset="2419218">In reversing the case, Justice Brandeis said that the question of jurisdiction, although originally a matter of state concern, is ultimately a question of Federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.344" offset="2471567">And if the only reason the similar claim is not enforced is simply because it is a claim based on Federal law, that distinction cannot be observed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.659" offset="6960867">Before the state courts, he argued simply that the Florida law of sovereign immunity was irrelevant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.997" offset="6990228">He, therefore, did not argue discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.932" offset="6997960">He did not even argue, for that matter, that the waiver was broad enough to permit his claim to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.252" offset="7019172">And the district court of appeal therefore explicitly said it was not addressing the scope of the waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.428" offset="7079880">Beyond that, the district court of appeal clearly decided this case on the understanding that analogous claims, claims analogous to Petitioner's based on state law, would be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.218" offset="7123035">The court said explicitly that Petitioner was asking the state court to... the state to open its courts to Federal claims that the state does not otherwise recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.157" offset="7154800">And in this very case, Petitioner asserted claims based on the Florida constitution, along with his 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.710" offset="7181027">Both sets of those claims were dismissed which seemed to me fairly persuasive evidence that the Florida courts do not discriminate against claims based on whether they are state or Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.685" offset="7220942">Beyond that, if the court were to look beyond the decision below to Florida law more broadly, it would find, I think, that Florida's waiver is not discriminatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.970" offset="7342045">It seems to me that that is a clear conclusion on the part of the district court of appeal that there is no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.774" offset="7365347">I think that conclusion by the state court about the meaning of its state law should be dispositive here in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.428" offset="7391887">If there is any doubt on the point... I mean, the briefs cite an enormous number of opinions from the Florida courts dismissing actions brought against the state or its political subdivisions involving circumstances quite similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.122" offset="7446640">I mean, if the court has doubt about the scope of Florida law, I think the solution would be to send the decision back to the Florida courts to determine whether discrimination exists, if the court thinks that that's a dispositive factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.496" offset="7492197">But, again, I think that the decision below rests... gives the Court ample ground to conclude that Florida courts do not view discrimination to exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.307" offset="8071384">Both were... were dismissed, which, again, seem to me fairly persuasive evidence that this type of claim is not cognizable when based on state law in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.246" offset="8111195">Again, that was clearly the view of the state court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.698" offset="8124987">And I think that you should be held to be dispositive of the meaning of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.053" offset="8154453">This sort of evenhanded, nondiscriminatory application of the jurisdictional rule is the sort of thing that the Court has dealt with before, and I think it's the sort of thing that the Court has indicated clearly is not a violation of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.563" offset="8212445">The Court has addressed in a variety of settings similar to this the obligations that the supremacy clause imposes on state courts to enforce Federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.669" offset="8252883">And it has routinely made clear that jurisdictional bars in the state... in the laws of the states to consideration of Federal actions are valid to permit state courts to dismiss those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.161" offset="8302829">The Court has said repeatedly, for example, most recently in its decision this term in Tafflin v. Levitt, that state courts may entertain Federal actions when they have jurisdiction to do so under their state law and when Congress hasn't vested exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.902" offset="8361761">The Court has indicated several times in the cases that petitioner cites in Testa and McKnett and Mondou that state courts must entertain Federal actions if they have jurisdiction to do so under their state law, and if they entertain analogous state law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.947" offset="8429993">And at the same time, the Court has held repeatedly in cases like Douglas and Mayfield and Herb v. Pitcairn that states are not obligated to disregard evenhanded limitations on their jurisdiction simply because a claim that's presented to them is Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.556" offset="8492373">The Douglas case presents a good example of this principle in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.277" offset="8507315">It was a suit brought in state court under a Federal statute, the Federal Employers Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.413" offset="8527900">It was brought by a foreign... by a nonresident plaintiff against a foreign corporation defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.384" offset="8551724">It was dismissed by the state court applying a state rule that gave its courts discretion to refuse jurisdiction over actions by foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.859" offset="8589653">This Court upheld that rule as a valid excuse for the denial of jurisdiction, even though it precluded the state court from hearing a Federal action that had been created by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2294.044" offset="9322336">I think that the analysis that the Court has used in cases like this... and let me set out a range of cases which are I think are... are instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.132" offset="9346682">In cases like Felder and Martinez, which Petitioner relies upon, where Federal courts entertained actions under 1983, under any Federal statute, issue in that case is the meaning of the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.590" offset="9400599">The elements of the cause of action, the defenses to the statute, are Federal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.327" offset="9419511">And Felder is a good example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.612" offset="9428602">The procedural rule there was essentially an exhaustion of remedies requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.730" offset="9441141">The Court said Congress addressed that in 1983 and excluded exhaustion as a element of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.151" offset="9470816">Therefore, the state's requirement in that action, its attempt to modify the 1983 action, is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.555" offset="9496416">The question in a case like that is one of congressional intent, as in any preemption analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.773" offset="9517314">I think that this case, a jurisdictional... a classic jurisdictional case presents a very different sort of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.879" offset="9549706">A cause of action is not typically understood to preempt a limitation on the jurisdiction of courts or to conflict with the limitation on the jurisdiction of courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.968" offset="9578022">And I think, again, cases like Douglas and Mayfield and Herb against Pitcairn show that in this setting, where there are state jurisdictional limitations and a Federal action, the action typically takes the state courts as it finds them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.209" offset="9635074">Now, the case that you hypothesize is sort of a middle case between those two sets of principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.548" offset="9660360">It's a... it's a case where the state entertains the 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.266" offset="9675302">And it entertains analogous state law actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.552" offset="9688364">And I think the question of whether Congress would have wanted to preempt the limitation that you describe, even though it's... it's made by the court... by the state in jurisdictional terms, would be a more difficult question than the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.025" offset="9742280">Now, my... my answer would be Congress should not be deemed to have wanted to override jurisdictional limitations of that sort, and however the court wants to cabin the jurisdiction of its courts, that should be dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.185" offset="9794943">But again, that is a closer question than this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.304" offset="9803407">There is no question that this sort of sovereign immunity limitation has always been regarded as jurisdictional, prior to the ratification of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.155" offset="11586839">So that... I mean, there is no question here, again, of the states playing semantic games with its statutes to frustrate Federal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.428" offset="11615887">This is a long-standing... long-standing immunity lack of authority in the state courts, which is grounded in the Florida constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.950" offset="11654026">And it seems highly unlikely that... well, I should say answer... make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.188" offset="11674924">It seems (a) highly unlikely that Congress would have wanted to sweep away such a jurisdictional limitation simply by enacting a cause of action, as it did in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.060" offset="11714421">And, secondly, the supremacy clause clearly under this Court's precedence of its own force does not impose an obligation on the state courts to entertain actions under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.582" offset="11752560">And let me address the meaning of 1983 in particular because that's something that Petitioner I think sort of runs away from and... and for a very good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.171" offset="11782862">It is quite clear that when Congress enacted 1983, it was not intending to impose special burdens on the state courts or force litigation into the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.361" offset="11823613">As Justice O'Connor pointed out in her opinion in Felder, when the statute was originally enacted it vested exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.150" offset="11854751">And while that exclusivity has been stripped away during the course of routine housekeeping revisions of the judicial code in subsequent years, there is no indication in the language of 1983, or any other Federal statute or in any of the legislative history, that Congress intended to force litigation into the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.928" offset="11925908">To the contrary, I think it is established beyond any dispute, the statute was enacted precisely because Congress mistrusted the state courts, because Congress wanted to create a Federal court remedy for deprivations of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.104" offset="11986617">And the Court has said over and over, it has become almost a truism that Congress constituted the Federal courts the primary vehicles for enforcing Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.727" offset="12025069">It seems very hard to believe that a statute written with that goal in mind was designed to impose a special, unusual obligation on state courts to disregard the neutral limitations on their jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.425" offset="12731942">And again, I think that is analyzed in standard preemptions terms of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.479" offset="12752109">Since it is a Federal question, what the Federal statute needs, the question of whether any defense or any modification of the cause of action or procedural exhaustion requirement or whatever is valid must be a Federal question, and it turns on what Congress meant when it wrote the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.073" offset="12814489">The precedent question of whether or not the case can get into state court in the first place is a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.477" offset="12832148">If Congress had wanted in 1983, not only to create a cause of action, open to the same extent that state court causes of action are, but had also wanted to override limitations on state court jurisdiction, it would in terms have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.217" offset="12883035">It would have said state courts must entertain these actions, notwithstanding limitations on your jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.188" offset="12902992">But it plainly... plainly didn't do any such thing, in fact, as I said when I wrote the statute, it vested exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.396" offset="13059831">I mean, there are always an element of the forum shopping when there are... when there's concurrent jurisdiction and two courts are open.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3318.519" offset="13420321">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.837" offset="13425546">The fourth case that I would have cited in this Court's line of what we call intermediate cases where there is an entertaining in the state court of a similar cause of action is Testa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.045" offset="13474342">And Testa was a decision written in 1947 by Justice Black and it, I think, contains important language on the question on which we're thrashing around here about jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.321" offset="13535469">In Testa, Justice Black said it doesn't make any difference how you characterize the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.577" offset="13564517">Whether you put it on jurisdictional grounds or was done in Testa, on the ground that the Federal government was a foreign sovereign and, therefore, the state of Rhode Island would not enforce a foreign penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.920" offset="13625853">The... Justice Black answered that by saying from the Federal viewpoint how you characterize it is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.240" offset="13655110">The question is do you have a Federal cause of action which, had it not been Federal rather than state, would have been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.929" offset="13685934">And the answer was yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.996" offset="13690218">Rhode Island had a similar statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.750" offset="13705160">The other argument in that connection is a slight misapplication of the idea of the neutral rule, that if a... this claim should be barred because the court does not otherwise entertain this type of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.645" offset="13780811">The question is whether it entertains the class of claims, which it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.283" offset="13799306">It entertains tort claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.599" offset="13808605">Therefore, under the authorities I cited, the fact that it wants to eliminate the Federal claim means it's doing it only on a Federal--</text>

Justice Brandeis said, the Alabama courts, the courts of general jurisdiction, they can entertain these claims, it must entertain this claim and not discriminate merely because it's Federal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.285" offset="14035348">It has to be defined as membership in a class which is recognized and enforced.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3478.439" offset="14059903">What about membership in a class of lawsuit defendants?</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.843" offset="14077562">You know, it really just depends of what level of generality you're talking about.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gardner W. Beckett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3486.479" offset="14092086">That's correct and we think that there is guidance from this Court on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.548" offset="14112357">The other argument that we have in our brief which this Court I think would be interested in is the so-called half-loaf argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.352" offset="14143600">It's quite clear from such cases as Maine against Thiboutot and Felder that once the state courts entertain a 1983 action, they may not give a half loaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.077" offset="14186545">And in effect, that's what they are doing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.629" offset="14196680">They say we will entertain it, but we won't entertain it against the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.064" offset="14214444">The question is when you entertain it, must you bring with the Federal cause of action all of the baggage that it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.004" offset="14246209">And that answer to that is yes and in this case the liability of the school board is established by this Court's decision in Doyle against the Mt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.658" offset="14280795">Healthy School Board.</text>
