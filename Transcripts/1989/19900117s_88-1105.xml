            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87154">The opinion of the Court in No. 88-1105, Guidry versus Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund will be announced by Justice Blackmun.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="8.968" offset="122994">The petitioner, Robert Guidry, is a former official of the respondent, Union, and a former trustee of the Union’s pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.990" offset="171059">He pleaded guilty to embezzling funds from the Union and has been incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.829" offset="202406">His Union employment, however, made him eligible for benefits from three pension funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.985" offset="231036">Guidry filed suit in Federal Court against the other two plans when they concluded that he had forfeited his rights to benefits because of his criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.128" offset="271578">His own Union intervened, and it and Guidry stipulated to the entry of judgment in the Union’s favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.253" offset="304075">The District Court, however, rejected the contention that Guidry had forfeited his right to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.653" offset="329675">It imposed a constructive trust in the Union’s favor on Guidry’s pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.861" offset="358514">In doing this, the court concluded that a narrow exception to the Employment Retirement Income Security Act was appropriate where the Union and the member’s pension plans were damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.696" offset="417864">The Tenth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.196" offset="427895">In an opinion filed today, we reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.772" offset="442210">We hold that the constructive trust violated the statute’s prohibition on assignment or alienation of pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.322" offset="480349">A constructive trust remedy is prohibited unless some exception to the general statutory ban is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.376" offset="512636">It is also inappropriate, we feel, to approve any generalized equitable exception to ERISA’s anti-alienation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.551" offset="553283">That is a task for Congress, not the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.246" offset="568121">This decision is unanimous except that Justice Marshall does not join part 2C of the opinion.</text>
