            <text syncTime="15.510" offset="193017">The third case before the Court today involves whether a debtor's pre-bankruptcy payment alone from its general operating account for trust fund tax obligations excludes that property from a bankruptcy estate subject to avoidance as preferential transfers under Section 547.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.221" offset="267937">For the reasons which I shall present to this Court, I would respectfully present that such transfers are, in fact, avoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.077" offset="299284">The Petitioner in this case is the court-appointed Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee in the matter of American International Airways.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.449" offset="332825">The debtor was a commercial airline carrier that provided scheduled passenger and air cargo service throughout the eastern and central United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.622" offset="373471">As a carrier, the debtor had many employees and was required to pay wages to those employees and was further required to withhold taxes from those employees' wages, was required to withhold individual income taxes, the employer's... the employee's share of Federal Insurance Corporation taxes, and was further required to retain certain excise taxes which it collected from the passengers' tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.606" offset="473468">By the first quarter of 1984, the debtor had become... had experienced financial difficulties in the payments of its... of its debt... of its debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.128" offset="515473">Similar to many companies in this type of situation, the debtor failed to file and pay its tax returns on a timely basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.484" offset="548910">The debtor funded only net payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.952" offset="562807">The IRS imposed extraordinary remedies for the enforcement of the collect... for the enforcement of these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.708" offset="593840">It issued a notice changing the debtor's tax filing requirements from a quarterly basis to a monthly basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.945" offset="618813">It also required the debtor to make deposits into a certain designated depository.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.349" offset="640443">The debtor followed these guidelines and on April 30th transferred two checks to the government, one out of the specially designated account and the second check in the amount of $734,797 from the debtor's general operating account.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.226" offset="703868">The debtor and the IRS agreed to specific application of these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.179" offset="723721">Two further payments were made out of the general operating account just prior to the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.881" offset="742529">One for $200,000, which was applied to 941 withholding taxes and the second in the amount of $11,636 which was applied to Federal unemployment taxes and also to Form 11 taxes for the year 1982.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.978" offset="822882">The debtor's financial difficulties continued, whereby on July 19th, 1984, the debtor filed its petition under Chapter 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.568" offset="853288">Problems persisted and a trustee was appointed two months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.353" offset="868439">During the administration of the bankruptcy proceeding, the trustee instituted this instant action, seeking to avoid the three transfers made out of the debtor's general operating account.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.077" offset="915355">Following a trial, the bankruptcy court ruled that the trustee was entitled to avoid $700,410.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.981" offset="942941">The District Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.599" offset="949419">On subsequent appeal to the Third Circuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the bankruptcy court and district court findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.789" offset="982124">The Third Circuit, relying principally on the dissenting opinion of the D.C. Circuit in Drabkin v. The District of Columbia, found the ability of the debtor to make the pre-petition payment of withholding taxes regardless of the source of those funds impressed those funds with trust characteristics, removing the property from the debtor's estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.456" offset="8612805">Well, we know in this case because of the black letter law that a trustee may designate any funds, its personal funds, its corporate funds, whatever it wants to, as trust funds taxes or... as the trust property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.691" offset="8709772">And I think that's what Congress contemplated in the House report which this Court has viewed as authoritative of Congress' intent in 1978.</text>
