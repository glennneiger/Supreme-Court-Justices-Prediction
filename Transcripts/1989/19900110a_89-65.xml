            <text syncTime="13.908" offset="129547">The Army operates schools for the dependents of personnel stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.378" offset="151385">This case arose when the union that represents the teachers at those schools made a number of proposals relating to wages and fringe benefits, including a proposal to increase wages across the board by 13.5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.756" offset="216900">The Army refused to negotiate, relying on various provisions of the Federal Labor Management Relations statute and on a statute and a regulation specifically directed to the dependents' schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.231" offset="270817">The FLRA held that the proposals are negotiable in a divided opinion, and the court of appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.670" offset="300596">We believe that the Army's refusal to bargain is justified for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.240" offset="322853">First, Congress did not make wages negotiable in the Federal sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.125" offset="342392">Second, it instead gave agency management control of agency budgets.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.798" offset="369142">And third, the salaries of teachers at the dependents' schools are to be set by comparison with the salaries of teachers at the local public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.170" offset="410624">Before I discuss those three reasons, I'd like to emphasize that it is undisputed that the vast majority of Federal employees may not bargain about pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.712" offset="456704">The pay of most Federal employees is set by the general schedule and such employees, about a million and a half in all, are paid what Congress says in the general schedule they are paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.447" offset="579689">A... there is nothing in the act that says general schedule employees cannot bargain about wages in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.920" offset="605602">However, the portion of the act that makes... that mandates bargaining, says that bargaining is not permitted where a matter is specifically provided by Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.394" offset="663489">That is Section 7109(a)(14)(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="152.148" offset="682507">In addition, Section 7117 provides that a proposal cannot be in conflict with a Federal law, and a... and a proposal to pay someone differently than what Congress has set in the Federal schedule would be contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.641" offset="744469">Both the union and the FLRA would agree with that I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.962" offset="761710">They would not agree with our third point that the management rights provision which gives management control of the agency budget also means that... that the pay of general schedule employees can't be set by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.989" offset="5857886">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.757" offset="5868962">The Authority's holding in this case, affirmed by a unanimous court of appeals, stands on three eminently reasonable points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.161" offset="5894562">First, that the compensation paid to a Federal employee for work performed constitutes an aspect of that employee's work relationship with his or her employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.601" offset="5928312">Indeed, compensation is probably the primary condition upon which the employment relationship is initiated and maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.355" offset="5955375">So for the relative handful of Federal employees, such as those in this case, whose compensation is not established in statute, compensation is a mandatory bargaining subject under the Federal Sector Labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.145" offset="6002500">The authorities second point is that simply because a bargaining proposal entails an initial or facial cost, that is not enough of a reason in itself to conclude that implementation of the proposal will interfere with the agency's budget right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.155" offset="6054536">Rather, that agency employer must show that the real cost impact of that proposal, after its compensating benefits are taken into account, will require the agency to seek more money through the budget process to conduct its affairs than it had originally determined was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.848" offset="6117334">And that is a showing that the employer agency in this case has not made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.216" offset="7606732">An agency that shows that there's enough of a chance, that there is a substantial amount of money that will be needed or a significant amount of money that would be needed to be obtained in addition to what they thought they need to run the schools, I would think would win their compensating benefits analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.665" offset="8208593">--Well, it does not include wages because of the operation of the statutory exclusion from the substantive definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.651" offset="8240462">It does not exclude wages because of the substantive definition itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.586" offset="8252270">And that is a large part of our point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.772" offset="8260942">Yes, indeed, Congress did seek to make pay nonnegotiable for the great majority of Federal employees, but it did it in 7103(a)(14)(C), not in the substantive definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.446" offset="8307649">The term personnel policies, practices and matters affecting working conditions clearly fits wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.063" offset="8326144">All three of those categories, we think, eminently cover wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.849" offset="8341295">Indeed, we think a claim that the main quid for working... the quo for working, is compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.085" offset="8370239">And we think that is plain in terms of just looking at an employee who is dissatisfied with his or her pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.109" offset="8402317">That employee will seek to sever that employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.493" offset="8419871">So pay can go to the very existence of the employment relationship itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.464" offset="8435754">And, indeed, we think it's a major failing of the schools' case here, that they have offered us no workable theory whatsoever for why it is that compensation does not constitute personnel policies, practices and matters affecting working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.289" offset="8491029">But the strength of that point, that compensation is a condition of employment in this case for these employees, is supported not just by the plain language of the definition itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.497" offset="8531885">It is also supported by the executive order practice that took place prior to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.901" offset="8557485">Both Executive Orders 10988 and 11491 delineated the scope of bargain subjects by saying that personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions were within the scope of the bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.910" offset="8617566">And that language is obviously virtually identical in all significant respects to the definition of conditions of employment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.182" offset="8646614">And really, contrary to my brother Wright's remarks earlier in the argument that the executive orders did not reference conditions of employment, in the preambles to both those executive orders, Congress did just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.657" offset="8696560">It said that employees should be able to work... to negotiate on the conditions of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.942" offset="8717667">In Section 11(a) of the executive orders it then said that personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions were proper bargaining subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.880" offset="8753403">So we think it plain that Congress was looking in the statute to carry over that executive order practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.986" offset="8781824">And I would also indicate that in the Federal Labor Relations Council's Merchant Marine decision, which we've cited in our brief, Congress did explicitly say that compensation... or the Council, rather, said that compensation is a personnel policy and practice and matter affecting working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.782" offset="8853086">And the only way under the executive orders that compensation was made non-negotiable, was through its being established in legislation and that is precisely the system that Congress carried over under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.272" offset="8907003">So the situation in Federal sector labor relations at the time that Congress considered the statute was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.111" offset="8934379">Compensation did constitute personnel policies, practices and matters affecting working conditions and was only non-negotiable if it was established through legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.884" offset="8969488">And there is nothing in the legislative history of the statute which shows that Congress wanted to change that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.538" offset="8996028">In fact, there are a number of indicators that Congress wanted to maintain just that state of affairs under the statute, both in its language... in its choice of language in the statute and the debates that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.929" offset="9041586">As to the language, we've already seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.863" offset="9049318">Congress adopted the same substantive parameters for the bargaining relationship and it made pay non-negotiable for most employees by... by inserting the proviso that matters specifically established in Federal statute are non-negotiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.788" offset="9101040">That's just the way it was done under the executive orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.974" offset="9113788">And I would also point to Section 7135(b) of the statute where Congress said that it wanted, among other things, the decisions of the Federal Labor Relations Council to continue in effect or until changed by the statute itself or through decisions of the FLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.317" offset="9179199">And neither of those events have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.602" offset="9188289">So we think it plain that Congress' treatment of the executive order practice makes it clear that it intended to carry that practice over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.792" offset="9221099">But the debates among the key legislators in the bill also support that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.826" offset="9241161">The legislators... and among them I am speaking of Congressmen Clay, Ford, Udall and Collins, who are among some of the most important figures in the enactment of the statute... all said and made clear their understanding that compensation would not be negotiable under the statute because it would be set by legislation of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.923" offset="9321618">And we have cited these passages on pages 28 and 29 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.227" offset="9338859">And these remarks must form our backdrop for the selected excerpts from the legislative history that the schools rely on so heavily here, where legislators would simply say that pay would be non-negotiable without specifying how that result would be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.236" offset="9398836">And yet that is the key inquiry for the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.272" offset="9410957">How is that result to be achieved?</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.322" offset="9419212">And as I've indicated, we think it plain that the only intent for those remarks can be to make it non-negotiable through operation of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.794" offset="9453067">And I can state this conclusion with a very sound foundation, and that is the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.484" offset="9479816">Because if Congress really meant by those remarks that it wanted to pay... make pay non-negotiable as a subject matter per se, it would have said so in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.154" offset="9514507">And yet we will look long and hard in that law before we will find an express exclusion of pay matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.869" offset="10001429">And the... this is a Merchant Marine case where the panel went with the employer's point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.894" offset="10265475">In concluding on the conditions of employment point, I would just like to note briefly concerning these... this battle over the outside statutes that we seem to be engaged in here, inappropriate as it is, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.035" offset="10322004">Nonetheless, we think these outside laws are very much supportive of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.772" offset="10336946">The National Labor Relations Act expressly equates wages with conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.474" offset="10355754">We would also prefer to look closer to home for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.510" offset="10367979">That is, the Senior Executive Service Act, which again expressly equates compensation with conditions of employments, as we've pointed out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.131" offset="10402461">The Senior Executive Service law is another title of the Civil Service Reform Act, Title IV, the Authority is under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.403" offset="10439555">And here in the Reform Act itself is Congress' recognition that compensation is a form of a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.676" offset="10476649">So if we are to engage in this... this debate about what do outside law show, we think, if anything, it's supportive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.929" offset="10505592">But the real point, we think, on conditions of employment, is to look at our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.733" offset="10520848">That's the statute that's before us and that statute defines the very term that we are seeking to construe and apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.804" offset="10549165">And it does it in a way that clearly encompasses compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.458" offset="10567764">And that should be the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.008" offset="10577899">I would just like to conclude on the condition of employment point by being so presumptuous, I think, as to suggest to this Court what kind of opinion it would have to write in order to grant the schools' position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.218" offset="10626800">First of all, it would have to explain why it is that compensation is not a personnel policy, practice or matter affecting working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.287" offset="10655013">Failing that, it would have to engraft under the statute an exception for pay which is not in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.691" offset="10676642">It would also have to explain why it is that the key legislators in the statute kept saying that pay would be non-negotiable because it would be regulated through legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.297" offset="10715094">And the Court would also have to identify exactly where it is in the legislative history that the... that the Congress decided that it did not want to carry over the executive order practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.855" offset="12233331">As a final matter, I would like to turn to the issue of Section 241 and the agency regulation which purports to implement that statutory section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.079" offset="12286203">And here we deal with the Authority's compelling need criterion as to whether the regulation is a nondiscretionary implementation of a statutory mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.952" offset="12325700">In other words, is this regulation the only regulation that can be written to be consistent with the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.839" offset="12349210">And we submit that it clearly is not, that the regulation is an exercise of discretion by this agency and therefore cannot bar bargaining under the Federal Sector Labor Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.814" offset="12393200">Even a cursory examination of Section 241 reveals that it does not require identity of compensation between Section 6 schools and local schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.085" offset="12430294">Rather, Section 241 sets two goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.971" offset="12441788">The first is of comparable education quality to local schools, and the second is that that education be provided at a comparable cost or equivalent cost to local schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.493" offset="12479927">Overall per-pupil costs, I would stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.862" offset="12493406">But it is clear that this section does not restrict the discretion of how the agency goes about meeting those bottom-line statutory goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.635" offset="12524440">Under Section 241 these schools have the discretion to bargain on these pay proposals and still to meet those goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.955" offset="12557772">Schools can configure their costs over the various aspects of providing an education in a variety of different ways, and no one way can be said to provide a better education than any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.596" offset="12604270">It would simply be a different approach to the problem of providing a quality education to students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.083" offset="12626213">For example in this case, Section 6 schools could seek to teach math through... in order to implement these proposals, could teach math by hiring more master's degree teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.760" offset="12680965">And because, if they... if there were salary increases in the schools, then they would be attracting more highly-qualified people to teach in the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.199" offset="12718686">And therefore, they could teach with higher quality people but be teaching may be with pencil and paper instead of having bachelor's degree teachers, which would teach with electronic calculators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.179" offset="12806667">First, with respect to the first issue as to whether wages are negotiable conditions of employment, I believe Justice White pointed out that it appears that the FLRA's position is that Congress deliberately left wages out of the... out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.439" offset="12875630">It knew that 97 percent of the employees couldn't bargain about wages, and so it took wages out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.128" offset="12910425">We think that rather than... that this Court would have to engraft wages into the statute to... to write an opinion going the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.916" offset="12945534">With respect to the legislative history on that issue, no one ever said on the floor of Congress that employees, like these teachers, could bargain about pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.808" offset="12989106">With respect to the other statutes that have been mentioned, not one of those makes wages negotiable without saying wages are negotiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.432" offset="13031633">On the budget point, as I understand the discussion that went on, the FLRA's position is not only that intangibles might outweigh the costs but that--</text>
