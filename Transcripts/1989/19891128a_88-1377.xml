            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="11.560" offset="180737">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.715" offset="213338">The court of appeals, in this nationwide class action, invalidated the central regulatory requirement that has governed eligibility for children's disability benefits since the outset of the Supplemental Security Income program in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.775" offset="273629">The regulation at issue provides that in order to qualify for benefits a child must have an impairment or a combination of impairments that is included in the Listing of Impairments in the regulations, or is equal in severity to a listed impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.382" offset="328068">We submit that the court of appeals erred for four reasons in invalidating these regulations on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.327" offset="351787">First, the regulation Respondents challenge is supported in a number of respects by the text and legislative nistory of the definition of disability in Title XVI.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.423" offset="392225">Second, the regulation requiring that a children's impairment meet or equal a listed impairment was adopted in 1974 at the outset of the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.420" offset="436215">It therefore represents a contemporaneous interpretation of the act by those charged with its initial implementation, and a consistent and long-standing interpretation of the act as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.137" offset="475085">Third, Congress ratified this regulatory requirement that Respondents challenge in 1976, soon after the SSI program got underway.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.454" offset="516359">Specifically, in the 1976 unemployment compensation amendments, Congress directed the Secretary to publish the objective criteria that he was then developing internally to implement the regulation, and to use those criteria to determine disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.731" offset="573410">And the special Part B Listing of Impairments utilized for children were issued the following year, pursuant to that statutory directive and special delegation of legislative rule-making authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.381" offset="616042">And fourth, the Secretary's regulatory approach adheres to the functional orientation of the Social Security Disability programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.497" offset="652509">The Part A Listing, which children can also qualify under, is principally applicable, or was designed for adults, and it identifies those impairments which the Secretary has determined would render an adult unable to work, which is itself obviously a functional predicate for the Listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.317" offset="723771">The Part B Listing has the same thrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.639" offset="733071">In 1974, in fleshing out the statutory standard of comparable severity, the Secretary, after a two year study in the initial implementation of the SSI child's program, with the aid of physicians and other experts, identified those impairments that have an impact on a child's growth and development that is comparable to the effect that an impairment has on an adult's ability to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.327" offset="839859">Therefore, the Part B Listing carries forward the functional orientation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.880" offset="858040">Furthermore, some of the specific listings under Part B require a further and explicit consideration of functional aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.194" offset="891268">For example, and of particular relevance in this case, is... are the mental impairment listings.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.007" offset="914569">For example, the mental retardation, under which Respondent Zebley and Respondent Raushi were evaluated, specifically provides for consideration of functional aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.566" offset="964724">I call the Court's attention in this respect to page 233 of the joint appendix, where the mental retardation listing is included.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.594" offset="1004849">I am informed by the Department of Health and Human Services that 40 percent of the children who are found disabled are found disabled because of mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.730" offset="1041420">And Listing 12... 112.05 identifies the qualifying standards as, in the alternative, achievement of only those developmental milestones generally acquired by children no more than one-half the child's chronological age, and IQ of 59 or less, or an IQ of 60 to 69, inclusive, and in addition a physical or other mental impairment imposing additional and significant restriction of function or developmental progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.027" offset="1154582">This is at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.649" offset="1161061">So, it seems to us particularly odd in this case that the claim would be leveled that the special Part B Listing is not faithful to the functional orientation of the act, both because functional standards are imbedded in the Listings themselves, as the Secretary specifically announced when the Part B Listing was adopted in 1976, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="316.559" offset="1400760">One is, of the... if the impair... if the specific impairment is not listed, if the specific criteria for the impairment are not listed, the child can still establish that he meets the level of severity set forth in the Listings by showing that he... that his particular impairment equals a listed impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.111" offset="1466902">And in determining that, in matching something to the Listings, what the decision-maker has to do is look for the medical signs and findings and symptoms of the impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.286" offset="1503683">One of those findings are functional, would be the functional limitation imposed on the child as a result of his impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.229" offset="1527402">If those functional limitations match the level of severity in the Listing, he will be found eligible.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.553" offset="1728754">The reason that a... that an adult would be found disabled at step 5 would typically be, not because of the severity of his impairment standing alone, but because he, in addition, has an adverse non-medical factor, a... an adverse vocational factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.263" offset="1791552">He is of advanced age, he is of poor education or he has poor job training.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.048" offset="1814644">Congress specifically provided, in paragraph (B) of the statutory provision here, for those vocational factors to be considered in the case of an adult.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.327" offset="1995830">--As to that, Justice O'Connor, I... the Respondents and some of the amici, I think, have a misapprehension about the way the Listing works.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.371" offset="2023937">The Listing is not a listing of diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.255" offset="2035536">It is a listing of mental and physical impairments.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.184" offset="2047239">The statutory term is mental and physical impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.088" offset="2058837">And what the Listings do is go body system by body system and identify impairments to the body system.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.910" offset="2082138">For example, the ability to move a limb, or the... or mental impairments, cognitive or emotional, or other... other disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.557" offset="2112754">What the Listings do is identify impairments in the body system.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.598" offset="2124875">Any one impairment might be due to a variety of different diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.281" offset="2143578">For example, Down syndrome, as we point out in our brief, Down syndrome children are typically quite mentally retarded, and the experience, as we point out in our supplemental brief, with Down syndrome is most Down syndrome children are found disabled because they meet the mental retardation listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.373" offset="2224035">And if the Down syndrome child would have other disorders associated with that, such as a digestive problem or something of that sort, then you would look to that body system listing to see whether the effect of the impairment on that body system renders him disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.108" offset="2310971">So, the fact that a particular disease is not listed as such under the Listings is really beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.422" offset="2332182">And again, the statutory definition of disability for an adult refers to an individual who has a physical or mental impairment, that he is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a physical or mental impairment, which is the effect on the body's ability to perform, not the medical diagnosis of a particular disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.627" offset="2413057">And for children, I... in further response to Justice O'Connor's question, for children the statutory standard in the parenthetical at the end of the statute... of the statutory definition of disability is for a child with a mental or physical impairment of comparable severity.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.488" offset="2488499">In other words, for adults the standard of disability is defined in terms of... the ultimate question is ability to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.392" offset="2516084">Is the adult unable to perform substantial gainful activity by reason of his impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.186" offset="2539281">In other words, the ultimate question is that by... unable to work by reason of impairment, the disability to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.600" offset="2560911">For children, though, the statutory standard is the impairment of comparable severity.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.313" offset="2583794">That phrase does not focus on the end result of whether the child can work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.904" offset="5094161">--Well, I think it is a problem in Respondents' misconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.806" offset="5105760">Respondents' allegation is not as to the Secretary's practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.560" offset="5120702">As I understand their argument in the citations in the brief, it is entirely based on what they perceive to be the language of the regulation, which they say precludes consideration of functional impair... functional limitations resulting from an impairment, in deciding whether something equals the Listings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.300" offset="5183709">The Secretary does not construe his own interpretive ruling in that way, and under Udall v. Tallman the Secretary's interpretation of SSR 83-19 is entitled to very substantial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.718" offset="5245358">And, after all, 83-19 is itself an interpretive ruling that interprets the regulation, which does provide for an equivalency determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.434" offset="5280257">But beyond that, I mean, several factors point out that Respondents are incorrect in assuming that the Secretary has read his own regulation to bar consideration of functional impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.743" offset="5329472">For... we discuss both these things in the supplemental brief that we filed last Wednesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.638" offset="5349012">In the typescript version, in footnote 6, we cite the... a passage from the physicians' training manual, which is sent out to the physicians in the field who are specifically charged with making a determination of whether a child's impairment equals the Listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.279" offset="5407631">And this instruction pertains to adults, but the point I am going to make pertains to children as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.301" offset="5427693">It says medical equivalency permits a physician to arrive at a judgment that the findings, although not exactly mis... matching the listed criteria, have the same effect as a listed impairment with regard to inability to perform work-related activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.950" offset="5482341">For a child the concept would be that, in deciding equivalency, you can see whether the child's impairment, although not listed, has the same impact on his ability to perform the sorts of functions to which that body system relates as a listed impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.962" offset="5546393">And the other point I would make, that we also point out in our supplemental brief, is that the... Secretary, through SSA, undertook a study of the child's disability program this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.270" offset="5595608">And the preliminary results of that study, requested by the Senate Finance Committee in its consideration of pending legislation, evaluated and discovered certain areas where the Secretary thought that there... that there should be additional attention to making sure that adjudicators are fully complying with the Listings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.340" offset="5667810">And one of the areas in which the study described areas in the men... area of mental impairments, was that as to those that were found not to equal the Listing, erroneously, they were almost exclusively based on the failure to consider how all documented impairments combined to affect the child's overall functional capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.565" offset="5756731">So the Secretary, in evaluating decisionmaking by lower... by... in the sample of cases that were obtained, specifically reaffirmed the idea that this... that the equivalency concept is not construed or applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.921" offset="6166226">The question in this case is simply whether the admittedly disparate treatment afforded children is consistent with the language passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.258" offset="6203529">Congress, as Mr. Kneedler correctly pointed out, required that children were to be treated in such a way that if they had an impairment or combination of impairments of comparable severity to that which would disable an adult, then they would be found disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.307" offset="6259745">It is our belief, and it is adequate... amply supported by the record, that that is simply not the case, that the Secretary frequently has a great deal of difficulty dealing with children who have impairments that combine a number of different factors, or that are not on the list... on the very short list that the Secretary has.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.347" offset="6447931">The Secretary's interpretation, as promulgated by Ruling 83-19, which is the only thing on paper that addresses the question of equivalence, quite simply states that functional consequences are not to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.175" offset="6495160">To quote briefly from that ruling, at joint appendix page 240,</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.550" offset="6512715">"The functional consequences of impairments, irrespective of their nature or extent, cannot justify a determination of equivalence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.054" offset="6546674">And that, quite frankly, is at the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.986" offset="6558481">The Secretary does not have an adequate means with which to address the difficult cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.379" offset="6580006">Yes, it is true that many retarded children do quality for disability benefits because their retardation meets the Listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.074" offset="6606755">But the problem is those children who have a combination of impairments, or who have a rare disease, that simply does not come on the Listing or that have an atypical amount of functional loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.550" offset="6648656">The Secretary's argument seems to be, at least insofar as the Listings incorporate function, it seems to be that the Listings represent the Secretary's estimate of the typical impact of an impairment upon the typical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.301" offset="6719709">But that is not the way that the Social Security Act is supposed to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.955" offset="6734337">The Social Security Act is supposed to function in order to make case-by-case determinations of each individual, not only looking at that child as an individual and matching his findings up with the Listings, but also to determine how those impairments actually affect that particular child, what that child can do and what that child cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.348" offset="6815944">I think a good illustration of the problems that the Secretary has with more rare diseases is found in the Wilkinson case, which is... which is cited in both our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.599" offset="6880937">In that case the child there suffered from a rare liver disorder that meant that he swelled up at night, that he ran fevers three or four times a week, that he constantly cried, he couldn't leave the house; he was allergic to all standard food.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.541" offset="6956692">But the, that particular rare liver disease was not on the Listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.384" offset="6979993">He was also, as a result of the toxic chemicals that were thrown off by his liver, slightly retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.770" offset="7005593">The Secretary's defense of that case was that the closest listing was the mental retardation listing, and since his retardation didn't yield him an IQ of under 69, that he simply was not disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.836" offset="7053867">There is no doubt that an adult in that case would get a very different examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.506" offset="7156476">That would go a long way toward resolving the problems that we have with the Secretary's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.797" offset="7173717">The remaining problem would be that the Listings for children are modeled to reflect exactly the same degree of impairment that is used for adults, in that process that is used for adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.468" offset="7236411">The problem with that is that for... the Listings do not represent the inability to perform substantial gainful activity, they represent a much higher cut, a cut that allows the Secretary to make presumptive determinations for the people who are so impaired that there is just no question that they can't perform substantial gainful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.132" offset="7319062">In fact, the Secretary, with an express delegation of authority from Congress, has set the Listings at the level that is used for determining disability among disabled widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.409" offset="7368173">Disabled widows are found to be disabled if they cannot perform any gainful activity, which, according to the legislative history of that provision, is to be a much more stringent test than the test used for workers both in the Title II program, and in the SSI Title XVI program that was modeled on that Title II program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.607" offset="7472976">A number of courts, including the court in Willowford v. Harris, have criticized the mechanical results that sometimes occur from using a Listings-only approach for widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.186" offset="7539222">But whatever may be the shortcomings of that approach for widows, Congress clearly did not say that children shall be found disabled if they have an impairment of comparable severity to that which would render a widow disabled under the standard in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.766" offset="7597528">And those were the two standards of disability that were in the Act at the time of original passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.748" offset="7617485">On the one hand you had the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity, which was the test for workers, and then there was also the test for disabled widows, which was the inability to perform any gainful activity under regulations promulgated by the Secretary to so determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.189" offset="7687284">Congress meant to help children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.495" offset="7708496">All of the brief legislative history of the original SSI Act showed that there was grave concern for what Congress called among the most disadvantaged of young children... of all Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.253" offset="7755516">And the Secretary's approach of conflating the process for children and adults... I am sorry, for children and disabled widows, into one test, which is seen throughout his regulations and clarifying rulings, is simply inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.245" offset="7835451">Mr. Kneedler made the suggestion that many of the adults who qualify at step 5 do so because they have adverse vocational factors: they are approaching advanced age, they are poorly educated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.648" offset="7909116">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.170" offset="7923222">However, 20, fully 25 percent of all the qualifying adults, according to the Secretary's figures, quality because they... at that step 5, because they have either a medical or a medical/vocational set of problems that renders them disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.909" offset="7986125">It is very clear from the Secretary's regulations and the cases in this Court, that a person with no adverse vocational factors, a young person, well educated, with job training, could quality as disabled even if he or she did not meet the Listings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.699" offset="8049342">That is what the City of New York case was all about, where apparently there was some subregulatory documents that gave the impression that if a younger worker had a mental impairment that left him extremely disturbed, but he did not meet all of the criteria of the Listing, Social Security was assuming that the fact that he didn't meet the Listing meant that he must therefore be able to perform substantial gainful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.480" offset="8168460">That position was renounced by the Secretary after being criticized in the district court and in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.496" offset="8204509">And in this Court, the Secretary only addressed himself to the question of remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.738" offset="8225407">The Secretary explains that, Counsel, by saying that for an adult like that, a young adult like that, the statute provides a clear criterion: the ability to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.646" offset="8269084">It provides no such criterion for a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.948" offset="8282249">And therefore you have to resort, the Secretary says, to comparable severity, which is what the statute says, which in turn forces you to look to particular functional disabilities and see if the child has them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.697" offset="8453299">I think by looking carefully at the wording that actually exists in Ruling 83-19, which states that functional impairments cannot be looked at in order to arrive at a conclusion that someone has a impairment that rises to Listing level, which in and of itself is a more difficult test than an adult would ever be put through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.162" offset="8555177">But even putting that aside, Justice Scalia, the Secretary does not allow a child with atypical symptomatology to show that even though he doesn't meet A, B and C, that his impairments are so severe in A and B that he should be found to be disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.657" offset="8641172">That is why we find the Secretary's practice of awarding benefits on children's eighteenth birthday, because when they reach 18, then they can be looked at with a... in a holistic functional approach, and then they can be awarded benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.109" offset="10034961">Not necessarily that looking at function is automatically going to qualify someone as disabled, but rather that one needs to look at the overall function, just as one does for adults, to avoid mechanical results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.218" offset="10083340">To avoid assuming that because the typical effects of a particular impairment are as they are in the Listings, that they may not actually take place or affect an individual in quite that typical way.</text>

Mr. Kneedler, you are treating this as though the question whether a regulation can be stricken on its face is the same as whether a law can be stricken on its face as unconstitutional, and the test there is whether in any of its applications it could be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.815" offset="11413809">Surely the test for regulation is not whether in any of its applications it can be valid.</text>
