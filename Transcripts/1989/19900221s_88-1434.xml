            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87142">The other case is 88-143, Dole verus the United Steel Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.774" offset="122146">The case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.800" offset="146283">Among the regulatory tools available to government agencies charged with protecting public health and safety are rules which require regulated entities and disclose information directly to employees, consumers, or others.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.219" offset="212007">The disclosure rules protect by providing access to information about what dangers exist, and how these dangers can be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.816" offset="250355">Today we decide whether the Office of Management and Budget has the authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 to review such regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.401" offset="304690">We hold that the Paperwork Reduction Act does not give the Office of Management and Budget the authority to review and control agency regulations mandating disclosure by regulated entities directly to third parties and therefore, affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.595" offset="389431">Justice White dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice has joined.</text>
