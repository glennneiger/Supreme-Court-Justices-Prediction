            <text syncTime="12.509" offset="194048">Mr. Brodsky.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_brodsky" startTime="19.544" stopTime="438.336">
            <label>Mr. Edward Brodsky</label>
            <text syncTime="19.544" offset="222260">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.417" offset="245666">The issue in this case is whether or not the act of state doctrine bars the prosecution by the plaintiff of this action which we say that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.116" offset="300523">The facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.018" offset="312122">In 1982 our client, W.S. Kirkpatrick Company, entered into an agreement with the Government of Nigeria to supply equipment on an air base, a military air base, in Nigeria.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.871" offset="379518">The equipment was part of... was to be used in an aeromedical center in Nigeria as part of its defense program.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.657" offset="422672">The equipment were things like ejection seats for jet aircraft and centrifugal machines to train pilots.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.873" offset="459557">In connection with obtaining this contract with the Government of Nigeria, our client paid an intermediary, not an official of the Government of Nigeria... our client paid an intermediary an amount of money which, pursuant to an arrangement with the intermediary, was to be used as bribes to officials of the Government of Nigeria.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.972" offset="583900">The amount of money paid was about $1.7 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.094" offset="596438">The total contract price was about $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.367" offset="609500">In 1984, our company was indicted, along with our chief executive officer... actually, it was our predecessor... for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.827" offset="663312">We pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.078" offset="672402">And after that, the plaintiff in this case brought an action against us and is claiming that it is entitled to damages because, but for our bribe, it would have obtained the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.339" offset="745441">It is suing us under the RICO statute, under the Robinson-Patman Act, and it is suing us under a New Jersey RICO statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.855" offset="787446">It is not suing under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.220" offset="804895">The district court agreed with our position, even after receiving a letter from the legal advisor to the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.507" offset="858081">That letter was requested by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.520" offset="870097">And the letter that was received by the district court was kind of inconsistent, internally inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.854" offset="903429">One the one hand, it said that the State Department had no objection if this case would go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.252" offset="937075">But, on the other hand, it also said that discovery in this case might seriously affect... that's a quote from the letter... might seriously affect United States foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.090" offset="1000396">Therefore, the district court said, look, I'm not a member of the State Department, I'm not an expert in foreign relations and this case should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.146" offset="1036654">The court of appeals disagreed in the Third Circuit and the court of appeals made a distinction between something which motivates an act of state... namely, in this case we say the act of state is the awarding of the contract itself... and the validity of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.091" offset="1128396">The court of appeals said that we are not claiming... we disagree with this position of the court of appeals... but the court of appeals said that we are not claiming that the act of state here, namely the awarding of the contract, is an invalid act.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.892" offset="1195583">We are simply saying that the contract was achieved through bad motives, through a bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.749" offset="1231005">That evidence might embarrass the Government of Nigeria but that, the court of appeals says, makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.426" offset="1261725">It makes this bright line distinction between motivation and validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.302" offset="1285235">When the court of appeals did that, it went in conflict with the Ninth Circuit in the Clayco case which does not make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.118" offset="1328494">And that case we say on the facts is the same as this case and, therefore, the two circuits are in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.865" offset="1367469">First, with regard to the motivation validity distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.280" offset="1393173">In the first place, it is our contention here that in order for the plaintiff to prevail, the plaintiff does indeed impinge upon the validity of the act of state of the Government of Nigeria.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.883" offset="1467570">And the act of state doctrine says that the courts in the United States shall not examine and pass judgment upon the acts of foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.732" offset="1518979">Now, the act here... the act of state... is the award of the contract and what the plaintiff is saying is that we obtained this contract through the payment of a bribe; we obtained this contract, they say, in violation of the laws of the Government of Nigeria.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.756" offset="1603093">They say that they should have received the contract, not us.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.299" offset="1629215">And in doing all of that, it seems to me that the plaintiff would be required to examine the procedures of the award of the contract by the Government of Nigeria, what officials get involved in the award of such a contract, how the award is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.434" offset="1717823">The complaint in this case doesn't even say that they were the low bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.647" offset="1730675">They do say elsewhere in the record, their own statement, that they were the low bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.042" offset="1752200">But there is nothing in this record or anyplace else which would even indicate that the low bidder would get the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.116" offset="1776546">So, what they would be doing in this case and what we say that the courts in the United States should not be doing, is examining the internal workings of high officials in the Government of Nigeria on matters which directly affect the Government of Nigeria because this is a military contract, a contract that's made in connection with the air force of the Government of Nigeria.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.027" offset="1960135">What they would have to say in this case... this Court would have to say, in our view... is that the contract was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.583" offset="1990332">It was made for the wrong purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.630" offset="2186564">But I say... and, indeed again, the government has been inconsistent in this way as well... even the... well, first of all, the two courts below say that the commercial exception to the act of state doctrine would not apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.474" offset="2253960">The Solicitor General, in his amicus brief to this Court, said the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.225" offset="2320938">But I do not believe that the commercial exception to the act of state doctrine should apply in this case because we weren't dealing with, as I think one of the courts said, is this the kind of an agreement that a company ordinarily would enter into in the regular course of commerce, and it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.619" offset="2406515">This is an agreement which has to do with the security of the air force, the military of the Government of Nigeria.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas B. Rutter</label>
            <text syncTime="1727.675" offset="7054744">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.496" offset="7066029">If there is one thing that is very clear as we come to the podium it is that despite any broad statements we might find in the Oetjen or Ricaud case, or in any of the other cases, the mere fact that the conduct of foreign relations is committed by the Constitution to the Executive Branch does not mean that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.654" offset="7174698">And that's an exact quotation, if the court please, from Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion for this court in the Sabbatino case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.100" offset="7200402">What needs to be done here, I suggest, is to decide which of the several bases that are available for affirmance of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals should be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.907" offset="7239691">And I mean by that this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.007" offset="7248050">The case can be affirmed on a very narrow basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.971" offset="7263932">That is, by saying this Court's decisions in Sisal Sales and Continental Ore, which I discuss in my brief, squarely rule the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.935" offset="7303743">Those cases say very simply and succinctly that where American citizens are brought before an American court for acts which violate American law, even if those acts have the tangential involvement of a foreign government... in Sisal Sales it being the Country of Mexico and the State of Yucatan and in Continental Ore it being a Canadian agent, exporter in Canada... that nonetheless, notwithstanding those tangential involvements of the foreign countries, the American federal courts can, will, and should decide those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.067" offset="7444282">Likewise, I can take it to the broadest extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.980" offset="7455984">I'll pass for the moment the proposition that there is no act of state involved here, which I have briefed in some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.883" offset="7479599">And likewise I'll pass the proposition that Sabbatino, when you read its analysis and apply the underlying premises to this case, that you find that Sabbatino says this case goes forward and so, too, our past commercial activity exception which I think applies, and, indeed, the motivation against validity argument which is sometimes advanced and which the Third Circuit followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.728" offset="7566953">To say to you that I think in the broadest reach of this case this Court is presented with the opportunity to now say the act of state doctrine, if it means anything, means merely that in a case where foreign relations are involved, the Court will invite the State Department to express its views, and if in that first time in the history of the United States of America, the State Department says, stay your hand, we will then, as a matter of federal jurisprudence, make the determination of whether we should stay our hand applying an abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.082" offset="7716373">What I mean by that last statement is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.986" offset="7727971">The act of state doctrine, which is now 25 years old as defined by Sabbatino, but which is much older than that... the act of state doctrine, I suggest with respect, has done nothing more than give rise to a cottage industry amongst the law professors and the law commentators, and has permitted people who want to weep crocodile tears for places like the Country of Nigeria to come to federal court and say we ought not be held liable for our wrongdoing because a foreign country is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.775" offset="7843119">Let me pause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.425" offset="7849702">I think Mr. Justice Stevens put his finger on it precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.807" offset="7863286">This case would not be here, nor would we be without our verdict and judgment, if the people bribed and paid off had been an American company or, indeed, if it had been an American government, be it federal, state or municipal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.228" offset="7924935">The act of state doctrine has permitted these people... and, by the way, the depth and breadth of the depravity existing in terms of this company and these petitioners' behavior in Nigeria is set forth in their own memoranda on pages 212 to 222 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.610" offset="7998495">They were not dealing with a single intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.732" offset="8010930">They were dealing with at least two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.064" offset="8016259">And this went on for over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.986" offset="8027962">So that the depth and breadth of what occurred here is amply set forth in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.929" offset="8047815">And so, too, we have amply set forth in our complaint, paragraphs 39, 40, and 41 of the complaint, where we specifically say, but for this conduct in Nigeria, and in London, and in America, by these petitioners, we would have had this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.479" offset="8117927">We would have had the profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.122" offset="8124510">Therefore, the act of state doctrine has simply said in this case because Nigeria is involved, these petitioners, these wrongdoers, get some special benefit which would not exist if they were a straight American corporation or American government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2105.284" offset="8565144">You will recall, Mr. Justice Stevens, that as it appears in the appendix, I asked the Republic of Nigeria, through its ambassador, to take a position, namely that we could go forward with this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.209" offset="8604850">They have not responded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.922" offset="8611746">That suggests to me that that answer is at worst neutral, as I see it from my point of view in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.134" offset="8632540">It is, I suggest to you, a positive fact in my case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.103" offset="8740478">Therefore, I say to you, Mr. Justice Stevens, that their suggested defense that everybody is doing it, doing it, is not one which is going to be, (a) admissible as a matter of law, and (b) will not fly as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.020" offset="8788125">And, in any event, it is not something worthy of consideration by this Court in deciding whether the court of appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="2738.064" offset="11096304">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.279" offset="11129114">The United States supports the judgment of the court of appeals in this case, but we do so for grounds... on reasons that are narrower than those that the court of appeals itself enunciated and also those that have... some of those that have been argued by respondent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.667" offset="11194734">Let me begin by addressing the threshold question of whether there is an act of state inquiry required in this case or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.763" offset="11231096">The classic or traditional formulation of the act of state doctrine is that it applies when the courts are called to question or inquire into the validity of a public act of a recognized foreign sovereign within its own territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.414" offset="11285744">In terms of that formulation, it seems to us that the critical inquiry here at the threshold is whether this case will involve the questioning or the inquiring into the validity of a foreign sovereign act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.633" offset="11342587">And, more precisely, do those words mean only... refer only to a direct adjudication of the legality of the foreign act of state, which appears to be the reading that respondent implicitly adopts or that the court of appeals implicitly adopted, or are those words broad and flexible enough to encompass some additional types of cases that might also be understood as inquiring or questioning the validity of a foreign act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.922" offset="11447704">We believe that this case... the type of situation of this case... is one where there ought to be an act of state inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.748" offset="11475080">That, because of the need to prove causation in this case, the case, if it goes forward, could establish the factual predicate which would establish as a matter of Nigerian law that this contract is either void or voidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.537" offset="11530146">And that that type of situation sufficiently implicates the general policies of the act of state doctrine that at least an inquiry into the act of state question ought to be undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.314" offset="11573300">Second, let me address very briefly the commercial activities--</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.365" offset="11629516">Remember, in that case, the allegation was that a foreign government, Costa Rica, had been induced by an American company to engage in expropriate... acts of essentially expropriation against another American company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.354" offset="11685418">It's hard to read the case as saying that the Court, if it head the case, would have to inquire directly into the legal validity of the acts of the Costa Rican government, but, nevertheless, this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.517" offset="11762113">It was an antitrust action brought to recover damages in the United States and the cause of the damages was the act of expropriation--</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="2913.503" offset="11798058">--but the defendant who was alleged to have violated the antitrust laws by conspiracy and so forth... whether their conduct was legal or illegal could have been determined without determining the legality of the expropriation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.872" offset="11851557">I think the reaction of the court in that case was that essentially what was being alleged was that Costa Rica was a puppet of an American corporation and that that type of inquiry was of sufficient... had sufficient implications for the conduct of America's foreign relations that such an inquiry ought not to be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.876" offset="11919580">That obviously isn't directly parallel to this case and the two are obviously distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.840" offset="11943403">But we think it provides at least some inferential support for the proposition that the narrowest possible reading of the act of state doctrine, that it only applies where there is a direct adjudication of illegality, is not necessarily one that this Court's cases require that it adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.487" offset="11997947">Let me address briefly the commercial activities exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.789" offset="12011217">We agree with the petitioners that this act, the decision to enter into a defense procurement act, is sufficiently sovereign, that the case should not, by that reason alone, be held to fall within the commercial activities exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.712" offset="12090943">What we said in our brief was that it's nevertheless relevant under the type of comity... international comity analysis that the Court has undertaken in Sabbatino and succeeding cases, that the relationship the parties would enter into once this decision was made to enter into the contract would be commercial in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.134" offset="12164608">So, for example, questions about breach of warranty, questions about other issues that might come up in the governance of the contractual relationship we think, for example, would fall into the commercial exception for this Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and if there were a commercial activities exception recognized, would presumably also those questions would come within a commercial activities exception of the act of state doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.520" offset="12246110">So, because the relationship that would be entered into is commercial, we think that's one factor that the Court could weigh under a comity type analysis in deciding whether or not the act of state doctrine precludes giving a questioning... or not giving effect to the act of a foreign sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.961" offset="12315909">I'd also like to speak, if I could, to the general question of the institutional relationship between the federal courts and the executive branch in applying the act of state doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.288" offset="12353212">It's a matter that this Court has not spoken to in an opinion enjoined by a majority of the Court and is also of some considerable institutional interest to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.567" offset="12398352">The position that we've taken in our brief in this case really attempts to build on two principles that we think there is a fair consensus about within this Court's opinions, even though the Court has not reached a concluded view about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.296" offset="12453209">One is the principle that the courts, of course, are the final arbiters of question of law, and the second is the principle that the Executive Branch ought to be the final arbiter of questions of foreign relations and foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.416" offset="12509738">And the way we propose that these two principles can be reconciled in this area is that when a court undertakes an act of state inquiry in deciding whether or not the act of state doctrine should in any particular case preclude examination of a foreign sovereign act that any questions about the foreign relations impact, about sensitivities of foreign governments, about the consequences for ongoing American diplomatic efforts, that those questions ought to be referred to the legal advisor of the State Department through the Justice Department and courts should give the very greatest deference to those determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.692" offset="12650799">But that the legal elements of the doctrine, including the threshold questions about whether it is or is not an act of state, in the final determination after the courts engaged in the balancing process would, of course, remain for the courts themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.561" offset="12710254">We think that this reconciliation is one that is consistent with all this Court's prior opinions, including the rejection by six Justices in--</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.699" offset="12750796">So what if... so, giving all the deference you suggest to the State Department's letter you would still say that... that the Court should make an independent inquiry as to whether there is an act... the act of state doctrine isn't law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.095" offset="12848389">But other elements in the doctrine, for example, the question of whether an act is sufficiently sovereign to trigger the act of state, or whether or not the act took place within the territory of a foreign government, those questions--</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.612" offset="12938460">Our position is that the State Department letter is not a trumping device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.073" offset="12956327">We think that that's the reason why six justices primarily rejected the Bernstein approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.599" offset="12978479">The Bernstein approach was perceived as one where even if the court concluded as a matter of law that the act of state doctrine precludes adjudication, that the executive could come in and say, no, we want you to go ahead anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.255" offset="13017036">And six justices in the First National City case thought that that was an impermissible relationship between the executive and the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.609" offset="13042531">And we don't question that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.540" offset="13046189">We are simply suggesting that when the court undertakes the Sabbatino-type analysis looking at the various factors in the case, and to the extent that those factors include questions like what will be the impact on ongoing diplomatic efforts of the executive, that it should refer to the State Department and get the State Department's views on those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.543" offset="13118182">In this particular case, there were two letters, as has been noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.320" offset="13149320">The letter in the district court we think can fairly be read as saying that there would be no adverse impact on the foreign relations of the United States if the case goes forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.637" offset="13190593">But if there is any ambiguity about that, we think that reference to the letter, which is appended to our brief, should resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.643" offset="13214626">In that letter, the legal advisor... this is at page 2(a) of the appendix in our brief... states quite expressly that we do not see any foreign relations obstacles to adjudication of this case on the merits and we also believe that, in the absence of a representation to the contrary, the courts may properly assume that no unacceptable interference with U.S. foreign relations will occur on account of adjudication of like cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.827" offset="13303338">So, in response to this Court's grant of certiorari the State Department has undertaken a reevaluation of the foreign policy implications that suits of this type present and has determined that, as a general matter and absent a representation to the contrary, we do not see sufficient foreign policy obstacles to going forward and considering a case of this nature on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.328" offset="13469372">The second letter says at the end, the legal advisor to the State Department reminds the trial court to exercise appropriate supervision over the trial process so as to limit damage to foreign sensibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.189" offset="13528827">Now, what I'm saying is that there are no rules for a district court to follow in presiding over a case and limiting that case to things that will involve foreign sensibilities.</text>
