            <label>Ms. R. Claire Guthrie</label>
            <text syncTime="28.519" offset="259023">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.122" offset="273443">This case comes to you today by way of an interlocutory appeal from a case pending in the Eastern District of Virginia which concerns the administration of the Virginia Commonwealth's Medicaid Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.403" offset="318583">The case concerns, fundamentally, the significance of action Congress took in 1981 when it amended the Social Security Act by way of what is now commonly called the Boren Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.789" offset="368111">The Boren Amendment granted states new authority to set Medicaid payment rates for in-patient hospital services.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.214" offset="393815">Exercising this new authority in 1982, Virginia adopted a prospective payment system as its method for reimbursing hospital rate... hospitals for expenditures for Medicaid patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.072" offset="445224">In March of 1986, Respondent in this case, The Virginia Hospital Association, brought suit challenging our prospective payment system on the ground that it violated the terms of the Boren Amendment because it under-reimburses Virginia hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.763" offset="511993">Accordingly, the hospital association argued that our system is inconsistent with Federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.088" offset="537280">The Commonwealth moved for dismissal or summary judgment on several grounds, including, among other things, the Eleventh Amendment and the lack of enforceable right under Section 1983 and collateral estoppel, and the district court initially granted judgment on the collateral estoppel grounds, but that decision was ultimately reversed by the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.111" offset="613453">We're now before you on appeals from subsequent decisions by the district court and the Fourth Circuit that rejected the Commonwealth's grounds... remaining grounds for dismissal, and from a decision fundamentally that... in which the Fourth Circuit ruled that the Boren Amendment guarantees cost-efficient hospitals, a substantive Federal right to reasonable and adequate reimbursement, and that this right can be enforced under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.461" offset="722854">The Commonwealth sought certiorari on four issues, but the Court decided to grant and to hear only this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.505" offset="750961">I intend to focus my argument today on two key points relevant to our principal argument, which is that the Boren Amendment, as drafted, does not secure any substantive Federal rights that can be enforced under Section 1983.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="166.055" stopTime="174.272">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="166.055" offset="809162">Ms. Guthrie, do you think that the legislation, as it was written before the Boren Amendment, provided a private cause of action?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_claire_guthrie" startTime="174.272" stopTime="318.310">
            <label>Ms. R. Claire Guthrie</label>
            <text syncTime="174.272" offset="842076">I think, Justice O'Connor, there's a much better argument that could be made there, but we would not concede that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.129" offset="865482">There is a distinct difference in the language between the Boren Amendment and its predecessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.541" offset="887112">And that language... the change in the language is to incorporate the express findings and assurances requirement and also to expressly repeal the cost-based reimbursement standard reflected in the prior language.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.849" offset="948343">The prior language said that a state plan for medical assistance must provide for the payment of the reasonable cost of in-patient hospital services.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.535" offset="975092">That language is somewhat similar in nature to other standards incorporated in the Social Security Act that this Court has held enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.801" offset="1012186">But what's important about the Boren Amendment is that it doesn't say that anymore, that it makes a very significant change that must not be overlooked by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.329" offset="1050325">The Boren Amendment reflects congressional intention to interject the free enterprise system into the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.123" offset="1077492">Under cost-based reimbursement, hospitals could argue that they were entitled, essentially, to present a bill to the Commonwealth and to have it paid, regardless of whether the charges made or the bill presented was in fact necessarily related to the services that the Medicaid recipients were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.317" offset="1154292">It is that fundamental change that we would stress in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.800" offset="1176130">And our second important point today is that the language of the Boren Amendment itself doesn't secure any substantive Federal rights within the meaning of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.898" offset="1216568">The only requirement, we would submit, that the Boren Amendment now imposes on the states is an administrative obligation to make findings and assurances to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, an administrative obligation that relates to how we administer our program, not to any entitlement to hospitals, and certainly not to anything that would remotely resemble an industry subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.324" offset="1314266">Alternatively, we would argue that even if the Boren Amendment could be said to impose an obligation to make payments to hospitals, the standards for determining the level of payment to be made under the Boren Amendment are too imprecise, too general, too open-ended to secure any specific and Federal... specific and definite Federal rights in any party.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="318.310" offset="1418233">But what about a Federal right to a good-faith determination by the state, and to a good-faith assurance?</text>
            <text syncTime="325.056" offset="1445192">At least that is categorical in the act, is it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="328.628" offset="1459507">Your Honor, we would argue that in fact the finding... the findings and assurances language requires that the Commonwealth be accountable in making assurances to the Secretary, and certainly the presumption of regularity of administrative and state action would obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.811" offset="1532232">And we wouldn't, obviously, expect a state to make a finding or submit an assurance that was patently false or inaccurate.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.107" offset="1565355">I'm sure you would, but let's assume a state doesn't, and there's all sorts of evidence that this is all tricked up and it's as phony as can be.</text>

          <turn speaker="r_claire_guthrie" startTime="363.244" stopTime="392.383">
            <label>Ms. R. Claire Guthrie</label>
            <text syncTime="363.244" offset="1597956">Well, I think that what I would hear in that particular question and would submit is the proper argument in that particular case is that what the state has done is arbitrary and capricious, and that might, in fact, state some sort of constitutional plane that possibly could be enforced under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.627" offset="1683533">But we would argue that a statement that our findings and assurances are arbitrary and capricious does not state a claim under this particular statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="392.383" stopTime="408.722">
            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="392.383" offset="1714462">Could you sue the Secretary under the APA if he accepted those assurances when the assurances were obviously insubstantial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_claire_guthrie" startTime="408.722" stopTime="697.700">
            <label>Ms. R. Claire Guthrie</label>
            <text syncTime="408.722" offset="1779872">We... we think that there's an argument that could be made that the Administrative Procedure Act would permit someone to sue the Secretary for not living up to his obligations, but we do not believe that argument is persuasive in this case because of the nature of the right arguably created, which is one to findings and assurances.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.618" offset="1863464">And the findings and assurances that are required are so defined by what comes after that language that by their terms they are more like the indefinite language this Court recently referred to in Webster v. Doe, language that might even foreclose a proper Administrative Procedure Act review.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.823" offset="1952281">The findings and assurances require the state to make a number of different, almost legislative, certainly policy-laden judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.160" offset="1997629">First, if you look at the actual language of the statute, it says that a state plan for medical assistance must provide for payment of hospital services through the use of rates, so we're making payment for the use of rates, which the state finds and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary are reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applicable quality and safety standards and state and Federal laws, and to assure individuals eligible for medical assistance have reasonable access.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.615" offset="2139422">Buried in that somewhat labyrinthine language which is added to an already... which you have already characterized as a byzantine statute, are several mandates for findings: one, the state has to look to see what is the care and services that must be provided in conformity with applicable state and Federal laws and regulations and quality and safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.513" offset="2231059">And once we know what the level of care that's required is, then we have to ask, now, what are the costs that have to be incurred... have to be incurred by an economically and efficiently operated hospital in order to provide that level of care?</text>
            <text syncTime="536.344" offset="2290305">And once we've determined what those mandated costs are... because economic and efficient here is a limitation, not an expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.221" offset="2321861">It's meant to avoid overpayment, not to raise questions about underpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.965" offset="2340878">Once we know the answer to the question of what costs are necessary, only then do we get to the issue of whether the rates that we set after that analysis are reasonable and adequate to meet those costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.705" offset="2387794">And only then, once we've established the rates, do we know anything about payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.418" offset="2402632">Now, when you look at that complexity, and when you look at the kinds of judgments that are buried and required of the state in that language, I think it's absolutely necessary to conclude that is the sort of language where there is substantial discretion delegated to the states that it is not the kind of language ordinarily determined by this Court to support a finding of specific and definite rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.368" offset="2518406">Contrast the language of the Boren Amendment not only with its predecessor, which specifically talked about cost-based reimbursement, but contrast it too with sections of the Social Security Act that this Court has already found enforceable, such as Section 1902(a)(8) of the Social Security Act, which is the part of the act that was at issue in Edelman v. Jordan, one of your most important holdings about enforceability of rights under Section 1983, under the Medicaid Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.208" offset="2641809">That section required that a state plan provide that all individuals wishing to made... make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have the opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished by reason... with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.711" offset="2715787">Shall have the opportunity to apply for assistance; that assistance shall be provided with reasonable promptness... very clear language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.153" offset="5449554">That is, of course, very different from the situation prior to 1980, when these lower case... court cases were decided, when the repeal of the Eleventh Amendment immunity and the repeal of the repealer took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.531" offset="5499082">Perhaps there was a right of action at that time, but the one thing that's clear is that Congress made a significant change at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.507" offset="5535027">It not only changed the standard from reasonable cost, but it also inserted the language of findings and assurances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.501" offset="5558955">It left the responsibility for rate-setting with the states and not to be second-guessed in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.358" offset="5590406">It is telling, I think, that there is no explanation in the plaintiffs' submission to this Court, or of that of their amici, as to what they thought Congress was trying to do when they made this change, when they inserted the requirement of findings and assurances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.617" offset="5655399">And it seemed... the one thing that is clear with respect to the Secretary is that they wanted the Secretary to back off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.643" offset="5679536">His review was not to look at the rates, but to assure proper accountability, to make sure that the findings were made, and it seems curious to suggest at the same time that Congress was pulling the Secretary back, it nonetheless intended that every provider have a right to challenge the level of its rates in Federal court before a Federal judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.338" offset="7062354">So Congress in 1975 passed legislation requiring states to waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity and consent to be sued not only for injunctive relief but for money damages as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2903.624" offset="11759484">--Conceivably the Virginia Supreme Court would decide differently, but it's important to note that once you're closed out of the state administrative appeals process, because it doesn't allow you to challenge the principles of reimbursement, there's nothing in the Federal Medicaid Act that requires state court judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.919" offset="11840672">So that any review that might exist by happenstance, the availability of which would be entirely a matter of individual state law, cannot, as this Court held in Wright v. City of Roanoke, foreclose a remedy under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.411" offset="11906605">The state simply doesn't identify, as we can see it, any plausible basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.136" offset="11925518">I think in the end that what happened in 1980 and '81 was very significant for what Congress did not say, after manifesting its concern with provider remedies and having an extensive legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.376" offset="12002527">The Congress is said to have taken away and extinguished provider's right to sue, with no mention... there's not a word in the legislative history, the extensive legislative history in '80 and '81, that says, oh, in addition, we're making another major change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.066" offset="12105241">We're extinguishing the right of providers to sue in state and Federal court which we've legislated about in '75 and '76.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.400" offset="12138573">It's being extinguished by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.052" offset="12145156">That is, in this case, the dog that did not bark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.314" offset="12162187">There's not a word that Congress was withdrawing a right of which Congress was fully and clearly aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.311" offset="12194266">It seems to me that two approaches have been argued here today to take away the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.527" offset="12235121">One of those approaches would have this Court hold that a state's plan always meets the statutory standard, no matter how arbitrary, capricious, unsupported or untrue its plan might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.737" offset="12279947">The other would acknowledge the existence of the statutory right but shut the doors of the state and Federal courthouses to the only effective means that providers have of enforcing the requirements of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.375" offset="12346507">I think either one of those approaches would breathe an unhealthy skepticism and a lack of respect for Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.522" offset="12379108">The state says... it takes umbrage in its brief at our suggestion that... they're saying that a false finding satisfies this statutory standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.313" offset="12434174">But the state itself says that we acknowledge that the Commonwealth has made the findings required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.147" offset="12465521">I thought, when did we ever say that... acknowledge that the state had made the required findings under the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.391" offset="12498540">They cite the complaint, footnote 12... I mean, the complaint, paragraph 12, which says that the assurances and findings provided by the Commonwealth were inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.639" offset="12539500">The state... the heart of the state's position is, as it must be, that a state's requirement to find is satisfied by an inaccurate finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.866" offset="12580460">That simply does not square with what this Court held in Wright v. City of Roanoke, where the statute said the regulations involved spoke of reasonable utility... reasonable amounts of utilities determined in accordance with the Public Housing Authority's schedule of allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.498" offset="12654961">I don't see any difference between what the state finds to be reasonable and adequate in this case and what the state authority determined to be reasonable in City of Richmond Public Housing Authority, in Roanoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.589" offset="12723298">It seems to me that if the state's finding is to mean anything, then this case is one in which--</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.357" offset="13934439">The Virginia Hospital Association tries to make much of two lines in the legislative history of the Eleventh Amendment repealer about not wanting to change the status quo ante with respect to Federal and state rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.788" offset="14004134">What they haven't told you, and which a careful reading of all of the cases that they refer to in their footnotes will show you, is that most of the cases that had been in existence up 'til that point... the pre-1981 cases... most of the cases involved suits against both the Secretary and the states, and in most of those cases the relief granted was against the Secretary, making the Secretary go back and do his job over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.592" offset="14095353">The amici American Hospital Association brief recognizes that fewer than half of the cases that were decided before 1981 involved any 1983 claim at all, many of the issues regarding provider rights were resolved on questions of standing, which is why you see the parallel interest language and the zone of interest language in many of the cases, and even the Colorado Hospital case that they cite to... cited to in argument today is a case eminently distinguishable from ours.</text>
