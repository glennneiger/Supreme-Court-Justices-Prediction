            <text syncTime="1430.365" offset="5870520">But in reversing the lower court, this court said that the linchpin of the Fifth Amendment is not reliability, it's coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.629" offset="5895493">So, any coerce statements by a governmental agent simply cannot be used for any purpose whatsoever because, as Justice Stewart put it, in that case the court was dealing with the constitutional privilege in its most pristine form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.726" offset="5939901">That's what the Fifth Amendment is for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.656" offset="5947634">It's to exclude an evidence from evidence a class of testimonial evidence, compelled statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.562" offset="5975324">But with the Fourth Amendment, as contrasted to the Fifth, this Court has reached a different result.</text>
