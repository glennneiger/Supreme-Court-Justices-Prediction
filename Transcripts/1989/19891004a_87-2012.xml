            <text syncTime="18.494" offset="222888">Mr. Weston.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Weston</label>
            <text syncTime="20.136" offset="229471">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.925" offset="244622">These three consolidated cases present various challenges to this Dallas licensing ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.821" offset="272207">The FW/PBS Petitioners and the M.J.R. Petitioners, bookstores, motion picture theaters, arcades, cabarets, attack the ordinance on various First Amendment grounds arising from their communicative activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.033" offset="337096">The Calvin Berry, III Petitioners, motels, are included within the scope of the ordinance solely because they provide room rentals for periods of less than 10 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.761" offset="384012">They assert a different challenge, the absence of any justification for including them within the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.334" offset="410343">If the Court please, I will turn to the Berry matter first.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.189" offset="425703">Under the ordinance, hotels or others providing rooms for rent for less than 10 hours are qualified, or are included as sexually oriented businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.765" offset="476067">And also under the ordinance no one may rent rooms for less than 10 hours unless they have license under the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.130" offset="509504">On its face, this legislation applies not only to Petitioners' hotels, but also to the Hilton, to Holiday Inn, the Sheraton, as well as other hotels and motels which provide accommodations for those in the airline industry and truckers and others on travel-sensitive and short schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.973" offset="584841">Given the lack of any reference whatsoever in this record or in the entire legislative process to short-term rental establishments, Petitioners respectfully assert that the scheme as to them is over inclusive and irrational, and is violative of equal protection and due process of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.330" offset="682330">And if the Court please, I will now turn to the arguments of the other two Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.244" offset="705945">Respondents invite this Court to make radical and wholesale reductions in the most basic protections of the First Amendment which have traditionally safeguarded expression in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.382" offset="762474">They attempt to justify their ordinance by several quite remarkable propositions, including their statement that under the ordinance no religious or political discourse would be restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.462" offset="822764">I suppose, fairly, their argument extends to that if speech does not contain a component of religious or political discourse, it is then subject to lesser and perhaps ultimately no First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.034" offset="885145">If the First Amendment is to have any continuing long-or short-term validity, Respondents arguments must be resoundingly rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.687" offset="923701">This Court has consistently held over a long, long period of time--</text>

            <text syncTime="230.874" offset="1072495">There is... certainly consideration charged for the expression, but this Court has continually held that the fact that there was a charge attendant to expression itself, whether it be in the context of the sale of a newspaper or the sale of a book or the selling of an admission ticket for a ballet dance or for theater, certainly was no indication--</text>

            <text syncTime="261.135" offset="1193494">Can't... can't a state require a license of these people the same way it requires the licensing of other people, for purposes of collecting a sales tax--</text>

            <text syncTime="269.459" offset="1226826">--Well, of course, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.400" offset="1230588">I'm sorry, our point is not that a license per se is impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.063" offset="1245216">Of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.804" offset="1248142">But rather that any license of this nature must be construed, must be evaluated, as this Court always has, as a prior restraint in the beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.714" offset="1307806">And as this Court recently noted, its... in summarizing its decisions on prior restraint, that a prior restraint is classically that circumstance where government can deny or does deny a form in advance of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.114" offset="1361409">One may not engage in the speech until one has a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.897" offset="1376560">One may not obtain... one does not get the license simply on paying the filing fee and paying... and paying one's money and filing the application.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.410" offset="1406653">So requiring a permit for a parade, then, is a prior restraint?</text>

            <text syncTime="322.195" offset="1437791">As the Chief Justice well knows, not all prior restraints are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.447" offset="1450748">They simply start off requiring the extremely heavy scrutiny of this or any constitutional court, and they come to this Court or any other court with a heavy presumption against their invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.266" offset="1494007">That is the only point that we make.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.497" offset="1498918">And because the governmental power inherent in these prior restraints is so extraordinary, a set of rules involving strict scrutiny has of course been set up to ensure that government does not, intentionally or unintentionally, abuse the extraordinary power which these devices give them.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.794" offset="1652100">We certainly think that there is nothing that indicates that the founders or the framers had any such concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.630" offset="1679476">We see no justification for doing so, and quite frankly, the response I guess to the implied question might well be why, and followed by what next.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.867" offset="1720436">The establishment of any hierarchy of speech diminishes ultimately the value of all speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.189" offset="1873723">This speech is, in essence, speech or pure speech, which is to be construed and viewed exactly in that context, separate from the commercial, commerciality of the message, which lends the potentially second-class status to commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.652" offset="1943522">The point I was going to make, Justice Stevens, is simply that the aspects of commercial speech seem really to be more akin almost to a time, place and manner circumstance with respect to it, rather than the content of the message of the commercial speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.477" offset="7514918">While the Petitioners have raised a myriad of issues, I believe the critical issue in this case is whether the city has a justification for the licensing provisions in the ordinance that is unrelated to the... to the suppression of speech, and whether these provisions are substantially broader than necessary to achieve the city's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.162" offset="7593598">It is clear from the circumstances that led to the adoption of the ordinance that the city has ample justification for these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.419" offset="7630588">In 1985 and 1986 the City of Dallas was experiencing a proliferation of sexually oriented businesses in the city, as were many other large urban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.199" offset="7677713">They were beginning to cluster in some areas and then they were beginning to open up in small neighborhood shopping centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.123" offset="7709478">So the city council determined that it should investigate the effects of these businesses, and did so by looking at studies from other cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.639" offset="7751483">It... it became evidence from these studies that there are serious problems of crime and urban blight associated with sexually oriented businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.897" offset="7792547">The city... the city staff collected studies from nine cities, including Los Angeles, Phoenix, St. Paul and Austin, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.222" offset="7825879">Each of these studies was consistent in their findings that these businesses foster higher crime rates and lower property values in the areas where they are located.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.688" offset="10255685">Its purpose is to prevent the evasion of the provision by simply when you are denied a... a license, getting it granted to someone else who is closely related to you, and you are the actual person running the business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2557.697" offset="10379714">These people are... intermediaries who are purveying the messages of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="2567.835" offset="10420256">Because, as the Petitioners pointed out in their Brief to the Fifth Circuit, the competition for locations under the location restriction is going to be fierce.</text>
