            <text syncTime="13.924" offset="187502">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.760" offset="198787">The Equal Access to Justice Act generally requires the United States to pay reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing party in a non-tort civil action if the position of the United States is not substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.720" offset="262630">The question in this case is whether the substantial justification component of that statute applies at the fee stage of litigation, the so-called fees for fees question.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.760" offset="306829">For three reasons we believe that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.045" offset="319891">First, the fee stage of the case is part of the overall civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.766" offset="338803">Indeed, if the fee stage of a case were not part of the civil action, then a prevailing party could not recover attorneys fees for that phase of a lawsuit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.139" offset="376315">Second, Congress limited the liability of the United States for attorneys fees to those instances where the position of the United States was not substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="418425">Nothing in the text of the statute renders the United States automatically liable for attorneys fees at any stage of the lawsuit, at the merits or at the fee stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.035" offset="455936">And third, the best reading of the text of the act, and the one that best serves its purposes, is that the substantial justification requirement applies at the fee stage of a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.593" offset="502121">The fee stage and the merit stage are conceptually distinct, the legal issues involved are quite different, and the United States can and often does take different positions in fact and law at each stage of a lawsuit.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="105.750" offset="554784">Well, what is there in the statute which justifies our making the distinction between the merits stage and the fee stage?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.339" offset="581115">You have mentioned fee stage very adroitly now six times, I've noticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.125" offset="600237">Aren't we going to hear that there is no basis for that dichotomy?</text>

            <text syncTime="121.112" offset="616224">No, Your Honor, it is that point where the parties really disagree, and it is that point that I was about to address right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.599" offset="642137">Let me do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.749" offset="646735">And let's start with the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.318" offset="657079">And when you look at the statute we think you first have to look at the forest and not just the trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.122" offset="676201">The reason is the very existence of an attorneys fees statute is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.324" offset="697099">It modifies the American rule; it's a partial waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.560" offset="714026">What a fee statute does is create a new cause of action for a plaintiff and impose a new form of financial liability on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.000" offset="747776">In fact, the version of Section 2412 of the Judicial Code that existed before the EAJA was adopted expressly exempted attorneys fees from the costs that could be awarded against the United States in a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.058" offset="800021">The statute itself, therefore, creates an entirely new claim that is separate from the dispute on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.295" offset="824890">Now that is not, we think, a novel proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.080" offset="836070">This Court's cases, beginning with its 1982 decision in White v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, have recognized that the fee stage of a lawsuit involves different issues, and is--</text>

            <text syncTime="189.923" offset="891450">Supposing you have a case in which there is quite a difference between the liability issues and the remedy issues, and you have two separate stages, liability and remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.712" offset="926558">And it is determined that your position on liability was not substantially justified, but there were substantial merit to your objections to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.683" offset="954457">Would you... would you just get fees for the liability part of the lawsuit?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="209.468" offset="969608">--Well, that is one way to break the statute down.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.639" offset="982356">It would be to decide that the merits and... excuse me, the liability and relief stages are discrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.943" offset="1007538">And if the United States was not substantially justified at one stage but was at the other, then a party would get attorneys fees only for that stage where the United States was not substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.214" offset="1048602">There is an even simpler way to break down the statute if you wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.850" offset="1063127">What you could... if you look to the statute it requires a party to file a fee request within 30 days of the entry of a final non-appealable judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.372" offset="1097295">You could draw the first line right there.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.935" offset="1171482">If a lawsuit ends in a settlement... and the statute uses that term to describe when a lawsuit ends, so it contemplates that a lawsuit can end in a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.256" offset="1200740">The settlement may be a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.958" offset="1211607">The consent decree may contemplate that there is future litigation down the road over questions such as whether the United States lived up to its obligations under the decree, whether the decree should be modified or whether the decree should be entirely vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.385" offset="1265314">In that sort of circumstance you have a relief part of the action, if you will, that extends well into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.205" offset="1292586">Generally we think you can collapse the two, because in the vast majority of cases what a person is going to be claiming is, for example, an entitlement to benefits that were wrongfully withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.478" offset="1333651">When the United States pays over those benefits, that's the end of the case as far as what that party was trying to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.649" offset="1358310">Where you have a lawsuit that is going to extend into the future, for example in a prisoners lawsuit where he claims that the law library at a Federal prison was not adequate and a consent decree is entered, you are going to have then litigation extending into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.891" offset="1415362">And we think in that case you would have perhaps three lines, not... not the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.955" offset="1903538">The prevailing party inquiry that is made under Hensley is the one that is normally made under most fee statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.026" offset="1927884">This statute is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.193" offset="1932482">It also adds not only a prevailing party... not just a prevailing party inquiry, but it has a substantial justification inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.513" offset="1957768">And we think the statute can logically be read so that the two should be made virtually simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.834" offset="1983055">You can apply the two to the same stages of a lawsuit, and therefore you could decide whether someone prevailed at a particular phase, and even if they did, whether we were nonetheless taking a reasonable position at that stage, either the agency or the United States in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.693" offset="2038539">And specific provisions of the act we think also show that the attorneys fee stage is clearly a separate stage of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.116" offset="2076260">Before a court can award attorneys fees it has to make an inquiry into a variety of different issues that arise only at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.870" offset="2103218">Those questions typically involve the inquiry whether or not a party was a prevailing party, whether that claimant is eligible for a fee award, whether the number of hours that were spent on the case were adequately documented and are otherwise reasonable and whether there is present in the case a special factor justifying an award of fees in excess of the fee cap, which, due to inflation, is now about $100 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.852" offset="2203215">Even if the only inquiry that the court makes at the fee stage is whether the position of the United States was substantially justified, that inquiry, too, is distinct from the one that is made at the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.693" offset="2238532">As the Court held in the Pierce v. Underwood case, the question at the merits is whether the government was correct, while the question under EAJA at the fee stage is whether the government's position, although incorrect, was nonetheless reasonable.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ira Jay Kurzban</label>
            <text syncTime="1558.932" offset="6367447">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.265" offset="6376851">I would like to begin by taking up Justice White's point on the fees accrued in litigating the fees, because that goes to the heart of what this statute is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.156" offset="6416348">Congress clearly intended to make fee litigants whole, to the extent that they could under this statute, by awarding them their fees not only for the underlying merits, but for the fees in litigating the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.647" offset="6470369">Not to do so would undermine the purpose of the act, because it would establish an economic deterrent that this Court noted in Sullivan v. Hudson should not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.320" offset="6505060">In this case, and our case here I think amply demonstrates the problem, we need to look no further than the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.276" offset="6540900">The statute talks about substantial justification and the position of the United States in terms of the government's underlying conduct, as well as their litigation position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.999" offset="6587711">The government studiously avoids the 1985 amendments to this act, because those amendments make it crystal clear that the government's position is not tenable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.374" offset="6633269">In our case, in 1981 the government engaged in activity by incarcerating 2,000 people, and then not publishing a regulation that their own counsel advised them to do a the agency level, clearly were not substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.353" offset="6705158">We then have spent, since 1982, seven years, almost eight years now, litigating solely the fee issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.608" offset="6738176">Congress could not have intended, and clearly said so in the 1985 amendment, to allow us fees for the underlying litigation, but then allow the government to--</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.157" offset="6836397">That's correct, but the government's position has not been advanced one iota since that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.996" offset="6863773">Because the reality is that the Haitians were released, and the government came to this Court, and in Your Honor's opinion you noted specifically that the government conceded in this Court, and the dissent noted that for the first time the government conceded that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.307" offset="6940991">The reason I asked you the question was because I got the impression from what you've said that all the litigation in this case since 1981 had been over fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.747" offset="6978712">And I thought that was a mistaken impression.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.051" offset="6991982">But the fee litigation did begin in 1982, and we did file our first fee petition in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.888" offset="7019358">It is true that there was other litigation as well, but they... they went forward simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.406" offset="7037331">And it is also true, and the point that I wanted to make is that that other litigation would not have been necessary if the government had made the concession that they made in this Court, which is that their regulations and statutes were neutral and nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.951" offset="7103577">The government's argument also, in many respects, tortures and certainly strains the language of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.474" offset="7137641">To take Justice Kennedy's point, there is nothing in this statute that indicates that fees should be separated into different aspects of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.246" offset="7172749">The statute talks of fees in the civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.115" offset="7188214">To reach the government's position in this case, this Court would have to amend the statute not once, but twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.618" offset="7214232">You would have to amend it to say that fees and substantial justification are determined at different stages of the litigation, which the statute does not say, and you would have to read out, as the government does in their brief, the question of substantial justification with respect to the government's underlying action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.866" offset="7403254">And that is why we think that the government's concerns here are purely hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.736" offset="7422689">The government's description of absolute fee shifting, the government's description that they would have to pay untold fees, is completely unreasonable and unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.509" offset="7457798">What we are saying is substantial justification, consistent with the statute, like prevailing party in Hensley, is a threshold determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.615" offset="7490189">Once that determination is made, just as in Hensley, then it's a matter of the district court's discretion as to what is a reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.368" offset="7521223">And on the facts in this case, for example, to the extent that the government won in the court of appeals and to the extent that we then submit other applications for fees for those, the court... the district court judge can take that into consideration and make a determination that we are not entitled for X number of dollars for pursuing one issue that the government won on, but we are entitled to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.115" offset="7600217">What we are saying is not that the district court doesn't have broad discretion, because I think that was the point of the statute, but that the government shouldn't be allowed to come in and allege different issues, as they are suggesting here, at different phases, the substantial justification threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.375" offset="7661239">They have all the protection they need under a Hensley rationale with respect to what a reasonable fee is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.064" offset="7696034">And the statute specifically contemplates that, because the statute says in the appropriate sections, in Section (1)(C) and in Section (2)(A), that plaintiffs are entitled to a reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.390" offset="7749324">In Section (1)(C), to the degree that the plaintiffs are unreasonable in prolonging the litigation, at whatever phase of that litigation they are involved in, they are entitled to no fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.996" offset="7791747">So that the district court is intended to be that party to make these decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.121" offset="8248263">And I think that is what really meets all the government's concerns here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.673" offset="8262473">And those concerns are also consistent with the legislative history of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.346" offset="8293193">And I think the clearest example of that, Your Honors, is the case with respect to litigating the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.201" offset="8328511">The average case, the actual case that comes before the courts is where a fee is generated of only $4,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.806" offset="8370934">The government, I think, as Justice White was pointing out, the government can then litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.710" offset="8394549">And we assume the government in many instances may be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.580" offset="8406042">They may lose, but they are very good lawyers, they can fashion very reasonable arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.150" offset="8424328">And in the process of doing that they can run up enormous fees, far beyond the average fee in an Equal Access to Justice Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.440" offset="8461527">And that fee is $4,500; 90 percent of the fees in Equal Access to Justice Act cases are less than $3,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.510" offset="8489843">So if the government has an interesting issue, as they did, for example, in Sullivan v. Hudson, where the lawyer as a matter of record had to drop out of the case, because the government took that all the way to this Court, where the government has an interesting issue and they wish to pursue it all the way to the Supreme Court, the fee litigant is going to be discouraged from taking those kind of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.157" offset="8564345">And the thought of Congress here is we want to encourage people to take cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.275" offset="8584825">We want to make sure that they don't feel that there is a tremendous risk that down the road the government will litigate against them for... for years to come, as they have in this case, and... and wind up with enormous fees that the party cannot pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.851" offset="8843123">Well, I think first of all the government doesn't take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.853" offset="8851169">They say that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2182.455" offset="8861618">--Well, they take the position that the fees are fees in the civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.573" offset="8878023">So to the degree that they separate out, they are talking about only separating out the fees for litigating the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.244" offset="8900697">They are not talking about separating out the fees for the underlying merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.631" offset="8922327">So it's not clear that any of those analogies--</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="2200.167" offset="8932462">Well, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.733" offset="8934656">I agree, but we are talking about whether there are fees on fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.885" offset="8951270">And if this is a separate action for fees, then the question becomes whether you are entitled to fees during that litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2214.426" offset="8989513">--Well, assuming the hypothetical, and obviously we don't want to concede that, but assuming what Your Honor is saying is correct, I think the answer is that no, the substantial justification threshold would not apply, because it would defeat the very purpose of the act for the very reasons that you have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.936" offset="9051476">Which is it would allow the government to litigate issues endlessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.638" offset="9066313">It would give them a weapon that would serve as an economic deterrent for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.375" offset="9085226">I... I'd like to address just one more point in closing, which is the Russell v. Heckler point, which the government suggests is a compromise position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.331" offset="9121066">We would submit to the Court that, as the government concedes that that position is not well grounded in the statute itself, this statute is absolutely clear, and technical defenses and Russell v. Heckler types of defenses are just inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.157" offset="9184387">They are in effect an attempt to amend the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.859" offset="9199225">To amend the statute, number one, when it is not necessary, because Hensley and the reasonableness test address all those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.465" offset="9225660">But secondly, they are clearly an amendment of the statute because they allow the government to make certain litigation arguments separate from the agency's underlying conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.421" offset="9269442">And the Court, in 1985 in... I am sorry, the Congress in 1985 indisputably said that you cannot separate those; that you must look at the agency's underlying action; and that you can't let lawyers come into court, whether it is a technical defense, whether it's a Russell v. Heckler type of defense, whether it is any other kind of defense, and make the argument that because their litigation position is reasonable, that that is sufficient.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2316.708" offset="9398591">And I will make only two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.927" offset="9407473">First, the '85 amendment doesn't undermine in any way our interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.064" offset="9432028">Congress addressed a problem in '85 dealing with the front end of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.568" offset="9450000">What we are dealing with here is a problem that arises at the back end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.004" offset="9463793">There is no logical reason to assume that Congress wanted the same answer to apply in both circumstances where there are different problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.257" offset="9488766">And if anything, the 1985 amendment actually helps us in a way, because it indicates that there are two positions that have to be considered: the agency's and the lawyer's position that is taken in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.298" offset="9532965">The second point I would like to make is just that we think the statute has to be read so that the substantial justification provision and the civil action have to be read reasonably, because the statute uses them in the same sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.606" offset="9578209">If the fee stage is not part of the civil action, then they don't get fees for fees at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.843" offset="9603078">If the fee stage is part of the civil action, then the substantial justification provision has to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.163" offset="9628364">Unless the Court has any further questions, I have nothing further to add.</text>
