            <text syncTime="1351.410" offset="5551216">It is no difference to the other creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.043" offset="5557798">The only thing that the court of appeals seized on here was the notion that the responsible officers would try to negotiate their personal liability away by threatening to do various things to the debtor, maybe to force it into liquidation, if the IRS doesn't... if they are not able to get what is basically a personal accommodation from the IRS in discharging their liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.430" offset="5667304">And I would say a few things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.465" offset="5679425">One, we really think it is very inappropriate for the bankruptcy court to kind of become an accomplice in this scheme where the responsible officers take the government's money and then threaten the vitality of the reorganization in order to get out from under their liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.057" offset="5737834">Secondly, the idea of Chapter 11 is that there, is to give the corporation a chance to keep going as a going concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.061" offset="5769808">And there is no indication at all anywhere in the Code and the legislative history that Congress thought it was necessary to bribe the officers, to somehow entice the officers into cooperating with this endeavor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.096" offset="6589949">Where we seem to disagree is whether the payments made under a confirmed plan are voluntary, and the consequences if they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.536" offset="6631745">I think if there is one word that is going to become the key to the decision here it will be control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.725" offset="6660479">It is not a perfect word, but it is a good word for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.677" offset="6676257">We suggest that the tax payments under a plan are voluntary because the debtor taxpayer controls the use of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.115" offset="6710007">And we say if that is not the conclusion that this Court chooses to reach, then control must be in the bankruptcy court, and as a result the court has the power to designate the allocation of the taxes paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.959" offset="6769462">Let me start with a test that occupied the bulk of Mr. Horowitz's time, and suggest an example that we can discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.915" offset="6809273">A simple $100,000 tax debt existing on the eve of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.719" offset="6832469">Of that, $60,000 constitute so-called trust fund taxes and $40,000 anything else: income, excise, matching FICA, what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.228" offset="6886491">Now, take the day before the bankruptcy filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.382" offset="6907075">The taxpayer is in hopeless financial trouble, is insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.119" offset="6930063">The IRS may have sent out notices, demands, revenue agents, is all over the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.856" offset="6957021">The risk upon default is levy, seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.475" offset="6971545">And the corporation, a day or two before the bankruptcy sends a check, let's make it a certified teller's check, to the IRS and pays the $60,000 in trust fund taxes, thereby helping the responsible officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.917" offset="7033299">No issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.436" offset="7039359">IRS says that is fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.971" offset="7049495">And whether or not anyone is blameworthy, whether or not the IRS position is impaired and it is stuck with the nontrust fund taxes, that is fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.526" offset="7187735">It may or may not be a preference and usually will not be, because the test for a preference requires that the party receiving it do better than it would upon bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.917" offset="7229217">And because the taxes are priority, it is relatively rare that the IRS receiving a prepayment sum would be in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.642" offset="7272163">Usually there are enough free funds to go beyond the priorities, and that is why the usual preference issue concerns payments to unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.081" offset="7313958">Now, let's take the situation we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.716" offset="7328483">After the plan is confirmed, and we are in that situation right now with these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.471" offset="7363487">The taxpayer is now rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.542" offset="7379787">The plan has been confirmed by a bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.411" offset="7395252">The plan has been found feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.529" offset="7407686">The flexibility that Congress gave to the debtor to stretch out tax payments over six years from date of assessment has been utilized by the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.671" offset="7452303">It won't happen in every case, but it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.039" offset="7465782">The IRS is owed an undisputed sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.158" offset="7478216">The IRS has not sent out any notices or demands, because it is now passively awaiting the payment of the taxes under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.863" offset="7517087">The same risk of default exists as was the case before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.500" offset="7539552">And the corporation sends out the same check, although it is not likely it will be certified this time, to the Service and pays the installment that is due under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.892" offset="7589185">Now, I suggest there is little if any difference in that scenario from the pre-bankruptcy, except that it is better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.514" offset="7623666">And yet under... it is better in the sense that the debtor is more in control of its situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.354" offset="7655013">It has made its peace with its creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.156" offset="7666194">The plan has been confirmed, et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.857" offset="7677061">But this time when the IRS gets that check in the mail somebody says wait a minute, it's involuntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.508" offset="8903666">But when it did so, the IRS was put at the mercy that, at some point as those six years evolved, the debtor might not survive and might not be able to make the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.837" offset="8984959">In between these two periods that I mentioned, the pre-bankruptcy day before when the check is paid, and the post-bankruptcy day after when the check is paid, let's look at what the government suggests is so important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.549" offset="9055803">Indeed, I think that one might even question how relevant any of it is, because in light of our emphasis upon control, what we think is fairly significant is that on the day that those post-confirmations are being... payments are being made, the debtor has received the benefit of Section 1141, the assets have revested in the debtor, all creditors abound by the plan, and with full control over and custody of the funds, the taxpayer makes the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.222" offset="9198432">But it is true that the cases have focussed upon, to some measure, what takes place during the course of the Chapter 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.078" offset="9237929">So, notwithstanding my suggestion that it may or may not be terribly relevant, let's look at the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.916" offset="9265305">The debtor says... I am sorry, the government says the debtor lacks options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.486" offset="9287562">But as, I think, Justice Scalia pointed out, the debtor always lacks options to pay involuntary taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.008" offset="9321625">That is, taxes are involuntary in that the law says they arise under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.895" offset="9349211">But yet the debtor is afforded more options in a Chapter 11 than it had before, because it is given the six-year provision and it is given the hiatus period to work out of its troubles.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.941" offset="9413367">But the debtor is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.976" offset="9421518">There is... if you consider the plan a court order, the debtor is under a court order to pay taxes every so often, is it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2329.964" offset="9465403">The government made that argument in its brief, and it made it to suggest that there is some type of judicial activity taking place here that is of the nature of involuntariness, like the court approving a seizure or a levy or something of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.447" offset="9551398">I suggest that when we look at the applicable statute, which I think is Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, the one that sets the standards for when a plan may be confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.522" offset="9607718">What that statute says is that the court shall confirm a plan that meets the following requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.877" offset="9641051">Now there are, I think, 11 requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.895" offset="9653172">Some are relatively unimportant and some are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.566" offset="9671875">The two that probably are germane to this case are 1129(a)(9), that says the plan shall provide for full payment of priority taxes, but may do so over the course of six years with interest, and the Section, I think, 1129(a)(11), that says the plan shall be feasible, or the exact language is not likely to... the corporation is not likely to run into the immediate need of bankruptcy relief again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.424" offset="9827252">There is no court order in the sense that the court says thou shalt do X, Y or Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.328" offset="9854941">The court says that the standards of 1129 have been met and the plan may be confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.732" offset="9880541">And then you go to Section 1141 that says that when a plan has been confirmed, all creditors are bound by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.114" offset="13046060">At any given moment, to the extent the trust fund taxes are due, they are not taken off the hook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.469" offset="13079496">But what is at issue in this case is whether they benefit from a payment that is allocated to the trust fund portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.575" offset="13111888">So, in my hypothetical, if the $60,000 of trust fund taxes out of $100,000 were to be paid over five years, say, then they would benefit as those payments ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.549" offset="13167790">But they would also be subject to IRS attack also as those payments ensue, because it would probably take two to three years for those trust fund taxes to be paid in full.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.210" offset="13334452">My view of what probably should happen is that from the corporate standpoint the taxes should be viewed as still due.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.518" offset="13371650">The government should receive those tax payments, which then gives them in effect a double payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.123" offset="13414073">And then, upon the existence of a double payment, the responsible officer can sue for a refund, thereby keeping the government paid in full and ultimately leaving the responsible officer in the position of a kind of surety, with the debtor primarily paying and the responsible officer secondarily liable.</text>
