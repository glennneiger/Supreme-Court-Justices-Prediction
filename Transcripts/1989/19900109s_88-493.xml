            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87566">The second case is No. 88-493, The University of Pennsylvania against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.439" offset="129257">This case, coming to us from the Third Circuit, concerns academic tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.690" offset="154230">Associate professor Rosalie Tung was denied tenure by the University of Pennsylvania, and she filed a charge with the EEOC alleging discrimination on the basis of race and sex and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.691" offset="226328">In the course of its investigation, the Commission issued a subpoena seeking from the University the professorâ€™s tenure review file and the tenure files of five male faculty members identified as having received more favorable treatment than Tung.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.095" offset="307935">The issue is whether this tenure file material need not be produced in response to the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.378" offset="336983">The EEOC successfully sought enforcement by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.711" offset="358404">The Third Circuit affirmed and rejected claims that policy considerations and First Amendment principles of academic freedom required a qualified privilege or the adaption of balancing approach that would require the Commission to demonstrate some particularized need to obtain peer review materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.587" offset="449832">This obviously is rather a sensitive situation in the halls of academia, but in an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.503" offset="497479">A university does not enjoy a special privilege beyond a showing of mere relevance before peer review materials pertinent to charges of discrimination in tenure decisions are disclosed to the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.751" offset="554531">And this decision, too, is unanimous.</text>
