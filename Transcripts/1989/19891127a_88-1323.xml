            <text>We'll hear arguments first this morning in No. 88-1323, Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services versus Sandra Everhart.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Thank you.</text>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case concerns the validity of longstanding regulations known as the netting regulations that set forth a method for correcting errors in the amount of benefits paid under two Social Security Act programs, the Title II Retirement and Disability Insurance Program, and the Title XVI Supplemental Security Income Program.</text>
            <text>The regulations authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add together or net multiple past errors in the amount of benefits paid to an individual up to the time that the Secretary discovers that an error has been made.</text>
            <text>If that calculation reveals a net underpayment, then under the pertinent statutory provisions, the Secretary pays that amount to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text>If netting reveals a net overpayment, then, before collecting the overpayment from the beneficiary by reducing forthcoming benefits or demanding a refund, the Secretary must consider whether a waiver of recovery is appropriate.</text>
            <text>The Tenth Circuit struck down these regulations as contrary to the provisions of the Social Security Act that they implement.</text>
            <text>This Court should reverse that ruling.</text>
            <text>The netting method has been in use for decades.</text>
            <text>It provides a simple, fair, and common sense way to settle accounts, one that is familiar from a wide variety of contexts.</text>
            <text>Most important, the calculation of the single net error is fully consistent with Congress' intent in creating the payment correction provisions and providing for a waiver of recovery in certain limited circumstances.</text>
            <text>Netting guarantees in every case that the government may never reduce a person's forthcoming benefit payments or demand an out-of-pocket refund without providing an opportunity for a waiver.</text>
            <text>The netting regulation responds to Congress' evident concern to ensure that no one who was without fault in causing the overpayment will be deprived of the resources needed to pay for the basic necessities of life by the Secretary's act of retrieving the overpayment.</text>
            <text>Netting also guarantees that an unfortunate past mistake will not become the occasion for the infliction of future hardship on beneficiaries who are without fault.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Ms. Wax, one of the amicus briefs says that once the Secretary detects an overpayment that it sometimes holds... the government sometimes holds the netting period open and purposely underpays the recipient until it can net out the overpayment in order to take advantage of this netting regulation.</text>
            <text>Do you know of any instances in which that may have occurred?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Your Honor, we are not aware of any instances in which the agency intentionally held open the netting period in order to take advantage of some subsequent underpayment errors that may have occurred.</text>
            <text>There are a few instances mentioned in this litigation where the Secretary has been... perhaps we should say tardy... in taking action on overpayments of which he was aware.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Do you think it would be a violation of the regulations if the Secretary were to do what amicus says is done sometimes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Well, I think it might be... I'm not sure which regulation it would violate for the Secretary to do that because there is no regulation that sets forth a time limit between detection or suspicion of an overpayment and what we call determination of an overpayment.</text>
            <text>But our policy and our practice, which we feel is entitled to a presumption of regularity, is to take no more time than is necessary between the time that the Secretary first becomes aware of an error and actually resolves that error to the point where he's in the position to demand overpayment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But there is no regulation requiring prompt action.</text>
            <text>What recourse would a recipient have faced with this sort of problem?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Your Honor, respectfully, we don't think that a class action that facially challenges the validity of our netting regulation as inconsistent with the statute would be the vehicle in which to challenge what an individual recipient perceives is tardiness, or to the point of arbitrary and capricious tardiness, in resolving their overpayment.</text>
            <text>We think that the proper recourse is an individual lawsuit where the Secretary can defend himself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Ms. Wax, I assume that tardiness, that just waiting, is not a very intelligent policy for the Secretary.</text>
            <text>I mean, he can't use it intentionally to do harm unless he's sure that there will be a future... a future underpayment.</text>
            <text>And presumably it does violate a regulation intentionally to make an underpayment.</text>
            <text>Or, doesn't it?</text>
            <text>Indeed, it violates the statute, does it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Well--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What I am saying is that the Secretary cannot consciously and maliciously use delay because he doesn't know whether he's going to make a future underpayment or not.</text>
            <text>Or, does he?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>--The... well, we think that it would be arbitrary for the Secretary to do that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>To do what?</text>

          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>To deliberately sit on an overpayment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Regardless of whether it would be arbitrary.</text>
            <text>I'm saying whether it's arbitrary or not, it's not very intelligent--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>That's the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--because the Secretary doesn't know that he's going to make a future underpayment and he's just sitting around failing to collect the overpayment on the speculation that there will be a future underpayment, unless you assume that he can consciously make a future underpayment in order to work the system.</text>
            <text>He can't do that, can he?</text>
            <text>Well, of course, that's... that's exactly the allegation that's made by amicus.</text>
            <text>Precisely that.</text>
            <text>Well, then your answer to that is that there is a law against his making future underpayments.</text>
            <text>Is there not or is there not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>--There is a law against his making future underpayments deliberately, yes.</text>
            <text>That would violate the provisions of the statute that set the substantive level.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>He violates the law if he does it negligently.</text>
            <text>He has to make up the underpayment.</text>
            <text>He's violated the statute.</text>
            <text>He owes somebody something.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
            <text>To the extent that the statute says that whenever he determines that an error has been made, then he shall make it up.</text>
            <text>And to the extent that that would imply the duty to make it up in a timely fashion and not to use it to manipulate the situation, we agree.</text>
            <text>But Justice Scalia's point is well worth noting.</text>
            <text>The Secretary... it would be a very inefficient way to collect underpayments to sort of sit around waiting for overpayment... oh, excuse me, for underpayments to accrue that he can put together with those overpayments.</text>
            <text>The fact is that most people do pay back their overpayments.</text>
            <text>The vast majority of overpayments can be collected by the Secretary in a fairly prompt manner.</text>
            <text>So it would not be in the Secretary's interest to delay processing those overpayments on the speculation that underpayments might crop up later that he could net with them.</text>
            <text>And we make that point in our reply brief.</text>
            <text>We just... we have no incentive.</text>
            <text>The incentive structure would not lead us to do that and we don't do that.</text>
            <text>This case is controlled by the principles set forth in Chevron v. NRDC.</text>
            <text>The netting regulations deserve substantial deference and should be upheld unless they are arbitrary, capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute.</text>
            <text>Respondents contend, as they must to prevail in this case, that the regulations cannot possibly be reconciled with the payment correction provisions.</text>
            <text>But, in fact, the very opposite is true.</text>
            <text>The language and history of these provisions and their evolution reveal a clear congressional intent to permit the aggregation of past errors rather than just the consideration of each monthly error in isolation and to mandate a waiver procedure only in the case where the Secretary attempts prospective means of recovery... that is, the reduction in forthcoming benefits or the demand for a refund.</text>
            <text>In challenging the netting practice, respondents focus on the waiver of recovery provision, which places limits on the Secretary's authority to collect overpayments.</text>
            <text>The Title II waiver provision provides that there shall be no adjustment or recovery from any person who is without fault where such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of the statute or would be against equity and good conscience.</text>
            <text>In a nutshell, respondents claim that netting, which necessarily entails the setting off of overpayment errors in some past months against underpayment errors in other past months, is a form of adjustment or recovery within the meaning of the waiver provision.</text>
            <text>Therefore, they contend, the Secretary must consider waiver before netting, and the Secretary must decide whether to waive the total amount of overpayments considered separate and apart from any underpayments that may have occurred before netting them together.</text>
            <text>And, under this Court's decision in Califano v. Yamasaki, that means a face-to-face hearing.</text>
            <text>But the statutory language and history reveal that the terms adjustment and recovery were never intended to refer to retroactive setoffs but, rather, to prospective recruitment methods.</text>
            <text>That is, the reduction in forthcoming benefits or an out-of-pocket refund.</text>
            <text>And the waiver provisions were intended to provide procedural protections in just the cases where the Secretary attempts to use those methods to retrieve the money that's mistakenly paid out.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>If "adjustment" and "recovery" in the statute don't include netting, then where does the Secretary get his authority for the netting regulation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Well, there are two sources of authority for netting, that is, setting off past overpayments and underpayments.</text>
            <text>The first is what we call the determination clause or the determination provision of the payment correction provisions.</text>
            <text>The statute says that whenever the Secretary determines that more or less than the correct amount of payment has been made or benefits have been paid, then under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, he shall make adjustment or recovery.</text>
            <text>And we interpret the "authority" to determine whether more or less than the correct amount of payment has been made as implicitly delegating to the Secretary the prerogative to decide over what past period he shall determine whether more or less has been paid.</text>
            <text>And that includes the authority to decide whether more or less has been paid up to the point when he makes the determination... that is, over the entire past period.</text>
            <text>Second, there is a common-law right of administrative or equitable setoff which this Court has recognized in numerous cases, cases that are cited in our reply brief, including Gratiot versus United States, Burchard versus United States, Wisconsin Central Railroad, and a long line of cases in which this Court has said that the government may apply assets belonging to the debtor that are in its hands against debts owed to the government.</text>
            <text>It need not pay out those amounts and then attempt to get them back.</text>
            <text>We construe that as a sort of background authority to do a setoff in any type... an authority that needs to be--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yes, but... may I just interrupt you.</text>
            <text>Do you think that common-law authority survives the statutory provision that no adjustment shall be made without providing for the... you know, of an overpayment unless you have the opportunity to forgive part of it?</text>
            <text>How does the common-law survive that statutory enactment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>--Well, we think it survives for two reasons.</text>
            <text>First of all, as this Court has noted in the cases I've just mentioned, because there is such a strong presumption that the government can do common-law setoff, there needs to be a very explicit congressional expression of intent to limit that right or cut it off.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What could be more explicit than no adjustment shall be made if it would defeat the purpose of the subchapter and so forth?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Well, we think that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That's pretty explicit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>--when those terms are looked at in their statutory context, that they do not have the expansive meaning... that is, the meaning that encompasses retroactive setoff... they have a narrower meaning.</text>
            <text>We don't think that those terms have a plain meaning and we think that if we look at the 1935 statute, the '39 statute, the way that these provisions have evolved, it becomes clear that Congress never intended those terms to refer to retroactive setoffs.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, let me just ask then, is it your position that at the time an underpayment is made and it's identified, the government can always look back as far as it can to see whether there is any past overpayment and always set it off regardless of whether equity or good conscience would justify it?</text>
            <text>They could do it deliberately in every case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>That is correct, your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yeah.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>The Secretary is allowed to look backward from... not from the time that the underpayment was made, but from the time when he determines--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Right, I understand.</text>

          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>--that the underpayment is made.</text>
            <text>Yes.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And to follow-up on Justice Steven's question, in your view, that would never result in a recoupment that was against equity or good conscience?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Let's put this way--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, can we put it my way?</text>
            <text>[Laughter]</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>--We think that the Secretary is entitled to decide... to come up with a threshold criterion to decide when the equity in good conscience inquiry should take place.</text>
            <text>Just to be more concrete about that, if an individual has in their past payment record an underpayment and a counterbalancing overpayment, they are in a very different position from someone who just has a pure overpayment because the person who has both kinds of errors can always satisfy his debt to the government by extinguishing the government's debt to him.</text>
            <text>He can do it with essentially a paper transaction.</text>
            <text>Whereas, the person who has a pure overpayment cannot do it with a paper transaction.</text>
            <text>He has to either risk his present and future benefits, suffer a garnishment of those benefits, or he has to reach into his pocket and transfer cash to the government.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, again, I think the respondent is correct in saying that you basically have a per se rule that netting can never result in a recoupment that's against equity or good conscience.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Well, as a general matter it's more likely that the obligation to repay a net overpayment will be inequitable--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, but the whole scheme of the statute is that we don't look at it as a general matter.</text>
            <text>We look at it on a case-by-case basis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>--Well, this Court has said in cases such as Bowen v. Yuckert and Heckler v. Campbell that even where a statute requires an individualized determination that the Secretary can make threshold rules which weed out individuals that in his judgment generally will not meet the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text>And the Secretary has a lot of discretion to decide when recovery would be inequitable.</text>
            <text>Those are broad terms that the Secretary necessarily must give content to.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But you've given content to them in this case by a per se rule that there can never be a recoupment that's against equity or good conscience whenever there is netting.</text>

            <text>Yes, essentially we have because we have made a reasonable distinction, which we believe is reasonable, between individuals who have mixed errors and can satisfy their debt simply by erasing two numbers on two sides of a ledger and individuals who have to suffer some deprivation in the present to pay back the money.</text>
            <text>We think that that is the sort of distinction that the Secretary is entitled to make in implementing this statute and in giving content to the terms "equity" and "good conscience" which are very broad general terms in light of the overall purpose of the statute.</text>

            <text>I don't understand the government's position.</text>
            <text>I thought the government was saying that it is only required to consider equity and good conscience by the statute after the netting.</text>
            <text>Now you are saying... which seems to me quite different and a proposition I find quite difficult to grasp... that that's not it.</text>
            <text>But, rather, what the government says is that there is no violation of equity and good conscience so long as you're netting.</text>
            <text>In other words, the statutory provision governs but you are just adopting a general rule that will comply with the statutory provision.</text>

            <text>We're saying that Congress was quite clear.</text>
            <text>We feel that Congress wrote a statute that was very clear in which it set a floor that we only need to consider fault equity and the purposes of the statute after we finish netting.</text>

            <text>I think it's a very hard burden to bear if the Secretary is trying to persuade us that this will never result in a situation that's going to impose something of a hardship on the person who has to have the setoff.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Well, your Honor, as you've said, we don't get to the hardship determination until we finish netting.</text>
            <text>So, that partly solves the problem.</text>
            <text>But in terms of an individual who has been underpaid perhaps getting themselves into a very bad situation which simple reimbursement of the amount might not compensate for... if a person has a pure underpayment error, there is no provision in the statute for overcompensation of that person.</text>
            <text>That person may go into debt, they may incur expenses because they weren't paid timely and yet the statute simply provides that they will get back the amount that they're entitled to... not that they will be deliberately paid more than they're entitled to, which is what would happen if there was a waiver of an underpayment... excuse me... an overpayment considered separately.</text>
            <text>So, in that sense, we think that it's fair and it comports--</text>

            <text>That scenario that you described doesn't come up all that often.</text>
            <text>But the fact remains that even in that situation the person has gotten the money they're entitled to and, when they have to repay the government, they can do it by applying the underpayment to their overpayment; they don't have to pay out of pocket.</text>

            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>At issue in this case is an analysis of the waiver statute, 42 U.S.C. Section 404(b), and the manner in which the Secretary's netting policy abrogates the equitable protections provided by that statute.</text>
            <text>Today I would like to focus on these three main issues: the plain language and intent of the waiver statute, the fact that netting is a form of adjustment in recovery and therefore specifically limited by the waiver statute, and the fact that the enforcement of the lower court's order would not be unduly burdensome.</text>
            <text>The waiver statute language is clear, unambiguous and mandatory.</text>
            <text>It states that in any overpayment case there shall be no adjustment or recovery from any blameless person if such recovery would cause hardship or inequity.</text>
            <text>This broad language protects any overpaid person.</text>
            <text>It does not exclude overpaid people with underpayments.</text>

            <text>That has been determined to mean would deprive a person of income needed for ordinary and necessary living expenses.</text>
            <text>And that would be the hardship aspect of waiver.</text>
            <text>You have to prove both, that the overpayment was not your fault and either that it would defeat the purposes of the Act to collect it, which means cause a financial hardship, or that it would be inequitable to collect it.</text>

            <text>By... by this Court and by the legislature in its legislative history... has indicated that it was to protect people from any sort of burdensome collection activity.</text>
            <text>When Congress enacted the waiver provision in 1939, Congress was aware that there would be erroneous payments by the Secretary and sought to protect, in limited circumstances, individuals from recovery where such recovery would cause great financial hardship.</text>
            <text>There is no evidence that Congress has ever sought to cut back on this broad equitable protection.</text>

          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>--Well, the SSI regulations of the Title XVI regulation has been in effect since 1975.</text>
            <text>The Secretary's brief indicates that it was going on in Title II sometime before then but we really don't know.</text>
            <text>The only clear time for this Title II regulation is in 1981 when the ruling was enacted.</text>
            <text>The Yamasaki case of 1979 clearly set out the fact that Congress in the plain language of the statute found that waiver should precede any sort of recovery, a waiver consideration.</text>
            <text>It was a similar attempt by the Secretary to infringe on a beneficiary's entitlement to seek waiver of recovery.</text>
            <text>And this Court found that recovery could not precede a waiver notice and hearing.</text>
            <text>It's that very notice and hearing which the respondents' are seeking prior to any recovery through netting.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Was the Court in Yamasaki dealing with this situation where you're talking about a setoff of previously received benefits?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>The Court did not specifically address netting, although there is some indication that the named plaintiff was a netting victim.</text>
            <text>But Yamasaki is applicable in that it did deal with a recovery prior to the institution of waiver rights.</text>
            <text>It is our position that netting is a recovery and the plain language of 42 U.S.C. Section 404(a) which describes the collection procedures supports our position.</text>
            <text>The Secretary has in fact conceded that if netting is an adjustment or recovery, he must provide waiver rights.</text>
            <text>404(a) provides--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Where has he conceded that?</text>
            <text>Because I interpreted the argument this morning to contradict that.</text>
            <text>There was an alternative argument made.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>--Well, in page 22 of the brief in chief is where he makes that concession.</text>
            <text>The plain language of 404(a)(1) provides whenever the Secretary finds that more or less than the correct amount of payment has been made to any person, proper adjustment or recovery shall be made under regulations prescribed.</text>
            <text>Again, this broad language is used which says whenever the Secretary finds an incorrect payment and, furthermore, the words "adjustment and recovery" are broad terms which cover a variety of collection attempts which we would argue includes the netting procedure.</text>
            <text>The adjective "proper" further indicates that collection only from individuals not eligible for waiver is allowed.</text>
            <text>Again, this Court in the Yamasaki decision, indicated that the implication of that word is that recoupment from persons qualifying for waiver would not be proper.</text>
            <text>And it's just such an improper recovery we contend that's at issue in this case.</text>
            <text>The broad connotations of the words adjustment and recovery have been outlined in the brief and certainly should be interpreted to include netting.</text>
            <text>Some of the cases cited by--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, Ms. Olson, I guess the government takes the position that the statutory language that directs the Secretary to find whether more or less than the correct amount of payment was made is sufficiently general that it permits the Secretary to determine whether there has been a net overpayment or a net underpayment.</text>
            <text>So, you don't get to the question of adjustment or recovery until that step has been taken.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>--Yes, that is the Secretary's position, but there is no... there is no definition of the term "more or less" in the statute that would support such.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, do you think then that some deference to the Secretary's definition is owing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>Not where the Secretary's definition directly contradicts the succeeding paragraph which just says that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, it doesn't contradict it if... if their reasoning is correct on their definition of determining whether more or less than the correct amount has been paid.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>--Well, our reading of more or less would mean either that the statute is supposed to be distinguishing between overpayments, which would be more, or underpayments, which would be less.</text>
            <text>And that differential treatment appears throughout this statute and it was one of the things that the Tenth Circuit relied on in striking down the statute.</text>
            <text>That all Congress intended with that language was to say that if the Secretary finds that more than the correct amount of payment has been made, look to waiver, if less than the correct amount has been paid, pay the underpayment.</text>
            <text>Another way of looking at more or less would be to say that the Secretary makes a monthly determination of the correct amount of payment and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, there is nothing in the statute that says it has to be done monthly, is there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>--Well, there are other provisions in the statute which refer to payments being made monthly, that the calculation of the correct amount of payment is determined on a monthly basis.</text>
            <text>42 U.S.C. 402 and 423 both indicate that Title II is a monthly program, and 42 U.S.C. 1382(c)(1) also highlights the fact that SSI is a monthly program.</text>
            <text>The reality is that that's how the Secretary conducts business.</text>
            <text>That's how the Secretary does netting, is to first find out what the correct amount of payment is for the month.</text>
            <text>After that, he proceeds to the second step, which is netting.</text>
            <text>It's incorrect to argue that netting precedes that step because netting can't occur until first a monthly determination of error has been made and the amounts have been set off.</text>

            <text>When adjustment and recovery appear in both sections, it seems clear that the Secretary was limited specifically in any type of adjustment procedure.</text>
            <text>The Secretary himself, in his own regulations, uses the words adjustment and recovery very broadly and uses them to refer to lump sum offsets.</text>
            <text>Those are adjustments.</text>
            <text>Increases in monthly benefits are adjustments.</text>
            <text>His policy operations manual even describes the netting procedure as an adjustment.</text>
            <text>There is a great deal of inconsistency with that position and then to claim that it's not mandated to be limited under the waiver statute.</text>

            <text>There is really no reason why there should be this distinction between different period and same period netting, and we would submit that in all netting situations both Title II and Title XVI, a recipient should have the right to prove hardship.</text>
            <text>The actual effect on the individual of the netting procedure is that it does create hardships for some individuals when the waiver statute is designed to prevent such inequity.</text>
            <text>There is no question that when the Secretary netted Mr. Zweizen's $4,000 underpayment against his $9,000 overpayment that the Secretary recovered $4,000.</text>
            <text>Mr. Zweizen has $4,000 less to meet his obligations.</text>
            <text>He may be facing foreclosure; he may have $10,000 in medical bills.</text>
            <text>He will never have an opportunity to prove his need for this underpayment, however, under the Secretary's netting system.</text>
            <text>All the respondents are arguing is that Mr. Zweizen should have that opportunity to prove why such recovery is inequitable.</text>

            <text>Although the Secretary would argue that it's a rare occurrence that there are long netting periods, the facts of the named plaintiffs and some of the individuals named in the amicus brief belie that contention.</text>
            <text>In fact, two of the named plaintiffs had seven-year netting periods.</text>
            <text>Mr. Zenick had a five-year netting period.</text>
            <text>Certainly if there is a very short netting period, if, as Justice White indicated, there's a few months involved, it's less likely that one could establish the inequitability of returning the money.</text>
            <text>It's more likely that the overpayment is around or that the overpayment amount is relatively small.</text>
            <text>But in lengthy netting periods, it's clear that the overpayment has long since been spent.</text>

            <text>Well, I think that the language of the statute lends itself to the presumption that you can go back many years.</text>
            <text>As Judge Gibbons found in the Lugo dissent, you could go... the Secretary could go back a quarter of a century and collect overpayments through netting.</text>

            <text>Yes, but might not the proper relief there be to something more determinative to that particular situation rather than just striking down a regulation which might only rarely reach that situation?</text>

            <text>In our experience, we have seen many individuals come in with long periods such as this.</text>
            <text>The reality is, when the Secretary terminates someone's benefits, the Secretary knows that person has been overpaid.</text>
            <text>A notice could go out that day, the same day as the termination notice.</text>
            <text>But, for some reason, in situations such as Mr. Zenick, no overpayment notice goes out until years later when he's due a large underpayment.</text>
            <text>There is no disincentive for such a lengthy netting period at this point, and that's one of our concerns.</text>

            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>The Secretary's... the Secretary's position shows that we would argue as a patent disregard for some of the desperate financial straits in which some disabled and elderly people find themselves.</text>
            <text>By presuming that an individual who is owed an underpayment has no need for his funds if he also has an overpayment, the Secretary does a great disservice to many individuals who do have obligations to meet.</text>
            <text>If they have a large medical bill and the Secretary has netted their overpayment so that they cannot pay it with their underpayment, individuals will reduce their monthly income to make those payments.</text>
            <text>So, contrary to the Secretary's representations, there will be a reduction in one's standard of living.</text>
            <text>There will be economic insecurity because those debts which could have been paid with the underpayment will now be paid with their limited monthly income.</text>
            <text>Congress did not intend such a result when it enacted the 404(a) and 404(b).</text>
            <text>The Lugo court, which contradicts the Tenth Circuit's decision, made a number of misassumptions.</text>
            <text>It indicated that it was somewhat troubled by the scenario of an individual like Mr. Lugo who had a large netting period, but presumed that it didn't affect a lot of people.</text>
            <text>There was no data cited for why it made this presumption.</text>
            <text>The Lugo majority wrongly considered waivers to be windfalls when in fact the waiver protection is specifically designed to protect the most needy and the most vulnerable.</text>
            <text>It is not a windfall.</text>
            <text>It misapplied the Yamasaki decision.</text>
            <text>Yamasaki made a limited exception in the case of reconsideration decisions.</text>
            <text>If someone is just disputing the amount of an overpayment, they do not need to have a prerecoupment notice and hearing.</text>
            <text>That is not the case in the netting situation.</text>
            <text>What is at issue in netting is the waiver protection.</text>
            <text>Furthermore, the Lugo majority improperly relied on the Secretary's claim that if netting is eliminated, a multitude of confusing notices and monthly hearings would be required.</text>
            <text>The Tenth Circuit properly held that it would not be administratively burdensome to eliminate the existing netting policy.</text>
            <text>The Tenth Circuit found the Secretary would be under no greater burden to provide notice in hearings than already imposed under the statue in Yamasaki.</text>
            <text>There is no requirement of monthly notices or monthly hearings.</text>
            <text>Many of the provisions that the Tenth Circuit would require are already in place.</text>
            <text>The Secretary has a regulation, 20 C.F.R. 416.558, which provides for notices which break down the overpayment and underpayment for each month.</text>
            <text>That is all that we would need as well as a pre-netting waiver procedure which is found at 20 C.F.R. 416.543.</text>

            <text>The essence of an equitable statute such as the waiver statute is the individual determination, the individual opportunity to prove hardship.</text>

            <text>No, but I am allowing him to prove hardship.</text>
            <text>The Secretary conducts the netting just the way he does now, only he allows the individual to come in and say even though you're setting off and even though I don't have to reach in my pocket, there is still hardship in my particular case.</text>
            <text>Why wouldn't that satisfy all of your objections?</text>

          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">

            <text>When it said there shall be no recovery from blameless people, it meant there shall be no recovery through netting or any other sort of adjustment, and this is just that sort of recovery.</text>
            <text>The Secretary acknowledges that only six percent of overpaid people ever even request waiver.</text>

            <text>He would have an opportunity to present testimony about that, his credibility could be assessed in the way the statute intended then before collection could take place.</text>
            <text>It's possible to get a partial waiver.</text>
            <text>It's possible that one could go through that hearing and the administrative law judge could determine you're entitled to waiver of the balance of the overpayment but for the amount that would be covered by the underpayment, the Secretary can keep it.</text>

            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>Yeah.</text>
            <text>I must have misunderstood.</text>
            <text>I was thinking if it was months.</text>
            <text>I mean, if we were talking of six or ten months of holding an... recovering an underpayment that way, that wouldn't be proper.</text>
            <text>But there is not a requirement that would immediately demand reimbursement of the underpayments if the overpayment were determined at the same time.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Why not ten months?</text>
            <text>I don't understand.</text>
            <text>Once you accept that, it seems to me you say that the Secretary can use this netting procedure so long as he gives you a hearing or some kind of a process to determine that the offset isn't going to impose hardship.</text>
            <text>That's really all you're asking for, but you're insisting that it be done promptly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>Well, we certainly don't want to aggravate the hardship or the inequity by a system that would demand that an underpayment be withheld for a great length of time.</text>
            <text>The problem now is the Secretary fails to make prompt waiver determinations.</text>
            <text>Some of the people in the amicus brief have waited years for a waiver determination.</text>
            <text>So, that would not be a good resolution to the problem.</text>
            <text>But a prompt waiver determination could... could resolve our concerns.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>The Secretary takes the position, as I understand it, that you never get to the waiver problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linda_j_olson">
            <label>Ms. Linda J. Olson</label>
            <text>That's right.</text>
            <text>That's the Secretary's position.</text>
            <text>You only get to waiver if you have a net overpayment.</text>
            <text>But everything in the statute, as we read it and as Congress intended, contradicts that presumption.</text>
            <text>As the Tenth Circuit held, the fundamental flaw in the Secretary's reasoning is that through netting he is effectively recovering benefits and such recovery, in the absence of a waiver determination, violates the plain language of the statute and Yamasaki.</text>
            <text>We respectfully request this Court to affirm the Tenth Circuit's decision.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Justice Scalia suggests, why not just go ahead and net and then give the person the opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text>Once again, we don't think the statute requires that.</text>
            <text>But also, we want to emphasize that that would place a significant new burden on the agency because as things stand now, one-half of all individuals with mixed payment errors end up with net underpayments.</text>
            <text>Those individuals' accounts can be resolved very promptly just by sending out a check.</text>
            <text>And, if everyone in the mixed group now becomes entitled to a hearing, that will swamp the system with multiple new hearing obligations that will--</text>

            <text>Except for this.</text>
            <text>That in each of those cases the person had the burden of proving that it would be inequitable even if the person kept the amount in dispute.</text>
            <text>As you said earlier, most of the time it's going to work out fairly if they keep the amount in dispute.</text>
            <text>So, the burden is really higher for a person who has that cash on the table and, say, the government can't keep that cash.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But your argument earlier about why this was basically fair, we really assume that to be the case in the typical case.</text>

          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>--Well, we have no reason to believe that people won't request waiver with the same frequency in that population... request waiver if they're separate overpayments in the same frequency as they now request waiver of their net overpayments.</text>
            <text>We have no way of knowing.</text>
            <text>All we know is that there will be many, many more requests for waiver, the vast majority of which will virtually be non-meritorious, thereby delaying our processing of the meritorious net overpayment waiver claims, placing a significant new administrative burden on the agency.</text>
            <text>And that's what we're worried about.</text>
            <text>That's why we're here today.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Do the waiver applications or hearings... are they conducted before an administrative law judge?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Initially, they are conducted before a program officer.</text>
            <text>They are an informal face-to-face hearing before a program officer.</text>
            <text>But, of course, all appeal rights are reserved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So, either... a party that is dissatisfied with the determination of the program officer can appeal to an administrative law judge?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>There can be appeal to the administrative law judge, to the appeals council, to the district court.</text>
            <text>The resolution of mixed errors can be delayed indefinitely by this new waiver right.</text>
            <text>That's why we're very concerned about it.</text>
            <text>Secondly, it's true that in some of the cases of the named plaintiffs and intervenors, the period over which overpayments and underpayments were netted was fairly extensive, five or six years.</text>
            <text>But that does not mean that these named plaintiffs conformed to Justice Steven's scenario.</text>
            <text>Ms. Wise and Mr. Zwiezen had overpayments and underpayments from overlapping periods.</text>
            <text>They actually had overpayments and underpayments in the same month.</text>
            <text>It would be preposterous, we submit, to waive the overpayment component and Othen turn around and pay them the underpayment component when they have both errors in the same month.</text>
            <text>For example, Ms. Wise was overpaid disability benefits because she was working, but she was underpaid retirement benefits that she was entitled to but did not collect.</text>
            <text>Justice Steven's scenario is fairly rare.</text>
            <text>It's a very remote overpayment, a widely separated interval, and then an underpayment.</text>
            <text>And that is not the scenario presented by any of the individuals who are named in this case.</text>
            <text>Finally, just to clarify, it is the Secretary's regulations that interpret the concepts of fault, equity and good conscience and defeat the purpose, and those regulations are cited in respondent's brief at note 4.</text>
            <text>If the Court has no further questions, we'll conclude our remarks.</text>
