            <text syncTime="112.339" offset="594688">They bring the individual into the room, ask him some routine booking questions, his name, his address, his Social Security number and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.862" offset="632827">They then follow that with several sobriety tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.997" offset="645366">They first at this point ask him to try to calculate the date of his sixth birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.217" offset="666159">They ask him to walk a line, nine steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.753" offset="680370">They ask him to balance himself on one leg while counting to 30, and they conduct the horizontal gaze nystagmus test which measures the effect of alcohol on the function of the eye.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.268" offset="12138407">Now the FBI took Mr. Hinckley in for about 20 or 25 minutes, asked him questions concerning where his parents lived, his address, did he have girlfriends, where did he work, how far had he gone in school, those sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.611" offset="12199743">It was nothing even as overt as this case, because it didn't have directly to do with the elements of the offense that he was charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.598" offset="12223671">But the court found that since the agents were aware that there was a likelihood that there would be an insanity defense, the responses were inadmissible, because it was reasonably likely to... or the... the FBI was aware that there questions were reasonably likely to lead to an incriminating response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.659" offset="12299949">And that's the... exactly the situation in this case, or it's pretty close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.130" offset="12317816">Because you have the officer at roadside who has testified that he observes odor of alcohol, bloodshot eyes, poor coordination, trouble producing license and registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.288" offset="12366509">In fact, he told him to stay at the side of the road until he sobered up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.240" offset="12382286">According to the officer, practically every contact at the side of the road produced some sort of an incriminating response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.412" offset="12406946">And from that point on, law enforcement certainly should have known that... that whatever they asked Mr. Muniz was likely to illicit an incriminating response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.582" offset="12439651">And then, more of the same at the booking center.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.684" offset="12448115">He... he can't even give them his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.386" offset="12454907">He has to look at his wallet.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.123" offset="12481865">Is it reasonably likely to expect that a... that a drunk driving suspect on being asked to perform these field sobriety tests, when he can't do them, will provide some sort of an explanation which will end up being incriminating?</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.348" offset="12534737">If the procedure in this case is not construed by this Court to be interrogation, I would argue that the privilege against self-incrimination would be substantially eroded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.671" offset="12579981">You can't expect a defendant who is upset by the arrest itself, without counsel, he does not know of his right not to have the conversation, to make a choice based on the consequences of these seemingly innocent questions and instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.748" offset="12632331">Because the questions, on their face, to the defendant, are... are statistical, and may be... may seem to him to be to ensure he understood, without being told that he has a right to remain silent, or that whatever he says might be used against him, he has no way to know that he doesn't have to answer and that his responses may be used later at trial to convict him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.995" offset="13345264">They're within... across the river is Cumberland County from Dauphin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.066" offset="13361565">Lastly, the advantage of Miranda has always been its clarity... it's bright line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.201" offset="13382149">The police, the prosecutors, the lower courts, know what must be done for questioning and under what circumstances statements are admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.473" offset="13419243">If you make an exception to the facts for this case, it's going to lead to a lot of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.210" offset="13438156">The end result would be an elaborate set of rules and exceptions and distinctions, and nobody... not the police, not the prosecutors, not the courts... are going to know with any certainty as to any particular situation whether or not the interrogation is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.453" offset="13495103">If you allow the kind of conduct or questioning or the process that occurred here, you put a premium on the police devising these indirect interrogation methods, these tricky things of the sixth birthday question and other similar indirect questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.514" offset="13571380">Because the... what happened at the booking center is actually... if... it actually incriminated and was just as deadly to Mr. Muniz as if he'd have been asked, "are you drunk", if for all intents and purposes his responses said, "I am drunk".</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.810" offset="13636582">And I would argue that because the utterances disclosed the contents of his mind, his reasoning ability, that they were testimonial and protected by the Fifth Amendment, and since he was subject to interrogation without Miranda warnings, that the audio portion of the videotape was correctly ruled inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.220" offset="13698231">If there are no other questions, I'll sit down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.989" offset="13725294">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.825" offset="13728638">I would suggest that what the Court's being asked to do by Mr. Maffett is to extend Miranda to cover situations of custodial sobriety testing that it's not designed for, and that instead of the contrary, trying to devise a set of rights that an intoxicated suspect will understand that tells him he has a right to remain silent except you've got to do these tests, would be completely unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.143" offset="13833859">Because the tests are designed to get physical, demonstrative evidence and that's all they're designed to get, I suggest that the present law covers that and covers it quite clearly, and Miranda warnings should not be extended to apply to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.068" offset="13893627">Unless the Court has other questions, I'll forego the rest of my time.</text>
