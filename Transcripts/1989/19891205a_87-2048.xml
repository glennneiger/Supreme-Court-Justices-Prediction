            <text syncTime="9.366" offset="185387">Mr. Fishbein.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter M. Fishbein</label>
            <text syncTime="17.972" offset="219764">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.746" offset="230945">The Ninth Circuit below held Texaco liable for violation of 2A of the Robinson-Patman Act for engaging in an age-old practice, indeed one which is economically necessary, of selling to wholesalers at a lower price than it sold to retailers on the condition... on two conditions:</text>
            <text syncTime="43.342" offset="321329">One, that the wholesale discount was not calibrated just to meet the wholesaler's cost of wholesaling; and--</text>
            <text syncTime="52.288" offset="357064">Two, that the wholesaler, who was an independent business entity, made an independent decision to pass some of that discount on to its retailers; i.e., it sold its retailers at a price that was different from Texaco's direct sale to its retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.840" offset="423311">The plaintiffs who recovered damages for this are 12 retail service stations in Spokane, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.137" offset="460509">They were awarded treble damages during a period January 1972 through April 1981, based on Texaco's sales to Dompier Oil Company, a wholesaler, at a higher price than it sold directly to the Plaintiff retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.179" offset="532607">The record shows that Dompier purchased gasoline from Texaco at the standard wholesale discount off the retail tank wagon price that Texaco gave to all its wholesalers in the Washington and Oregon territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.303" offset="613169">Well, the record indicates that there were two wholesalers in Spokane and a substantial number throughout the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.231" offset="716822">And both of them also sold at retail, didn't they?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Peter M. Fishbein</label>
            <text syncTime="144.194" offset="724659">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.883" offset="731451">Dompier, which is the wholesaler at issue here, during part of the period of damages, sold only at wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.010" offset="767918">During part of the period and a later period it sold both at wholesale and at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.295" offset="789129">Your Honor, the way the damages were advanced by the plaintiffs here is they took four retail stations in Spokane, and the damages were based exclusively on the effect of the consumer sales from these four stations as they affected the plaintiff stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.607" offset="874393">Those four were all Dompier-supplied stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.460" offset="889753">The record is clear that during the beginning of the damage period, from January 1972 through July '74, each of those four stations was an independent retailer, had no direct relationship with Dompier, and Dompier bought and then made an independent price decision to sell to those four retail stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.355" offset="977316">They, in turn, made an independent price decision as to what price to charge the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.520" offset="998004">So that for part of the damage period, Dompier acted exclusively as a wholesaler and not a retailer, and the only damages claimed by plaintiffs for that part of the damage period were the sales from Dompier to these four stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.480" offset="1065818">That is why the district court, in footnote 4 of its opinion, specifically said prior to 1974 Dompier Oil Company did not operate any retail stations but as a distributor sold Texaco gasoline to retail stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.824" offset="1135200">Now, Your Honor--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="248.704" offset="1142723">Would... would you concede liability for the time when Dompier was acting as a retailer?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.508" offset="1165920">--No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.990" offset="1171876">The issue for the time when Dompier was acting as a... both a wholesaler and a retailer is an issue that's been much debated within the Federal Trade Commission and the courts of appeals which has been recently discussed in Judge Starr's opinion in Boise Cascade.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.731" offset="1242824">It goes back to the FTC's opinions in Doubleday and Mueller, and it's a question of when... when an entity is performing both functions, what kind of a discount or what kind of a lower price can the supplier give?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.481" offset="1301861">Does it have to cover only the retail functions?</text>
            <text syncTime="291.535" offset="1314086">Can it... can it give the wholesale discount for all sales even though some of them are on retail?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.310" offset="1341149">That's an issue that is being much debated in the lower courts and the Trade Commission now which would have to be resolved as to the period subsequent to 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.717" offset="1386811">But that issue is not before this Court because that wasn't addressed in the Ninth Circuit opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.732" offset="1406873">That would have to be an issue that the lower courts would have to deal with on remand if the Ninth Circuit decision is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.736" offset="1438847">The issue that the Ninth Circuit opinion presents to this Court, because that's the way the case was tried and that's the way the record that clearly is the part of the damage period is directly assailed to an entity Dompier is exclusively a wholesaler and makes an independent decision to sell to its retailers at a certain price.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.042" offset="1528081">That is the issue before the Court, and that's the issue we suggest the Ninth Circuit departed from logic and economics and precedent when it said that alone is sufficient to create a liability under Section 2A.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="358.940" offset="1583670">Mr. Fishbein, I think I understand that the jury was given an instruction at trial, number 20, which told the jury that it could infer the likelihood of injury to competition from evidence that Texaco had discriminated in price in the sale of gasoline between different purchasers who were in competition with each other and that the price difference was substantial and it lasted for a substantial period of time, the so-called Morton Salt type instruction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_m_fishbein" startTime="396.507" stopTime="396.707">
            <label>Mr. Peter M. Fishbein</label>
            <text syncTime="396.507" offset="1733926">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="396.707" stopTime="401.941">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="396.707" offset="1734762">You may... your client did not object to that instruction, I take it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_m_fishbein" startTime="401.941" stopTime="541.489">
            <label>Mr. Peter M. Fishbein</label>
            <text syncTime="401.941" offset="1755660">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.392" offset="1757541">That's the standard Morton Salt instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.325" offset="1765273">What my client did object to, Your Honor, was instruction 23(A) which converted the Morton Salt inference as it was enunciated by this Court in Morton Salt into a very different inference because instruction 23(A) told the jury that Dompier, in effect, would be in competition with the plaintiffs if any of Dompier's customers were in competition with the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.867" offset="1887422">So when you take instruction 20 and 23(A) together, what the jury was instructed is that the discriminatory price, the price difference between Dompier as a wholesaler and the plaintiffs as a retailer itself and alone would justify the Morton Salt inference because Dompier's customers, not Dompier, was in competition with the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.126" offset="1992434">Now it's our position... and, of course, the Ninth Circuit dealt with the Morton Salt inference rather extensively in its opinion, and it's our position, Your Honor, that that is a misapplication of the Morton Salt inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.566" offset="2050217">In effect, what that does is convert a traditional time-honored, economically required policy of selling to a wholesaler at a lower price than a retailer into an automatic inference that that in itself effects competition at the retail level, whereas Morton Salt, of course, was a sale by a seller to two competing buyers who were competing with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.584" offset="2158259">Now it's one thing to say that it's self-evident that if over a substantial period of time a seller is selling to two competing buyers at substantially different prices that that is going to affect the competition between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.184" offset="2212698">It's wholly different, as the Ninth Circuit did in this case, and as the jury instructions required the jury to do, to say that when a wholesaler... when a retailer, a supplier sells to a wholesaler at one price and a retailer at a lower price, that that in itself said that it self-evidently is going to affect competition between the wholesalers, retailers and the direct buying retail.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="541.489" offset="2313844">Mr. Fishbein, the Robinson-Patman Act does prohibit discrimination in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.569" offset="2358253">Now what was it about this case that prevented that language from applying to your client?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter M. Fishbein</label>
            <text syncTime="558.844" offset="2383330">There are two parts of the Robinson-Patman Act language that don't apply in this instance, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.729" offset="2418857">One is, as you pointed out, it has to be the person, i.e. Texaco, has to discriminate in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.415" offset="2449577">It's our position that this is not a discrimination because, when you charge different prices to people at different levels of the distribution chain, that is not a discrimination within the meaning of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.817" offset="2515196">Our second argument--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="593.409" offset="2521570">Well, you... you think there's... is there something then invidious in the notion that the word "discriminate" conveys?</text>
            <text syncTime="599.794" offset="2547066">Certainly, ordinarily "discriminate" means to differentiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.617" offset="2562426">Your Honor, in an oft-quoted statement by Representative Utterbach, who was the conference sponsor of the Robinson-Patman Act, he pointed out that discrimination means a difference or a differentiation only in those circumstances where the two people being differentiated have some reason or some justification to be treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.357" offset="2669319">Any difference doesn't automatically mean a discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.737" offset="2682902">The normal English language use of discrimination seems to us to mean something more than just a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.212" offset="2708816">It means a difference in a circumstance where you would expect or require equal treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.396" offset="2733476">Now that's certainly true when you have a supplier selling to two buyers who are at the same level in competing with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.152" offset="2764509">We suggest it's certainly not true where you have a supplier selling on one hand to a wholesaler, on the other hand to a retailer who are at two different levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.879" offset="2803484">Mr. Fishbein, how many courts have adopted this theory that you're... it's not a discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="667.182" offset="2816649">I know that everybody's heard Congressman Utterbach's comment for 50 years, but what... what's the principal judicial decision that says a mere price difference is not a discrimination?</text>

            <text syncTime="696.904" offset="2935559">It's our position in this case that Anheuser-Busch, while it has language in it that says a difference is a discrimination, is totally distinguishable from this case and shouldn't be applied--</text>

            <text syncTime="882.404" offset="3677541">Another way to answer that question, Your Honor, is to ask, what could the supplier do if it has a dual channel distribution system and it is selling to a wholesaler at a price that presumably covers his cost and provides for a profit and that wholesaler is aggressive and either is taking lower margins than other wholesalers or is willing for a period of time to try to expand its business and is selling by passing on the discount.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.079" offset="4548254">The Ninth Circuit ruled that a supplier's use of a functional discount constitutes price discrimination when the wholesaler passes on a portion of the discount to retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.148" offset="4592558">The supplier cannot show that the functional discount is cost based, and the retailers who buy from the wholesaler compete with other retailers who buy directly from the supplier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.409" offset="4849603">We believe that the... the word and the language of the statute that should be interpreted here are the effect language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.596" offset="4882308">The question is whether a discrimination between a wholesaler and a retailer in a legitimate functional discount causes the requisite anticompetitive effect described in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.696" offset="4926716">The Federal Trade Commission believes that it does not because the primary purpose of a functional discount is to shift distribution functions from a supplier to a middleman who assists in getting the goods to market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.695" offset="4986693">The interpretation of the language effect is that... is the identical interpretation given by the 1955 report of the Attorney General's national committee to study the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.132" offset="5036431">That committee also took a look at these issues and felt that the appropriate interpretation of the statute is to look to the word "effect" and to hold that a legitimate functional discount does not cause the requisite anticompetitive effects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.353" offset="7321309">Texaco's only objection to that instruction was based upon proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.438" offset="7341684">Justice O'Connor, you asked about instruction 20 and whether there was a proper objection in 23(A).</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.980" offset="7479820">The next day... the court the day before refused to give that instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3597.873" offset="14539464">To get to Justice Stevens' earlier question about the premise of this case, Your Honor, I think it is undisputed that the only damages on which the plaintiffs have asserted bases for damages are the sales by four stations which are supplied exclusively by Dompier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.550" offset="14630161">Therefore, if the sales to Dompier are not illegal, the damages for the early damage period for the middle of 1974 cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.554" offset="14670181">Since the damage evidence was presented from a whole period without breakout, the entire judgment cannot stand if the sales to Dompier solely as a wholesaler as an... who independently then sold to his retailers, it did not violate the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.578" offset="14746249">In terms of the post-1974 period, we do not agree that it is automatically unlawful for a supplier to give a wholesale discount to someone at the lower level who operates both as a wholesaler and a retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.039" offset="14812078">The case was not presented to the jury or tried on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.394" offset="14829528">Mr. Whaley, in his arguments to the jury at the close, said specifically... it's cited in our brief... it doesn't matter if Dompier operated these stations directly or was selling to them independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.879" offset="14871428">He had the same theory, which was if there's a pass-through, there's a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.223" offset="14892849">Therefore, the jury was never instructed, the court never dealt with the, the district court in the Ninth Circuit never discussed the Boise Cascade issue which that would deal with, and the case has to be remanded for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.473" offset="14945825">Finally, what's really at stake here is the fact that anytime a supplier deals with wholesalers and retails in a dual channel of distribution, it must charge a high... a lower price to the wholesaler; otherwise, the wholesaler will not be in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.303" offset="15013116">It cannot monitor the costs of the wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.766" offset="15027013">The reason for the wholesale discount is not to compensate for any particular functions.</text>
