            <text syncTime="14.843" offset="190930">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.045" offset="203678">The issue in this case is whether a violation of the time limits found in the pretrial detention statute require the release of a defendant who is subject to pretrial detention, no matter how strong the case for detention may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.923" offset="275253">The case comes to the Court from the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.993" offset="299495">But the facts, briefly stated, are as follows:</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="46.445" offset="317258">--He is still a fugitive as of this day, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.064" offset="327812">We have not rearrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.866" offset="342963">The defendant was picked up at a border patrol checkpoint some distance from the Mexican border in New Mexico, and found to be carrying 72 pounds of cocaine in his truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.810" offset="406806">He chatted with the border patrol officers at that time and agreed to participate in a continuation of the investigation... the so-called "controlled" delivery in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.302" offset="460723">He was flown to Chicago to participate in the controlled delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.106" offset="475978">The idea, of course, being to try to capture the people who were buying the cocaine from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="497608">And the agents... one of the agents drove the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.795" offset="510669">The controlled delivery failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.695" offset="518297">The buyers did not show up and Mr. Montalvo was immediately taken into district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.750" offset="546509">A complaint and warrant were filed, and he was ordered to... transferred back to New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.137" offset="572109">In New Mexico a detention hearing was set and held.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.625" offset="594052">The day of that detention hearing was February 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.910" offset="607218">He had been initially arrested on February 8th, and the transfer hearing had occurred on February 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.981" offset="631459">At the detention hearing, the magistrate, noting that no pre-trial services report had been made and that Mr. Montalvo's counsel had just been hired about three hours before the hearing, granted a continuance, which... the magistrate was apparently under a misapprehension had been requested by the government, but in fact there's nothing in the record that reflects it was requested by the government, until February 21st, which was two working days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.214" offset="744413">This was over the President's Day holiday weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.350" offset="756951">At that hearing the magistrate then took evidence and decided that Mr. Montalvo was releasable.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.856" offset="786940">The government immediately took an appeal, and two days later the district court took evidence in a much longer hearing and decided that Mr. Montalvo was in fact not releasable under the pretrial detention standards of the act because he was both a risk of flight and also he presented a case of dangerousness to the community that could not be disposed of by any conditions placed on his liberty.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="189.923" offset="891221">Mr. Bryson, do you concede that the government failed to comply with the statute here?</text>
            <text syncTime="196.427" offset="917239">You want us to consider the case in that posture?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="199.712" offset="930404">We do.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.731" offset="934480">We have brought the case to this Court without contesting the question of whether there was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.885" offset="959035">As we've indicated--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="207.801" offset="962692">Certainly it might have been contested, might it not--</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="210.587" stopTime="211.620">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="210.587" offset="973872">--It was contested in the district court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="211.620" stopTime="213.322">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="211.620" offset="978052">--that there was waiver or one thing and another.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="213.322" stopTime="272.327">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="213.322" offset="984844">There are a number of grounds on which it could be contested, and in fact we did contest it both in the district court and in the court of appeals, but we lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.943" offset="1011280">And we think the more important question is, assuming a violation, what follows from that?</text>
            <text syncTime="225.179" offset="1032282">Now, the district court, having found that Mr. Montalvo was detainable both on risk of flight and on dangerousness, nonetheless said that there was no legal way that the court could detain him because the court found there had been a violation of the time limits of the act, principally because the waiver in Chicago of his right to a detention hearing had not been adequate under Johnson against Zerbst.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.782" offset="1150669">And that the magistrate, on February 16th, had failed to... what the magistrate had done that was wrong is that he had a granted a sua sponte continuance rather than having a motion made by one of the parties for a continuance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="272.327" stopTime="278.231">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="272.327" offset="1220886">You were going to tell us of what other possibilities than release are available.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="278.231" stopTime="371.157">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="278.231" offset="1244501">Yes, Your Honor... Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.697" offset="1250352">Just very briefly, the court of appeals affirmed on what amount, for our purposes, to essentially the same grounds as the district court, saying that simply the fact that there was a time violation meant that he had to be released on conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.193" offset="1316285">Now, our position is that the... once there has been a violation, that the language and purposes of the pretrial detention statute do not require automatic release.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.570" offset="1385771">In fact we look to both the language of the statute and the purposes underlying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.939" offset="1403325">And we suggest that what the statute is really about is it provides a limited period within which somebody can be held prior to a detention hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.680" offset="1450241">It does not provide or suggest and shouldn't be held to provide that a detention hearing must be held within a specific period of time, and if it is not held within that period of time that the defendant may not, for any purpose thereafter, be detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.910" offset="1527146">The language of the statute does not specify, as the court of appeals noted, what the consequences of a violation are.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.997" offset="1555567">The language is simply that a hearing shall be held immediately upon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer, absent a continuance for a period of three days or five days or longer if there's good cause found.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="371.157" stopTime="375.228">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="371.157" offset="1616171">Well, is this a violation without relief or a remedy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="375.228" stopTime="476.594">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="375.228" offset="1632471">Well, I don't think so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.295" offset="1636756">The relief is... is a form of relief that the defendant can see prospectively, if he is in fact held for longer than the period that the statute permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.751" offset="1674581">Let me give an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.035" offset="1679701">Suppose Mr. Montalvo had decided on February 13th, before the detention hearing, that in fact he had already been held for as long as he could lawfully be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.724" offset="1722437">He could have moved in the district court for release at that point or, in the alternative, a prompt hearing immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.247" offset="1752530">And because the statute provides a period of lawful, pretrial relief... pretrial detention prior to the holding of a hearing, which is confined to a period of three days or two days... excuse me... three days or five days, depending on who moves for the continuance, he might very well have been able to persuade the magistrate at that point that the government no longer had a right to detain him, absent a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.564" offset="1861827">So he would have been able to obtain either a hearing right then or release right then.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.718" offset="1882411">But once he's past that, once he has failed to raise that point, and we are on into the detention period and we're... well, a hearing has occurred, and he has been found to be detainable, then you can't go back and say, well, he shouldn't have been held for that period of time between the expiration of the period that the statute permits and the time that the detention hearing was actually held.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.751" offset="1974571">And because he shouldn't have been held for that two or three-day period, he can't be detained forever at... ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.088" offset="2003828">That the statute simply doesn't suggest that that kind of remedy is appropriate, looking retrospectively for that kind of violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.209" offset="2132351">But normally, what the act provides is this is a period of lawful detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.928" offset="2151263">It doesn't necessarily mean that anything beyond this is necessarily unlawful because they may be circumstances in which the inherent authority of the court comes into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.291" offset="2224720">It would be under the authority of an arrest warrant, so it would be the... it would be the marshal who would hold the person but the authority would be granted by the arrest warrant under which the person was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.180" offset="2268292">And there would have to be, for example, a preliminary examination within a period of ten days if the individual was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.786" offset="2294623">And at the expiration of that period, a hearing would have to be held to determine probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.821" offset="2314790">But... what I think the statute does, to answer your question, is the statute provides for an area of lawfulness to hold, pending a hearing, but doesn't necessarily mean that, in extraordinary circumstances, holding a person for some other purpose, may be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.703" offset="2402352">This just gives us a safe ground for the--</text>

            <text syncTime="586.582" offset="2477898">The extraordinary cases, let me point out, really, in the cases that come before the statute that are discussed in the Senate report on this... on this act, make the point that these are really are exceptional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.956" offset="2519381">They are cases, for example, in which an individual has made very clear threats against witnesses, where the court simply has no other option but to hold the individual under the inherent authority of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.684" offset="2598271">Ordinarily, the statute would provide the outer limit on the period that you could be held without a detention hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.523" offset="2629618">But again, that does not mean that the remedy for holding longer than that period is that you automatically say no detention hearing can be held and no detention can be ordered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.263" offset="5028599">Here, by the same token, the error in temporary detention is rendered, in a sense, harmless by the fact that he is later found to be detainable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.290" offset="5404658">The magistrate... the presentation before the magistrate was extremely brief, and the presentation before the district court was much longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.980" offset="5431407">And before the district court, the district court concluded that, based on a lot of evidence, that this was an extremely strong case for detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.086" offset="5471844">And in fact there is... the argument in favor of becoming a fugitive, in this case, must have seemed to Mr. Montalvo, an extremely strong one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.105" offset="5591903">But that never happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.807" offset="5606741">In any event, this was a case in which if there ever is a case in which the remedy of precluding detention is appropriate, this is not that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.881" offset="5651044">Now, I would point out that the argument that's being made on the other side, as I understand it, is essentially that the hearing time limits established, in essence, a condition precedent for detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.063" offset="5739756">But that argument is an extremely sweeping one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.546" offset="5749683">If you say that any statute that says that something shall be done according to the following provisions, and that's what this statute says, means that it may not, in any event... that the hearing is in this case... may not be held unless those procedures are followed, would suggest that all of the procedures that are found in Section F are conditions precedent to detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.166" offset="5860233">And yet there are a lot of procedures in which there may be a minor error here or there among the procedures in Subsection F, just as there are many provisions in Title 18, as to which there may be a minor error here and there without undercutting a defendant's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.711" offset="5930346">Under Subsection F, there may be a variety of errors that could be made, none of which end up being prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.233" offset="5972455">And you would not say that the hearing simply cannot be held or that the detention cannot be ordered because of those kinds of orders, assuming that you conclude that they really didn't prejudice the defendant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard J. Panetta, II</label>
            <text syncTime="1478.480" offset="6045493">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.098" offset="6063884">It is Respondent's position that this statute, as a text, that the intent of Congress is manifest in the text of the statute, that the language is clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.072" offset="6115815">If the government had followed it in this case, we wouldn't be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.608" offset="6133996">And the problems that the government suggest arises, when the statute is not followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.362" offset="6156984">If this Court tells other courts, tells the government, tells defendants that the language is manifest... is mandatory, the problems won't arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.903" offset="6203169">If the government in Chicago, at Mr. Montalvo's initial appearance, had moved for a continuance, stating that it needed to remove Mr. Montalvo back to New Mexico, that more time than three days would have been required to hold the hearing, and the court there would have been satisfied that the government had established good cause, we wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.403" offset="6309121">The government did not choose to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.605" offset="6321973">The government did not choose to bring Mr. Montalvo before a magistrate in New Mexico, which is probably the primary source of the confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.228" offset="6352484">He's arrested on the 8th; he is taken to the very building in Las Cruces where the magistrate's courtroom is, to talk with the DEA for a period of time about his cooperation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.906" offset="6427195">The magistrate is a resident of Las Cruces and he is always there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.976" offset="6447466">When the government needs to get a search warrant, it calls the magistrate's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.380" offset="6469095">The magistrate makes himself available to sign those warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.749" offset="6482574">So there is someone there that is available if the government requests that they be available and explains that there is a necessity for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.460" offset="6553418">He lives in Las Cruces, and he has moved back to Las Cruces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.579" offset="6565853">So Chief Judge Bratton is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.964" offset="6575361">If it were an emergency, if the government needed to go before a district court judge, Chief Judge Bratton lives in Las Cruces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.637" offset="6610052">In this instance, the government chose to take Mr. Montalvo to Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.874" offset="6631054">There's no dispute that the government moved to detain him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.743" offset="6642548">All they had to do at that time was say we need more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.195" offset="6656341">The government, to suggest that the burden should shift to Mr. Montalvo, to announce to the court that I need a swift hearing, seems to me to be a bit ludicrous in the sense that Mr. Montalvo is unrepresented, sitting in jail in Las Cruces, New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.589" offset="6729902">Now, just exactly how was he supposed to notify the court that he is entitled to a speedy hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.643" offset="6754143">Counsel was appointed finally on the 15th; our office is retained on the 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.897" offset="6783087">The magistrate in Las Cruces and my office was unaware that the government had moved to detain Mr. Montalvo in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.438" offset="6821330">We objected to the court holding any detention hearing at all because the government had not complied with the statute as far as we understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.460" offset="6857379">The United States attorney, there in court, never advised the court... never advised us that such was the case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1690.183" offset="6892279">Mr. Panetta, what do you say to the government's main argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.268" offset="6904609">I don't think they're contesting that they made a mistake here; that they didn't follow the proper procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.005" offset="6931567">But I think their basic argument is no harm, no foul.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.957" offset="6947345">That had there been a prompt hearing, the result of that hearing would have been exactly what happened anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.736" offset="7018502">--Most respectfully, I don't think that's the issue at all, as to what harm was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.822" offset="7034803">The issue is whether or not, if you follow the government's position, you're telling Congress you've made mandatory language here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.660" offset="7066150">We don't have to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.945" offset="7071270">If you're going to use a harmless error analysis, you're telling Congress when you told us that the hearing had to be held at the initial appearance, you didn't mean that because it doesn't have to be held at the initial appearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.576" offset="8101853">In cases that are cited in both briefs that talk about waiver and that talk about removal and talk about whether or not you have to move to detain in the district of arrest or in the charging district, if this court tells other courts that the language is mandatory and has to be followed, those problems no longer exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.543" offset="8197670">If he's arrested in a district other than the charging district, the government moves to detain at the initial appearance and files a motion for a continuance beyond the three days for good cause, because he's got to be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.351" offset="8248974">If someone comes in... the government suggested you could sandbag a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.970" offset="8263394">And says, don't worry, bond's not an issue here; we're not concerned about bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.922" offset="8279172">The government moves to detain, makes a proffer, as it can rightly do of what its evidence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.611" offset="8305921">If there's no question about bond, the defense attorney doesn't say anything, the magistrate finds that the statute has been complied with, the government has met his burden and the man is detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.918" offset="8351165">There's no confusion, if the statute is read the way Congress has written it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.550" offset="8965774">And he didn't act in 120 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.585" offset="8973820">And someone was saying... coming in and saying, well, you no longer have the power to act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.839" offset="8998898">This court said, well, that didn't mean that he had to decide within the 120 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.194" offset="9032334">There, I think, there were a couple of differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.463" offset="9041425">In that statute there was no escape valve, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.665" offset="9062218">There was no excusable neglect like in the appellate statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.902" offset="9083116">There was no good cause like in our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.938" offset="9099312">Also, in the legislative history of that act, when the sponsor of the bill was being questioned by one of the congressmen, he was asked, well, does this mean that the Secretary has to rule within that 120 days?</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.429" offset="9145288">He said, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.614" offset="9149990">Here, I believe, the legislative history is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.150" offset="9164096">The Congress had the District of Columbia's preventive detention statute before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.554" offset="9189696">The preventive detention statute in the District of Columbia allows the government to move at any time to detain, not at an individual's initial appearance but when the government believes it should move to detain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.695" offset="9238284">The second part of that statute is the same as the one that we have here, that when they move to detain, the government may get a continuance of three days, the defendant of five or, if you can show good cause, a further amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.621" offset="9298052">Clearly, the Congress was aware of that statute and could have provided that the government could move to detain at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.358" offset="9328981">It didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.060" offset="9335773">This Court, in Salerno, in upholding the constitutionality of this statute, looked to the protections that Congress had put in to find that preventive detention was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.285" offset="9384674">This is one of the very protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.253" offset="9392511">If we say that it's harmless not to abide by them, does that challenge the issue of whether or not it's still constitutional, if you don't have to comply with those conditions?</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.106" offset="9519988">That the government can move to detain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.508" offset="9529601">And if there are exceptional circumstances that arise that require the government to have more time, they can request more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.449" offset="9577353">The analogy, I think, to Rule 4 is an apt one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.423" offset="9625209">I believe that the time limits within the statute are jurisdictional and mandatory and should be so held by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.301" offset="9692710">To do otherwise, I believe, would be to eviscerate the clear language of the statute and to substitute this court's view rather than the legislature, which has already spoken clearly and unambiguously.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2429.945" stopTime="2579.208">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="2429.945" offset="9851325">Only a couple of points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.980" offset="9863446">First, I think the closest analogy to the case of a statute or rule that has mandatory language that does not typically result in any sanctions or any remedy that results in disabling the government from proceeding, is the initial appearance rule which is closely related to the pretrial detention rule, and that's Rule 5 which says that someone shall be taken to a magistrate upon arrest without unnecessary delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.333" offset="9980893">Assume that there isn't a statement which is taken from the individual and subject to suppression during the period of unnecessary delay... the mere fact of delay has never been held or thought to result in the dismissal of the proceedings against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.126" offset="10044004">It... and yet I think it's interesting to note that in fact, despite the absence of any remedy, compliance with this statute, with this... excuse me, with this rule, is quite good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.250" offset="10096563">I mean, the agents are trained and they do follow their training to bring people before magistrates without unnecessary delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.256" offset="10128537">There are exceptional cases and, indeed, this one may be one in which, shortly after arrest, there's an agreement to cooperate, but... in which the appearance does not occur immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.164" offset="10172213">But typically it occurs within a matter of hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.766" offset="10182558">The second point is that... it's important to keep in mind, I think, when you look at the argument made by Respondent with respect to the contention that the... it's no real harm to the government to be put back in the position of simply having to ask for conditions on release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.095" offset="10267926">Because, after all, that was the system before 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.064" offset="10279733">But there's been a very big and important change in this statute from the pre-1984 system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.785" offset="10302617">What Congress did in '84 was to make essentially a bargain in favor of candor and fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.557" offset="10337725">And the bargain was this: there would be a pretrial detention provision in which pretrial detention could be ordered directly, candidly; where this is what we're doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.895" offset="10371058">But there was a provision that said, you cannot hold somebody on unrealistically high bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.567" offset="10397807">If you're going to set bail, it's got to be bail that that person can meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.702" offset="10410346">That's the reason that bail in this case, when it way set, was set at $88,000 instead of half a million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.922" offset="10431244">If it had been under the old system, it would have been simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.272" offset="10440648">They wouldn't have had a hearing at all, or not much of one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.397" offset="10489131">And what it means is, people like Mr. Montalvo, who somehow manage to avoid the detention statute, even though they should be detained, are given a free pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.788" offset="10526643">Under the old statute, bail would have been set at a very high level, and he would never have gotten out.</text>
