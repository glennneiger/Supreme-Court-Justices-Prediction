            <text syncTime="71.607" offset="435789">The first question was whether claimants were entitled to receive unemployment compensation benefits after being fired as drug counselors.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.023" offset="465464">It is undisputed that they violated their employer's job-related rule that they be drug free because they ingested peyote in the ceremonies of the Native American Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.678" offset="504020">A majority of this Court held that the claimants were not entitled to unemployment benefits under the doctrine of Sherbert v. Verner if their conduct, even if religiously motivated, violated a valid Oregon criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.557" offset="563580">After the Oregon Supreme Court's ultimate decision on federal grounds on remand, the question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.132" offset="589806">Does the Free Exercise Clause require every state to exempt the religious peyote use by the Native American Church, or perhaps even beyond that, other substance use by other religions, from the reach of generally applicable criminal laws regulating the use of controlled substances by all citizens?</text>

            <text syncTime="205.486" offset="971299">We are obviously acutely aware, as in all Free Exercise cases, of the sensitive interests that are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.419" offset="995018">On one hand we recognize that this is a genuine church with doctrinal beliefs in peyote use that are real.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.005" offset="1021349">The church's members are unquestionably sincere, and the adherents generally... genuinely believe that the existence of their religion is threatened if they are not free to use this substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.478" offset="1151230">Footnote 8 of our reply brief is a careful parsing of the states that provide, either by legislative exemption or judicial decision, an exemption for religious peyote use, sometimes by a named religion, other times more generically referring to bonafide religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.470" offset="1215178">But the number by our count is closer to 12 or 13.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.763" offset="2180350">However, we would assume that they would be reporting illegal trafficking, as opposed to that which they regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.969" offset="2201248">The Oregon Supreme Court's resolution of the federal law question, we believe, seriously compromises three compelling and intersecting state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.543" offset="2239491">The first is the state's interest in regulating all peyote and hallucinogenic drug use to... in order to further the health and safety interests of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.550" offset="2279511">The second is the state's interest in a regulatory scheme as a whole, so that law enforcement does not face a patchwork of exemptions of other drugs on a drug-by-drug, religion-by-religion, believer-by-believer basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.449" offset="2331129">And the third and compelling interest is that the state constitution's heightened requirement of neutrality in our jurisdiction, requires it to avoid giving the preference of one church over another.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.006" offset="2381389">Let me then examine these concerns in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.988" offset="2393300">Peyote, by all accounts, is a powerful and unpredictable hallucinogen.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.063" offset="2413571">That fact is largely conceded even by Respondents, at least for the public generally, and it is amply illustrated by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.346" offset="2438753">Its active ingredient is mescaline.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.100" offset="2449725">It stimulates respiratory changes, reflexes and pulse rates, which are physiologically measurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.814" offset="2472608">The spectrum of effects experienced are similar, and in most respects identical, to those of LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, accompanied by vivid visual and auditory hallucinations, altered perceptions of time, space and body... emotional reactions that range from joy and exhilaration to extreme anxiety and even terror.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.528" offset="2559439">There is no way to predict, even for the experienced user, how the user will react on a given occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.733" offset="2588278">There are effects on the central nervous system and behavior which cause inability to distinguish reality and non-reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.916" offset="2617013">And it does induce psychotic reactions in a small number of users.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.216" offset="2678244">To quote from the record in Smith's case Exhibit 8 from a clinical substance special... abuse specialist, it is a powerful and potent agent which does sometimes have long-lasting negative effects on its user, with no predictability as to when that can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.609" offset="2751805">It is "very risky".</text>
            <text syncTime="652.930" offset="2761000">The record is consistent with what is known generally about this substance, and why every jurisdiction in the country regulates it intensely.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.825" offset="2792660">It is almost universally a Schedule I drug, which means that it has a high potential for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.371" offset="2814812">There is no currently accepted medical use, and there is lack of accepted safety for use even under medical supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.105" offset="2845741">The experiences under the influence of this substance may be good, but they are unpredictable, and they are indifferent to the motives of the user.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.061" offset="2881581">The risk is largely unquestioned by Respondents, and the risk cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the risk of using any other hallucinogen.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.247" offset="2910316">These dangers are great enough that Oregon has chosen, with respect to any user, to have a blanket regulation without exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.583" offset="2947619">In the face of these considerations, the Oregon Supreme Court has concluded, however, that the federal Constitution commands a judicially crafted exemption for sincere adult users of a single church.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.611" offset="2995789">And this poses for us a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.202" offset="3006133">On the one hand, if the exemption is crafted so narrowly that it applies to one group on a de minimis basis, then that means that our state and federal constitutions have preferred one religion over another, and hopelessly compromised the constitution requirements of neutrality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.346" offset="6170711">That is, we have a claim by Respondent that line drawing of the kind that we find so objectionable in pursuit of our interests in religious neutrality is easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.734" offset="6212298">And we point to the lower federal court cases suggesting that other persons using peyote, other persons using hashish, LSD or marijuana for sincere religious reasons, that those cases can be easily distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.002" offset="6261304">We simply invite this Court's careful review of those cases, which are shamelessly result-driven and involve religious gerrymandering from which no consistent neutral principle emerges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.199" offset="6306130">And our point is that if we cannot accommodate on equal grounds, then the requirement of accommodation must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.153" offset="6337895">And there is a final and critical point here related to our health and safety interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.388" offset="6354926">That is that denominational practices, and indeed individual believers, even in long-standing religions, can and do change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.663" offset="6395991">They change the nature of their religious beliefs, they change the nature of their doctrine, and that is the very essence of freedom of religion and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.559" offset="6427547">So a constitutional exemption that is bound in time and place is very risky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.543" offset="6455550">If we exempt a practice, even if we are presently satisfied by its safety, control passes forever into private hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.050" offset="6493480">And that is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.150" offset="6501944">But then we must ask, before we let that control pass in the form of a constitutional exemption, denomination specific or not, now and in the future, what are the contours of that exemption and how will it be conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.671" offset="6564011">Because if the denominational or church controls weaken or change, there are still enshrined in the Bill of Rights a permanent exemption for the practices of that religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.362" offset="8038780">There is some kind of legislative fact finding when Congress and other states have acted to exempt the use of peyote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.338" offset="8074724">They have based this in large part, for instance, on testimony before Congress, the factual findings by the California supreme court in People v. Woody, that there have been no evidence that there have been harmful use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.365" offset="8122789">The first point I wanted to make is that this case is indistinguishable from the previous unemployment cases before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.724" offset="8164272">The Oregon Supreme Court has now decided twice, as a matter of state law, that the criminality of Respondent's conduct is immaterial to Oregon's unemployment compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.763" offset="8220383">And I think the point, I believe it was raised by Justice O'Connor, is important here, and that is the reason the Oregon Supreme Court did not address its constitutional question under state law is because the criminality was not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.574" offset="8291645">The statement of the Oregon Supreme Court on remand could not have been clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.607" offset="8311707">It said we also stated that it was immaterial to Oregon's unemployment compensation law whether the use of peyote violated some other law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.074" offset="8357578">It didn't say it was constrained by the previous decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.581" offset="8395612">So the two reasons that this Court used in the majority opinion last time to find that the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court was ambiguous, and that was why this decision had been remanded, has now been cleared up.</text>
