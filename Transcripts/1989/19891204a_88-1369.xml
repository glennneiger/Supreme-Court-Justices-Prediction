            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143764">We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1369, Maryland v. Jerome Edward Buie.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.977" offset="179604">Mr. Sweeney, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="46.763" offset="330801">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="50.363" offset="345116">The issue in this case is whether police officers possessing an... a arrest warrant for an armed robbery suspect may, at the time of the arrest of the suspect in his home, make a brief security check of the premises to determine if other persons are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.189" offset="428499">The Maryland Court of Appeals decided that the state must show that there is probable cause to believe that a serious and demonstrable potentiality for danger exists to justify a safety check in this type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.400" offset="497357">Finding the probable cause for a safety check did not exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.143" offset="520241">It held that a red running suit seized by one of the officers during the security check should have been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.150" offset="552319">A new trial was ordered, setting aside Mr. Buie's 35-year sentence for armed robbery and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.474" offset="593593">The state asserts that safety checks of homes at the time of arrest, under the authority of an arrest warrant, should be analyzed under the general reasonableness balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.986" offset="647614">Applying this test, the balancing of Mr. Buie's minimal privacy interest affected by the safety check against the compelling need to preserve the safety of officers and others at the arrest scene, is best met by establishing a bright-line rule, a single, workable standard authorizing a brief and limited check of the home, without any need for objective justification in each case.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.775" offset="822843">We argue that also in the alternative, the reasonable suspicion test.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.100" offset="844159">We, however, believe that this is best served by a categorical rule, a bright-line rule which would authorize such checks in every situation of an in-home arrest for a dangerous crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.588" offset="906017">As a practical matter, what is the police practice on in-home arrests?</text>
            <text syncTime="195.853" offset="927124">Is it typical that a so-called protective sweep be made, or is it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="200.808" offset="946977">There is nothing evidentiary in this record on that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.181" offset="968397">However, since the... this Court's decision in Chimel, there have been legions of cases which have been collected by both parties and which have been analyzed in the law reviews, which indicate that this is a very common police practice, indeed a police rubric, after an arrest to conduct a limited sweep of the premises to determine if other individuals are on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.391" offset="1081246">This type of procedure has been recognized by the 12 federal circuits, by 33 state courts, as prudent police conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.148" offset="1128267">In this case, was there sufficient basis on which the officers could have obtained a search warrant at the same time they got the arrest warrant?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.504" offset="1169749">If the officers, at the time they obtained the arrest warrant, if there was a standard that required a warrant in such situations, we believe that a warrant could have been obtained, but that is... in a sense backs right into our bright-line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.412" offset="1273403">Because, it is our contention, that every arrest for a dangerous crime is the type of situation that requires a safety check to be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.767" offset="5206817">The Maryland Court of Appeals, in our view, got off to the right start in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.190" offset="5228446">It explained correctly that in deciding what legal standard to apply to a protective sweep a court must consider the objective expectation of privacy that may exist and the governmental interest served by the intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.059" offset="5279960">But having taken that first step, the court erred, in our view, in elaborating that rule in this context, by overstating the intrusiveness of a protective sweep and undervaluing the governmental interest to justify those searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.278" offset="5336802">The court resolved upon what we believe to be an untenable legal standard, that a protective sweep may be conducted only upon a showing of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.545" offset="5373896">We urge a different rule, the rule that has been approved by virtually every federal circuit other than, I think, the Fifth Circuit, and one that is based on our quite different assessment of the competing interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.904" offset="5419349">That rule is the one derived from Terry against Ohio, and it is this: Following an arrest inside a suspect's premises, the, a protective sweep is lawful when the police have a reasonable belief that their security is in jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.727" offset="8154579">And what that really amounts to is shear conjecture about at some point three girls being in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.941" offset="8187493">And the reason for that is that the police officers testified that as they approached the house and entered the house they found two girls on the front steps outside.</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.115" offset="9228211">It, perhaps, from a subjective police point of view, is prudent to check the house for possible third parties in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.946" offset="9291532">But I think that particular point of view ignores the other side of the equation that has to be balanced, which is the privacy rights of the people that inhabit the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.736" offset="9338657">In fact, the Fourth Amendment in general does require some degree, at least, of particularized suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.261" offset="9368750">Now, in order to overcome that normal requirement, the state would have to show first that there is a relatively minimal intrusion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.728" offset="9422667">And I think the intrusion that is involved in a protective sweep is really akin to the intrusion of a full-blown search of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.803" offset="9458925">It involves opening up the private places of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.678" offset="9478464">Perhaps, at least within the state's view of a protective sweep, it's limited to the extent that the police could not go into small spaces, such as drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.368" offset="9525171">But the state, I believe, would concede that they can open up closet doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.984" offset="9547637">And I think what is inside a closet may be just as private to a reasonable individual as what is inside a drawer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.160" offset="9576371">So, I think in character the protective sweep is essentially the same as a full-blown sweep, which is perhaps, as far as searches of places, the most closely protected kind of intrusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.789" offset="11154899">That leads to a point that Justice Scalia was making about whether they in fact took reasonable action once they had made the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.447" offset="11201501">Now, of course, the cases do not require the police to take the less intrusive alternative when two alternatives are both reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.494" offset="11249671">But I think on the facts of this case, what Justice Scalia was suggesting indicates that the action that they did take was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.811" offset="11286974">On the one hand, the action that they did take was that an officer, purporting to fear somebody down in the basement, went down there with no apparent precautions taken, apparently not even his gun drawn, and in fact was setting himself up as easy prey for an ambusher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.274" offset="11372760">On the other hand, what they could have done, which is what at least they began to do, which is they whisked Mr. Buie out of the house, and then an unintrusive additional action, which to me is perfectly sensible, would have been simply to station somebody in the hallway of the house in a protected position, so that if there was a chance of somebody coming up out of the basement they would have the drop on that individual, rather than vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.995" offset="11495744">So this is a situation where I think the failure to take the less intrusive alternative in fact makes the alternative that they did take unreasonable.</text>
