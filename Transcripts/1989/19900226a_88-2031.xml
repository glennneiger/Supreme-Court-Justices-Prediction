            <text syncTime="35.065" offset="288221">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.598" offset="310373">A divided panel of that court held that the Postal Service regulation prohibiting solicitation on postal premises, in effect in its current form since 1978, was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.214" offset="468780">The building is a freestanding building, and this concrete apron which functions as the access walkway to the building is set back at all points more than 75 feet from the city sidewalk and the public highway that form the front boundary of the postal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.527" offset="542027">There is a canopy over the walkway in the front entrance area.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.323" offset="857273">I... I think it is, Your Honor, and I think it follows from common sense, as Justice Blackmun noted in his separate opinion in the Heffron case.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.447" offset="889769">If you're walking down the street and you look ahead and see someone passing out leaflets, you know that you can take the leaflet and stick it in your pocket or read it later or toss in the nearest trash can.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.896" offset="931565">By the same token, picketing, which is permitted on postal property, if you look ahead and you see someone carrying a picket sign, you know that when you get there you can read the sign if you wish, react to it if you wish or just keep walking.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.565" offset="982243">A solicitor, however, seeks to engage the passerby in an immediate face-to-face confrontation that has as its objective an immediate act of financial charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.942" offset="1027696">That type of conduct is, as the Postal Service found, inherently more aggressive than leafletting or picketing or discussion, and it was that type of conduct that the Postal Service found created congestion, impeding patrons in their transaction of postal business, and distracted postmasters and clerks from their duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.291" offset="1137096">That is not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.491" offset="1145874">The regulations prohibit campaigning for public office; but, assuming that's not the sort of petition we're talking about, that's not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.036" offset="1176071">Now, I will agree that that type of conduct has many of the same burdens associated with soliciting charity, but, in fact, the Postal Service had not found any problem with that sort of activity on postal premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.286" offset="1233123">There are people who want to leaflet on postal premises, who want to picket and who want to seek signatures for petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.430" offset="1257678">It's when you let them ask for money that the crowds come out and that the problems are experienced.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.713" offset="1278785">So in 1978 the Postal Service narrowly targeted that type of expressive activity that was causing the problem and prohibited only that.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.142" offset="1328522">The problems were congestion at postal entryways, the distraction of the postmasters and their clerks from their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.769" offset="1359033">This case is a very good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.131" offset="1364466">On the day in question, the postmaster and his clerks were compelled to field 40 to 50 complaints from customers concerning respondents' activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.047" offset="1404172">Are these problems that could be addressed by time, place and manner requirements, by making the location of such a booth or a table more out of the way and prohibiting it on peak... at peak hours or peak days or something of that sort?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="337.844" stopTime="402.455">
            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="337.844" offset="1499363">The Service expressly considered that alternative in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.538" offset="1518066">It determined, given the fact that we're talking about more than 35,000 separate facilities around the country with various different architectural configurations and surrounding environments, that it would be an administrative and logistic nightmare to attempt to draw time, place and manner restrictions for each of those 35,000 facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.941" offset="1599673">It further determined that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to enforce those sorts of restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.116" offset="1632378">Most postal facilities do not have security forces, and it would be impossible to monitor compliance with the time, place and manner restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.881" offset="1671457">Finally, it concluded that such a system, which would leave considerable discretion with local postmasters either in... in implementation or enforcement, was undesirable given the far-flung nature of the commercial enterprise because they were concerned that the postmasters would discriminate on the basis of viewpoint or content.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.455" offset="1757766">Well, Mr. Roberts, I would assume that if the post offices are permitting petition gathering, signature gathering, that some of those could be conducted in a very aggressive manner, and very likely the Post Office is willing to have some kind of restrictions or regulations that it's willing to enforce to make sure that patrons aren't subjected to abusive tactics.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.040" offset="2072071">The reason the Postal Service did not want to rely on such ad hoc prohibitions is because solicitation was causing a broader problem that couldn't be addressed on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.141" offset="2128496">The problems we've talked about inhibiting postal patrons, giving rise to complaints by the postal patrons, taking up the postmaster's time accompanies solicitation that is not disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.043" offset="2192130">It does not necessarily block the entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.986" offset="2199862">The Postal Service concluded after an experience with limited solicitation that there wasn't enough room for everybody who wanted to solicit on postal property and further concluded that allowing limited solicitation carried with it more problems than it was worth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.616" offset="13706383">What our position is is that the right to solicit, what's been referred to by the court below as classic political speech, is not subject to the grace of government, to an architectural design or to a fluke of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.505" offset="13753926">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.572" offset="13774197">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.021" offset="13780048">First of all, Justice Blackmun, the cite for the authority to issue these regulations is 39 U.S.C., Section 401, subsection 2 in the Postal Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.620" offset="13830412">The distinction between the interior and the exterior is one that the Postal Service did not adopt in issuing these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.206" offset="13868760">Permitting solicitation on the outside carries many of the same administrative problems that would accompany permitting solicitation in the postal lobbies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.712" offset="13902824">Certainly where you're talking about solicitation as in this case where the people go, which is the entranceway, it carries at least the same degree of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.457" offset="13937723">And as the Court articulated in the Cornelius case, the government doesn't have to wait until havoc is wreaked to act in restricting access with respect to a nonpublic forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.546" offset="13986102">I understood my brother to concede that if the Postal Service eliminated all extraneous activities and barred all sorts of expression, there would be no constitutional objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.863" offset="14031346">I take that concession to be somewhat inconsistent with an argument that this is a traditional public forum, and I take it to mean that what we're talking about is a limited public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.569" offset="14074187">But again, as the Court has made clear, in a limited public forum selective access does not mean that everyone has the right to come and go and do whatever activities they wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.497" offset="14121939">The government can preserve the property under its control for the purposes to which it is dedicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.143" offset="14144509">Thank you.</text>
