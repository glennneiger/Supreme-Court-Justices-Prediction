            <text syncTime="17.293" offset="216520">Nancy Cruzan is a 32-year-old Missouri woman who is in a persistent vegetative state.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.331" offset="252569">Persistent vegetative state is a specific clinical diagnosis for a patient who is permanently unconscious.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.921" offset="286946">All thought, all memory, all ability to interact with the world around her in any way is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.593" offset="321637">It is undisputed in the record below that Nancy will never recover from this condition and will never interact with the world around her.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.882" offset="358835">She's been in this condition for over six years, the result of a car accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.251" offset="376285">Approximately three weeks after the accident, when hope for her recovery remained strong, her parents and her husband at the time consented to the surgical insertion of a gastrostomy tube necessary to feed Nancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.660" offset="437934">No one told the Cruzans at that time that their consent was irrevocable; no one suggested to them that the purpose of this surgical insertion of the tube was to perpetuate Nancy in an unconscious state indefinitely.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.363" offset="548798">Apparently your opponents say that it is... it would have been more difficult, but that she could have been fed manually by... by massaging the food down her throat or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.705" offset="606163">Is that correct or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="118.824" offset="622568">At the time the tube was inserted, Nancy had just come out of intensive care.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.295" offset="648481">She was being fed through... it's not completely clear in the record, but it appears both a nasogastric tube and through an I.V. tube.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.167" offset="679932">It was clear that her long-term care was going to require more nutrition, and the operational report for the surgery stated that the reason for the surgery was malnutrition.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.959" offset="727162">After the tube was inserted, when she transferred out of the hospital and into the rehabilitation center, they attempted to feed her through mouth while she still had the tube in place, but they were not able to feed her sufficiently to provide for her needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.843" offset="1242715">--The state would not necessarily have to accept that determination, and certainly there are instances like the Jehovah's Witness cases where the state will intervene and take steps to... provide the medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.484" offset="1297258">My statement is that, in this case, where the parents would have been... had a doctor come to them and said, there's virtually no chance your daughter is going to recover from this car accident, we want to do this surgery, we need your consent to do it, and the parents said, I don't want to give that consent, I don't think she's going to recover, the doctors would have honored that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.651" offset="1401852">Now, if the decision is considered abusive, if it's considered one that's not among acceptable medical alternatives, then the state has an interest in intervening.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.792" offset="1454515">The issue before this case... before this Court today is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.212" offset="1488161">And it is whether a state can order a person to receive invasive medical treatment when that order is contrary to the wishes of the family, when it overrides all available evidence about the person's wishes from prior to the accident, when the decision to forego treatment is among acceptable medical alternatives and when the state gives no specific justification for that intrusion other than their general interest in life.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.885" offset="1622848">We submit that the Fourteenth Amendment and the liberty guarantee there protects individuals, conscious or unconscious, from such invasion by the state, without any particularized interest for that invasion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.088" offset="12103697">--With respect to the method?</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.405" offset="12108922">No, I think not, because if I may, the second aspect that the record reveals is that Nancy and other patients at Mount Vernon have, typically, a DNR... do not resuscitate... order, applicable to them in the event of a cardiac or respiratory arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.185" offset="12196066">But this facility has never agreed to the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration, and there is a reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.575" offset="12229608">There is no consensus on this delicate issue in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.130" offset="12255835">Of the states that have living will statutes, 18 of those states, ranging geographically from Maine to Arizona, draw a distinction between nutrition and hydration, on the one hand, and other forms of treatment or care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.106" offset="12323753">So, too, Congress has drawn that distinction in the Child Abuse Amendments of 1988, and as the Missouri Supreme Court noted, the distinction is seen quite poignantly in the actions a decade ago, in the celebrated case of Karen Ann Quinlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.935" offset="12391044">In that tragic case, Karen's parents secured judicial permission in New Jersey to withdraw Karen's respirator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.740" offset="12430228">It was thought that she was respirator-dependent, but she was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.044" offset="12447469">They refused, however, to withdraw her nourishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.729" offset="12462202">The parents believed that that presented different moral issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.317" offset="12488533">And these facts place, in my judgment, in very sharp relief the Probate Court's order in this case, which is what was before the Missouri Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.125" offset="12531792">That order directs a long-term care facility, on pain of civil liability, to take the action of withdrawing food and drink from a patient who came there ten months after this accident, when she was known to be in a persistent vegetative state and was given to the care of Mount Vernon for the long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.406" offset="12632938">That is the context of the Missouri Supreme Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.560" offset="12649552">Now, as to the constitutional issues before the Court, we believe that in this highly sensitive and deeply vexing area, that the due process clause should not be interpreted to force the states and the federal government, with its many health-care facilities, to embrace a particular procedure or approach to the treatment or care of incompetent persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.394" offset="12760834">To the contrary, we believe that the due process clause should be interpreted to provide the states and the federal government with wide latitude that... wide latitude to develop approaches that reflect reasonably the values of the people, that states should not be forced to use the Massachusetts model, which Missouri has now embraced, a model of active state judicial involvement through a probate judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.981" offset="12879221">Nor, on the other hand, should they be forced to use the Minnesota model or the Arizona model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.351" offset="12904716">Those... in those models, the court is ordinarily not involved and these matters are entrusted to the decision of the health care providers and to the families.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.294" offset="12952468">The standard, we believe, that should guide this difficult area, is that of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.948" offset="12979113">Is the governmental approach, or regulation, or regime, reasonably designed to serve a legitimate state interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.054" offset="13011505">And on the evidentiary standard, what the Missouri Supreme Court did here was to follow the New York approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.141" offset="13043897">If one reads the New York opinions, as I have, in In re Eichner and most recently, in 1988, in the Westchester County Hospital case, one sees there precisely the same evidentiary standard with respect to the patient's intent, and this kind of decision will not be honored in New York with respect to withdrawing nutrition and hydration in the absence of clear and convincing proof of the patient's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.810" offset="13154551">That was also the approach of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial course... Court in the Brophy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.981" offset="13179211">There, they concluded that the evidence was powerful in Paul Brophy's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.235" offset="13204288">So, too, the New York Court of Appeals, in In re Eichner, concluded that the evidence was powerful there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.023" offset="13239397">But I believe, based on my review of the record in this case, that this case may very well have been decided precisely the same way in both New York and Massachusetts.</text>
