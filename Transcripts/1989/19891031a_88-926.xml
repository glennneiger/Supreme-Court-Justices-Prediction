            <text syncTime="1145.666" offset="4719712">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.774" offset="4736117">The military's procurement of alcoholic beverages has generated its share of controversy ever since the Congress, in 1802, included one gill, which is four ounces, of rum, whiskey or brandy in a soldier's daily ration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.018" offset="4793168">Before this Court today the issue is whether the federal government, consistent with federal law, may remain free to purchase its alcoholic beverages for resale in military base clubs and package stores from the most convenient and inexpensive sources, regardless of whether those sources are located in a base's home state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.713" offset="4867879">In our view the states regulations are constitutionally invalid for three principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.866" offset="4892538">First, Congress has made clear in Section 2488 of Title 10 that the military must remain free to buy its alcoholic beverages at the lowest available price, regardless of where the suppliers and/or distillers are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.252" offset="4954083">Here the record shows that North Dakota's regulatory efforts conflict with this federal scheme, actually thwart it, and thus violate the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.561" offset="4991281">The regulations would in effect require the military to obtain its liquor for its North Dakota facilities from less competitive in-state sources, and on this record, at an increased annual cost of more than $200,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.295" offset="6066272">At the outset, Justice Scalia mentioned before, well, what can a state do if there is this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.621" offset="6091559">Seven states in this country actually use the most efficient method, which is a tax stamp system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.430" offset="6122801">The state could require all licensed wholesalers in the state to affix tax stamps, which would actually be seals on the bottle, on every bottle of liquor that they sell.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.091" offset="6533446">And the problem is, as Mr. Spaeth said, bootlegging, the sale... the resale of untaxed liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.682" offset="6555807">Assuming that's a problem, liquor on military bases, whether it is bought from out-of-state sources or whether bought from licensed wholesalers in the state, will always be cheaper from liquor off the base in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.068" offset="6605335">And that is not only because of the source, but because liquor sold to the servicemen on the base is not subject to a retail tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.503" offset="6635114">Therefore, under the state's own terms, there is always going to be the potential... potential for diversion, of bootlegging, from the liquor on the base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.781" offset="6668133">But what happens here, the state doesn't impose any labeling requirement for liquor sold from the local wholesalers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.644" offset="7087660">What the state is doing here is the Paul case, is the Leslie Miller case, is the Public Utilities Commission case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1748.749" offset="7132068">In fact, this regulation is even worse than the regulations at issue in those cases because those cases, in Leslie Miller, Paul, and the Public Utilities Commission cases, those were general regulations that applied to anyone, any firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.993" offset="7185044">And there, those firms got caught up in the net because they did business with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.429" offset="7206778">This regulation, on its face, tells us who it is seeking to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.381" offset="7222556">It is seeking to regulate the transaction between the federal government and its suppliers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.766" offset="7432163">But there are ways to do it that have nothing to do with interfering with what states can't do, and that is regulate military procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.122" offset="7461524">In terms of the dollars, the practical effects are we wouldn't bring lawsuits if the dollars didn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.712" offset="7487856">But here the legislative record, and I mentioned before Title... Section 2488, Congress considered all these... this precise matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.178" offset="7529756">Congress has told the military, look, we want you to buy beer and wine for the bases only from in-state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.660" offset="7555670">But when it comes to liquor, we want you to buy it from wherever you can get it at the cheapest to save money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.923" offset="7580747">And we need the money because Congress doesn't fund what the profits of these sales go for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.937" offset="7600809">And it is things like child care centers, libraries, photo labs, bowling alleys, the things on the military bases that are for the servicemen's benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.855" offset="7636440">And so this is important in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.837" offset="7648352">This money is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.805" offset="7656293">Going back to the suggestion that is made in the brief, and it was mentioned here, that perhaps the military can just absorb the cost; we could just raise our prices if it costs us more to buy liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.443" offset="7698821">In fact, there is a Department of Defense regulation in deference to states and local... and other local liquor sale... entities, we will not sell liquor below 10 percent of the shelf price in any local market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.062" offset="7753260">So, the military works with an effective 10 percent profit margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.293" offset="7770187">Obviously we can't sell above the local price, one, because it makes no economic sense and, two, the entity that runs these shops now, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, by regulation, its mission is to provide cheaper goods to servicemen.</text>
