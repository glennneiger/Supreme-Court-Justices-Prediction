            <text syncTime="1916.725" offset="7811327">It was assumed by the trial court, and there could have been discovery on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.548" offset="7830658">I can give you an idea that you are correct that it would be a relatively small number, that most of the overcharges were then passed on to the customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.887" offset="7876006">Remember, we are talking about a preliminary question here of, not quite standing, but antitrust injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.151" offset="7901084">And the way we got into this was at the very beginning of the case we filed a motion for summary judgment against not the states, but against the defendants on the pass-on defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.250" offset="7945492">Because the defendants were saying you don't have a right to recover anything in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.524" offset="7962524">And so, instead of having us litigate the issue of allocation which you have raised, and try to determine well, UtiliCorp has got 2 percent of the total overcharges, whatever that number may be, the district court quite properly concluded, under the doctrine of Illinois Brick, that there should just be... an antitrust damage claim should be concentrated in the direct purchaser.</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.764" offset="8355510">Because, as you point out, if you are a residential home owner, for example, and you put more insulation in your attic, we are not going to be able to sell you as much gas in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.922" offset="8396157">It's not just an immediate downturn because we have been able to sell you gas in the past and we'll get that back, because we have lost market for the long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.386" offset="8437953">And that is particularly also true for the commercial and industrial customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.469" offset="8450282">If a home owner goes out and installs a wood burning fireplace in his house and starts burning a lot of wood, that is demand loss to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.166" offset="8489153">Now, Mr. Greenan suggested that we could go back to the utility commissions and try to get some of this margin back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.021" offset="8512558">But in fact UtiliCorp, particularly the Missouri public service division, did not have a rate case between 1983 and 1988, the major portion of the damage period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.037" offset="8548607">And we do believe that the company suffered substantial damages, and it was certainly enough to cause us to bring this suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.178" offset="8665113">And I guess the question is what incentive is enough, and what level of complexity and what level of expense is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.243" offset="8689460">Mr. Greenan pointed out that UtiliCorp dropped out of the case for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.897" offset="8708059">I wasn't privy to that decision; I don't know why it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.828" offset="8719762">But I suggest that part of the reason may well have been the concern that you just raised, Justice O'Connor, that when you don't know how much of it you are going to be allowed to recover, and when you know there is going to be tremendous expense right up front in the litigation, litigating about whether you can even be involved in the case, that is a tremendous disincentive that this Court frowned upon in Illinois Brick, and should continue to frown upon, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.674" offset="8811086">The question that Justice Scalia raised about who recovers for the industrial and commercial customers should be a significant one on the Court's mind, for, after all, there is some inconsistency here in the states' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.307" offset="8885691">They say well, when it comes to residential customers, we or the consumers themselves, can sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.871" offset="8907948">But when it comes to industrial and commercial customers, then the utilities can sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.184" offset="8925189">As Justice Posner suggested, because perhaps the utilities ate some of the overcharges, didn't pass along all the overcharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.579" offset="8950789">But the fact is that the industrial and commercial customers of these two parties, UtiliCorp and KPL, have not sued, probably, I would submit, in reliance upon Illinois Brick and the fact that they would be entitled under the utility regulatory scheme to get back a large part of their damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.688" offset="9015154">So we have a question of equity and justice here for those customers whose claims would now be barred by the statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.283" offset="9209610">I want to point out, if you... if the Court would like to discuss the argument that Section 4(c) allows the state attorneys general to bring this case, that it was not raised in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.740" offset="9255376">It was not presented in the certiorari petition before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.503" offset="9270423">Moreover, I would suggest the Court has already rejected that argument in footnote 14 of Illinois Brick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.405" offset="9290067">Indeed it would be an odd statutory construction, if Section 4(c) is based on Section 4, to have a rule like in Illinois Brick, that an indirect purchaser cannot sue under Section 4, but under Section 4(c) a state may sue on behalf of that indirect purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.859" offset="9363837">And indeed, the statute doesn't make any sense that way, for if you allow a consumer to opt out under Section 4(c), but you don't give him the right to sue under Section 4, it's just internally inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.725" offset="9407304">Apparently there was the assumption of some congressman in 1976 that Illinois Brick might have come out the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.660" offset="9443040">But I think the states have recognized, by their efforts to go back to Congress and get Illinois Brick changed, that in fact Congress did not authorize in Section 4(c) parens patriae suits on behalf of indirect purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.581" offset="9498733">Surely the proof that Congress has not acted shows there is no strong sentiment in Congress for changing the direct purchaser rule that this court enunciated in Illinois Brick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.648" offset="9534991">In this case, I contend that the purposes of the antitrust laws is... are best served by concentrating the recovery in the direct purchaser, instead of splintering the recovery among industrial customers, commercial customers, the state attorney generals or any consumers who may bring their own cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.155" offset="9637077">The incentive should be maximized, so the deterrent will be maximized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.998" offset="9656408">I point out that one of the concerns in Illinois Brick was that the direct purchaser should have the best knowledge, and that is... does appear to be what happened in this case, in that the Kansas Power and Light Company, the direct purchaser, did the investigation and filed the antitrust suit, and the states, and for that matter UtiliCorp, piggybacked in on KPL's work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.555" offset="9758704">I point out that this is a case in which the utilities have gotten it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.039" offset="9776571">They have sued for treble damages to protect their market, and to some extent, I suppose, out of a sense of public service duty that a public service commission has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.356" offset="9813874">But if this Court were to take away 50 to 95 percent of this recovery, I would ask how much of an enthusiastic plaintiff will a utility be the next time around, the next time there's an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.873" offset="9859954">I would submit that the ruling of the Tenth Circuit should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.629" offset="9886913">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.013" offset="9928500">With respect, I believe Mr. Greenan has misformulated the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.518" offset="9950547">The rule of Illinois Brick is not that the direct purchaser is the proper party to sue unless it is easy to demonstrate that there has been no absorption of the overcharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.925" offset="10000180">The rule in Illinois Brick is as follows, that with a cost-plus contract the purchaser is insulated from any decrease in its sales as a result of attempting to pass on the overcharge, because its customer is committed to buying a fixed quantity, regardless of price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.728" offset="10067366">Even if it were the case that the regulatory framework in which this case comes before the Court solved the problem of apportionment, that would only be the tip of the iceberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.145" offset="10109058">Illinois Brick is not simply about the apportionment of overcharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.018" offset="10124522">Instead, Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe stem from a longer tradition in which this Court has uniformly held that an injured direct purchaser is entitled to sue for the entire overcharge, regardless of whether and to what extent that direct purchaser passes on the overcharge to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.961" offset="10204248">It is that tradition that Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick dealt with when it adverted to the possibility that there might be a cost-plus exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.810" offset="10239670">Now, one thing is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.800" offset="10247611">If there is a cost-plus exception, it does not cover this case, because, as Petitioners freely concede, the direct purchaser in this case was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.846" offset="10287840">It suffered the loss of profits as a result of having to pass on an overcharge, to whatever extent it did, to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.753" offset="10319500">And so, what is clear beyond, I think, contradiction, is that if there is to be an exception to cover this case, it will be a new exception, an exception that departs from the tradition that has always held that an injured direct purchaser, injured in any form, injured by the overcharge or injured by lost profits, and lost profits are not contravened in this case, is entitled to sue for the entire overcharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2599.810" offset="10543631">But that was anticipated for a reason, anticipated because the Court concluded, as it had in Hanover Shoe, that locating and maximizing the incentive in the direct purchaser is the best policy for the antitrust laws, seeking the maximum deterrence at the most efficient price.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.588" offset="11038808">First of all, you are going to have litigation about whether the regulation in fact requires the utility to pass it on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.223" offset="11169316">What looks like a pass-through may be an increase for other reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.044" offset="11244653">The complication of litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2779.708" offset="11263252">It's going to come back because you are going to increase the number of litigants in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.052" offset="11280597">You are going to increase the kinds of damages they are seeking.</text>

            <text syncTime="2790.107" offset="11304839">The direct purchasers will sue either for the lost profits and, as Petitioners have conceded this morning, some portion of the overcharge for unrepresented customers that the state's parens patriae can't... can't represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.677" offset="11359174">Lost profits are very hard to calculate, because they require you to prove the overcharge, and then calculate the effect of the overcharge on the demand curve, how inelastic or elastic is the demand, the very thing this Court wanted to get away from in Illinois Brick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.409" offset="11422077">As a consequence of the proliferation of parties and the complication of the damage theories, you will do a couple of other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.907" offset="11520088">But as a practical matter, because the overcharge will always be greater than, or at worst equal to, the lost profits, they will tend in the aggregate to seek only the overcharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.266" offset="11561466">And as a result, the more complicated inquiry for lost profits will in the main wash away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.342" offset="11585812">There will also not be competing claims for the same total recovery, a concern that this Court articulated in ARC America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.418" offset="11614129">You will not have two or more categories of plaintiffs suing over a common Federal pot under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.382" offset="11641923">And that competing claim, and the proliferation of theories and parties that will inevitably ensue, and only gets worse under Petitioners' theory, is what is going to ultimately dilute the intended incentive on the direct purchasers to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.024" offset="11704513">What is more, finally, I think, if you open the door the crack that they seek this morning, there will be many more exceptions brought to your doorstep.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.052" offset="11744637">If today it's 100 percent regulation, tomorrow it will be a 95 percent regulation, because in theory there is no greater reason why the 95 percent pass-through plaintiffs shouldn't be in court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.018" offset="11796464">And it is precisely that concern, I suggest, that caused this Court to hesitate to even say whether there is any cost-plus exception at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.653" offset="11831050">In each of the Court's cases the suggestion has been that there might be such an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.836" offset="11847768">And I think that hesitation makes a good deal of sense, because in a case in which it's not required to reach that result, it ought not to be reached.</text>
