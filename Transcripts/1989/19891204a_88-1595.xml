            <label>Mr. Richard P. McElroy</label>
            <text syncTime="20.767" offset="221780">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.808" offset="234005">We ask the Court to reverse a decision of the Third Circuit court of appeals applying the post-judgment interest amendments in 1982 retroactive to a judgment entered against Kaiser prior to the effective date of those amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.732" offset="301715">The decision conflicts with prior decisions of the second court... Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Ninth circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.828" offset="338077">It conflicts with six years of prior practice within the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.459" offset="356572">It conflicts with the practice in the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.783" offset="369946">And it conflicts with the interpretation given to the statute by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, which has been charge with the obligation of administering that statute by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.751" offset="421773">The Petition also raises the question whether the court of appeals erroneously ruled that judgment can run from the date of verdict, as opposed to the date of the entry of judgment, as the plain language of the statute mandates.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.140" offset="483318">This case comes to this Court as a collateral proceeding for an award of interest in an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.275" offset="511844">The Plaintiff ultimately prevailed on the theory of liability under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and recovered a judgment for treble damages in the amount of $9.6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.372" offset="564297">That judgment was originally entered on December 4, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.138" offset="587285">However, the judgment was vacated on Kaiser's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and on appeal, the court of appeals reversed and directed that the judgment be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.646" offset="641306">After this Court denied certiorari, with Justice White dissenting, the judgment was reinstated on July 2, 1986, and Kaiser paid the judgment in full the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.725" offset="697626">The Plaintiffs then asked the district court for an award of interest on that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.099" offset="723122">That proceeding took on more complications than normally would occur for the calculation of interest, which should be, under normal circumstances, a simple task.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.828" offset="774113">It was complicated by the procedural history of the case, but also by the fact that after the original entry of judgment on December 4, 1981, Congress, on April 2, 1982, enacted the Federal Courts Improvement Act, which, among other things, amended the post-judgment interest statute in Section 1961 by changing the rates of interest applicable to judgments in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.455" offset="884559">Under the prior statute, interest carried... judgments carried interest at state law rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.771" offset="913816">And under the amendment, interest was keyed to treasury bill rates, which are auctioned from time to time, and therefore change.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.599" offset="953208">The Plaintiffs asked the district court to award interest from August 22 of 1979, not the date of the judgment on December 4, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.025" offset="1006812">The August 22, 1979 date was the date that a prior judgment had been entered, but which had been vacated by the district court because the district court found that Plaintiffs had failed to prove its case for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.656" offset="1061355">It found that the verdict that underlie that judgment was the product of speculation and conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.360" offset="1084239">It vacated the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.930" offset="1090508">It was never reinstated, and there was never an appeal taken from that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.124" offset="1115272">Kaiser asked the court to award interest from July 2, 1986, the date that the judgment was entered on remand from the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.160" offset="1159367">We argued, in the alternative, that the court could award interest from December 4, 1981, the original judgment date, but that if it did so, the interest that it carried should be at the interest under the prior statute rather than by the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.124" offset="1235226">The district court held, however, that interest shall run from the date of verdict, which was December 2, 1981, rather than from the date of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.084" offset="1287053">It found itself bound by prior Third Circuit precedent in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.966" offset="1306593">The court also ruled that it would not apply the amendments... retroactively, because to do so would result in manifest injustice to Kaiser and would be contrary to legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.556" offset="1361032">A divided panel of the Third Circuit reversed the retroactivity holding of the district court, but affirmed the remainder of the opinion, and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.552" offset="1405022">This case presents a question of statutory construction, and as a result of that, congressional intent is the first inquiry of this Court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="327.171" offset="1447445">I would think the language of the statute might be the first inquiry.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. McElroy</label>
            <text syncTime="333.222" offset="1471687">Precisely, in determining legislative intent, Your Honor, the first question is what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.228" offset="1495719">The statute, as I said, was part of the Federal Courts Improvement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.170" offset="1511393">In Section 402 of that act, Congress expressly stated that unless otherwise specified, the provisions of the act shall take effect on October 1, 1982, six months after the date of the enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.302" offset="1584013">This Court has, on at least three prior occasions, found that the existence of an effective date, and a delayed effective date in particular, is evidence that Congress did not intend that statute to apply retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.889" offset="1638348">And, in fact, it makes sense, because if Congress had intended that judgments entered prior to the effective date, and even prior to the enactment date, were to be governed by the amendment, there would be simply no reason whatsoever to delay the effective date for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.314" offset="1720059">Congress even stated in the legislative history that the reason that it was delaying the effective date was to permit a transition period for the Bar and the business community to become familiar with its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.244" offset="1775752">Again, a purpose that would be wholly meaningless if it were to be applied to judgments entered two, three years prior to the date of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.498" offset="1808771">In addition, when Congress wanted this act to apply to pending cases, it knew exactly how to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.904" offset="1842417">In Section 403 of the act, under the title effect on pending cases, there is not one reference to the amendment to the post-judgment interest statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.022" offset="1882854">There are, however, other provisions of the act which Congress wanted to have an effect on pending cases, and it knew how to express its intent in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.966" offset="1914619">Finally, the statutory scheme that Congress adopted under the act, and which carries forward the statutory scheme under the prior statute, is to award interest as of the date of the entry of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.015" offset="1970835">Once judgment is entered, interest remains constant throughout post trial, post judgment proceedings, through appeals, until the judgment is paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.796" offset="2093924">Well, it is... it is no doubt true that if the judgment is overturned there is no obligation on the part of the defendant to pay the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.122" offset="2131226">But the subject matter of this statute is the rate of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.294" offset="2151915">And the rate of interest is set as of the date of entry of judgment, and does not change, no matter what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.329" offset="2176053">The mere fact that the obligation is extinguished by the fact that the court overturns the judgment should not... does not change that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.606" offset="2213146">And it is... and, what I was going to say, Your Honor, was that Congress quite purposely chose that, because it had a very substantial countervailing concern about the reliance interest of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.884" offset="2266332">It wanted defendants to be able to know what the financial impact would be on the exercise of their post judgment remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.178" offset="2295484">And to... under those circumstances it is implausible, I suggest, to ascribe to Congress an intent that it would change the post-judgment interest on a judgment entered prior to its effective date by retroactive application of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="851.393" offset="3544346">In the absence of legislative intent, the Court has before it two competing presumptions of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.809" offset="3597950">Under the Court's decision in Bradley v. Richmond School Board, the Court has said that courts are to apply the law in effect at the time that they render the decision, unless to do so will result in manifest injustice.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.010" offset="3654792">Last term this Court reaffirmed the long-standing principle of statutory construction that statutory enactments will not be construed retroactively unless their language requires that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.918" offset="3706410">The courts below have applied the Bradley standard to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.043" offset="3730965">The district and the court of appeals also applied the Bradley standard, and we believe that it was seriously flawed in its analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.798" offset="3769940">And I would like to go through that at this point, because obviously if the Court were to find, to agree with us, that its analysis was flawed, it does not have to deal with the additional issue of these competing presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.794" offset="3809959">Under Bradley, this Court stated that courts must look to three factors to determine whether or not manifest injustice exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.645" offset="3857293">The nature of the parties, the nature of their rights, and to evaluate the impact that the change of law has on those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.750" offset="3889790">The first element, the nature of the parties, simply requires the court to identify whether they are private parties, and that their private interests are at stake by the retroactive application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.637" offset="3945274">This factor derives from Chief Justice Marshall's language in the Schooner Peggy case, that courts ought to struggle hard against a retroactive construction in cases... in private cases between private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.349" offset="4008177">Chief Justice Marshall went on to say, however, that if the statute touches upon a matter of great national concern... in that case it was a treaty between France and the United States... if a statute touches upon a matter of great national concern, then the private interests of private parties should give way to that national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.591" offset="4097097">In applying the Bradley and Schooner Peggy principles to this case, the court of appeals acknowledged that this was private individuals involved in this case, but then stated that because the underlying merits claim was an antitrust case, that it took on a matter of public interest, and therefore there was no impediment to the retroactive application of the post-judgment interest statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.241" offset="4207752">We believe that the court identified the wrong statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.242" offset="4223739">If a statute is to apply retroactively because it involves a matter of great national concern, then it is the post-judgment interest statute that the court should have looked to to determine whether or not it involves a matter of great national concern, thereby justifying retroactive application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.915" offset="4306391">It has not been seriously, as a matter of fact it has not been contended at all by anybody here, that the post-judgment interest statute involves the matter of great national concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.882" offset="4342335">The second Bradley... standard was the nature of the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.949" offset="4374518">The court of appeals again identified the wrong thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.880" offset="4394266">It said that the Plaintiff's right to receive interest was not mature and unconditional because there had been no final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.534" offset="4424882">And therefore there was no impediment to the retroactive application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.178" offset="4447452">But the change in law did not affect the right to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.794" offset="4469917">The change in law affect... affected the rate that would be applied to the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.106" offset="4487158">And the rate, as I have indicated, was fixed and became mature and unconditional when the judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.503" offset="4524774">Moreover, it seems to me that in determining manifest injustice you should attempt to identify the interests that are adversely affected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.149" offset="4571377">Clearly it was not the Plaintiff's interests that were adversely affected by the... the retroactive application of this statute, but it was the... it was Kaiser's rights to a certain... to pay... Kaiser's obligation to pay at 6 percent, Kaiser's reliance interest on that being the rate of interest that would be applied to that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.344" offset="4656118">Once having identified the appropriate rights, having fixed as of the date of the entry of judgment, it is clear that those rights, and the obligation that the statute imposed, was mature and unconditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.341" offset="4708154">The third Bradley factor involves the analysis of the impact of the change in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.946" offset="4742531">In this case it was a $7 million impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.539" offset="4756951">The court of appeals stated the once the law was changed it was not an unforeseen circumtance, and not an unforeseen obligation, that Kaiser would have to pay a higher rate of interest, because the state may be applied retroactively to the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.522" offset="4836885">We... this is circular reasoning, and it is a misconstruction of Bradley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.608" offset="4857156">In Bradley, which involved the statute that was changed which awarded attorneys' fees in a school desegregation case, what the court focused in... xx, was the fact that there were two independent grounds for the award of attorneys' fees in school desegregation cases, separate and apart from the change in law in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.790" offset="4937927">Therefore, the Court held, that even as, from the beginning of the case when the complaint was filed, it was not an unforeseen obligation that the school board would have to pay attorneys' fees to the plaintiff, even though that statute did not come into existence until after the entry of final judgment in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.613" offset="5013264">That's simply not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.325" offset="5024026">Therefore, the court of appeals picked the wrong statute, it identified the wrong rights and misapplied the impact standard of Bradley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.504" offset="5088810">And for that reason the judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.005" offset="5098737">But in any event we suggest that the Bradley standard of statutory construction ought to be reconsidered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.513" offset="5140846">The Bowen presumption that the statutes are... will not be construed to apply retroactively unless their language requires that result, in our view is a better standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.470" offset="5184627">The manifest injustice standard, although if all of... all of the courts applied it in the proper fashion and applied it equally would have the same impact, the reality of it is that judges do often disagree as to whether or not manifest injustice exists in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.810" offset="5254008">And you need look no further than this case in order to find proof of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.835" offset="5278146">Two judges found that it would be manifestly unjust to apply this statute retroactively to Kaiser, and two judges held that it would not be manifestly unjust.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.707" offset="5405623">It simply points out the fact that the manifest injustice standard results in inconsistent and often conflicting statutory obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.019" offset="6746854">It is wrong, Your Honors, that someone should be able to delay for 14 years full restitution from the date they destroyed another's business, lose every appeal in the courts, and still end up having the jury's award against them reduced by two thirds, and the cost of their long and losing defenses subsidized by the winning and wronged party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.418" offset="6860435">Yet that is precisely what the Defendant petitioner seeks at the hands of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.313" offset="6944026">The issue in this case, Your Honors, is who is entitled to some $18.6 million, which is the undisputed value of the cost of money to this Defendant from 1979, when the liability verdict was first entered against him, and never thereafter disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.858" offset="7046217">And from 1979 on that is the only finding of liability, and the 1981 recalculation was based solely on the 1980... on the 1979 judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.188" offset="8567484">Now, what Rule 37 says is that where the court... reinstates, where the court reinstates an earlier judgment, it shall give appropriate instructions with respect to interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.626" offset="8741251">For example, if I may cite, and we cite it in our brief, Your Honors, the case of Young v. Godbe, one of the earliest Supreme Court decision cases on the question of interest, decided in 1872, and there, in a unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Davis for the Court, had to decide whether or not the Court had the power to award a rate of interest where there was no statute or any authority for them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.370" offset="8892239">And what the Court said, it was a case involving the territory of Utah, and what the Court there said was this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.002" offset="9938808">And thus the question of appropriate interest, as was so in any number of these other cases that we have cited, the question was does the court itself have power, does the court have to look to a delegation from the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.343" offset="10012160">And let me read to you, if I may, sir, from the Billings case, which Justice Blackmun, Your Honor, will remember, because you cited that in the Ralston Purina decision that you had when you were sitting on the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.064" offset="10079034">And... let me find it here, here it is, in Billings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.399" offset="10104320">In Billings, Your Honors... Billings was a case where the court had to determine whether or not there was... whether or not interest would run on the failure to pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.357" offset="10164193">And the failure to pay taxes backdated a number of years until the final decision in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.273" offset="10191883">And the two questions the Court had to consider was one, whether or not there would be interest, whether or not you could have... whether the taxes were properly imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.291" offset="10235977">And secondly whether interest would run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.111" offset="10243187">And there the court held that both you could collect the delinquent taxes, and going back to the date when the delinquent taxes were first due, interest would also run from that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.254" offset="10307762">Now, there was no specific statute that would have covered the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.179" offset="10327511">And here is what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.179" offset="10335452">Thus as to the necessity for a statute, it was long ago here decided, and I am referring to this Court, in view of the true conception of interest, that a statute was not necessary to compel its payment where, in accordance with the principles of equity and justice in the enforcement of an obligation interest should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.977" offset="10442658">Now, that was precisely the situation that Justice Blackmun was faced with when he was on the Eighth Circuit, where, in the Ralston Purina case, it was a case where the defendant had won on a counter-claim in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.348" offset="10512144">The case went up to the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.450" offset="10524578">The appellate court reversed, sent it back for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.805" offset="10549969">On a new trial the defendant again won.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.627" offset="10569300">So if this was the first time they had a formal judgment, the earlier judgment had been taken away.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.498" offset="14156748">Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that this was complicated, and if there is any area that should be uncomplicated, it is the interest that judgment should carry, so that we avoid prolonging litigation that is prolonged already forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.611" offset="14233235">Justice Scalia was quite right that the Billings case was a pre-judgment interest case, that that case involved delay damages that would be part of the recovery by the government for delinquent taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.803" offset="14289973">But seven years later this Court... this Court stated, in Pierce v. United States, that there is no common law for post-judgment interest, and that in the absence of statute, interest... excuse me, judgments will not carry interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.492" offset="14352771">Rule 37 and Section 1961 have to be read in harmony with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.266" offset="14379834">There is no question that this... the interest that is sought to be recovered in this case, is on a district court judgment, not on a court of appeals judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.943" offset="14418495">For that reason we think that the court below's judgment ought to be reversed.</text>
