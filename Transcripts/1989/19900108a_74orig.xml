South Carolina in 1922, and the Court further explicated that boundary and determined that the boundary is the geographic middle of the boundary stream, irrespective of the navigation channel or thalweg of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.027" offset="1191979">The Court also stated in 1922 that the boundary stream may be narrow and shallow and insignificant, as compared to the main body of the river, but that doesn't matter if it is the northernmost branch or stream of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.781" offset="5450983">The closest case is Arkansas v. Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.873" offset="5463313">It is really the only case we found where there is an island... this is Arkansas v. Tennessee in 1940, where there was an island in the river which was clearly in Arkansas by the boundary document, but prior to the admission of Arkansas into the Union, it became affixed to the Tennessee shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.286" offset="5536978">And from then on there was a universal treatment of that land as being in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.968" offset="5555786">Generations of people grew up on that island; they were educated in schools on the island, operated by Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.373" offset="5581386">They voted in Tennessee elections; they were married by justices of the peace in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.744" offset="5598836">So there really was a course of conduct, universal treatment of the land as being in Tennessee, without any objection by the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.972" offset="5639796">Of course in this case, Georgia did not acquiesce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.943" offset="5655679">Georgia went into court in 1953, the first time that Georgia was aware that anybody was claiming that the land was in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.969" offset="5691728">Georgia went into court and intervened, claiming Georgia dominion, sovereignty and title over Barnwell Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.136" offset="5728404">The case was thrown out by the district judge for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.079" offset="5744181">The case was appealed by the United States and by Georgia to the Fifth Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit ruled there is, there can be no doubt that Barnwell Island is in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.324" offset="5777200">We certainly think that goes also to refute a general conviction that Barnwell Island is in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.249" offset="5804890">Back to the maps of the United States, in 1911, 1920, 1932, 1957, 1959, 1970, 1971, 1974, these are official published maps, circulated maps by the agencies of the United States, without ever any protest by the State of South Carolina that the map... they contended the boundary was incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.414" offset="7409540">And it was only a few years after 1787 that South Carolina granted this property the first time to Hezekiah Roberts, in 1795, a grant which expired because it wasn't recorded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.136" offset="7656449">Now, Georgia, as I said, after 18... 1787, never made any act of attempt of a granting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.956" offset="7715695">And when the South Carolina granted the islands to Archibald Smith in 1813, it granted three islands, described as islands, as marsh islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.922" offset="7759581">Incidentally, when the first grant occurred by Georgia in 1760, it was only described as two marsh islands, and there were only two in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.876" offset="7791346">The tax books in Georgia perhaps show payment of taxes in 1825, 1830 and 1831.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.282" offset="7824991">And described in that is land marsh, land marsh and three marsh islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.485" offset="7845785">May or may not have been these islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.969" offset="7855711">But the grant by which it would had to have been if it were at all was the 1813 grant, of course, of the Barnwells from South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.692" offset="7894581">Had Georgia even brought this suit in 1900, the claims of the Barnwells would have been foreclosed by acquiescence and prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.478" offset="7929795">And further, South Carolina in this century sold these Barnwell Islands for non-payment of taxes in the 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.284" offset="7965008">And the commission in South Carolina which acquired them then subsequently conveyed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.768" offset="7982980">And the chain of title is consistent from 1813 down till this very day in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.444" offset="8009625">And there is no chain of title in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.155" offset="8020492">And Georgia's argument that no one could have seen them in exercising this sovereignty cannot be true because of the unobstructed view of 500 or 600 yards away and because of the intense interest of people in rice plantations and in farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.663" offset="8082559">The Barnwells were used for rice plantations and planting for decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.457" offset="8101680">And these dike fields and all are shown, easily are visible, cannot be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.843" offset="8127280">Rice lands were extremely valuable, nothing more valuable in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.773" offset="8142954">They were as prominent and valuable as a 10-story building would be today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.477" offset="8157791">No one thought that the Barnwells were ungranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.859" offset="8171270">No one appeared in Georgia and said give me a grant, and no one in Georgia said we have got untaxed land out there, the Barnwells.</text>
