            <text syncTime="106.566" offset="570439">If rule 40... if the evidence is inadmissible, as the Third Circuit alternatively held under a straight 404(b) analysis, then when the court goes to the harmless error standard, it would apply the statutory harmless error standard, as did the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.824" offset="627490">Now, not... we're not conceding that the Third Circuit correctly applied that standard, but we do concede that that would be the proper standard to apply if it's a rule 404(b) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.192" offset="672943">The cert petition basically raises the issue that the Third Circuit applied the wrong harmless error standard; that, in fact, they were... should have applied the standard mandated by Chapman v. California, because, indeed, the evidence was not only admiss... inadmissible pursuant to rule 404(b), but it was a violation of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.481" offset="778060">Let... let me... let me put it this way, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.543" offset="790390">I think that now that the court has the entire case, it would certainly have the power to review that and decide on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.289" offset="825289">As far as the cert petition itself, were... were we merely to have raised that issue before the court, what we simply would have been asking the court to do was... would be just factually review a harmless error determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.347" offset="873564">I... I would say this, it is our position that the evidence is inadmissible to a straightforward application of rule 404(b); and that, in fact, the Third Circuit, while applying the right standard, nonetheless, we disagree with their factual conclusion as to whether or not it was still harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.288" offset="945348">But if this court were to hold that yes, indeed, the evidence is inadmissible under rule 404(b), and yes, indeed, it's harmless error under the statutory standard, then the court would still have to go to the constitutional issue, because it would have to then look to see if it's a violation of the Constitution, and was it indeed harmless error under that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.732" offset="1023089">So, I guess in answer to your question, if the court decides to avoid the constitutional issue or not reach the constitutional issue by merely applying rule 404(b) analysis, then we would agree you don't have to reach it if, in fact, you also conclude that the Third Circuit wrongfully applied the harmless error standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.586" offset="2454494">Clearly the acquittal, when viewed in a very technical sense, merely signifies that there was a reasonable doubt, while the standard which the government had to bear to admit the other crime's evidence pursuant to the Huddleston decision would be a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.960" offset="2523980">And clearly this court in... in the civil forfeiture and penalty cases, which it has decided following acquittals, where it has basically said that the mere fact of an acquittal does not bar a subsequent civil forfeiture proceeding, has alluded to the burden of proof being different in the two proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.845" offset="4531543">--I suggest that... that the government's theory that the jury acquitted on the basis that two individuals came with a mask and a gun and a shot was fired in the ceiling, and that was proffered and... by the government lawyer and argued in the admissability of the evidence, clearly defies ration and reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.227" offset="4605103">And I would also point out to the court that the... the defendant was not only acquitted of robbery, he was acquitted in the Vena Henry case of burglary; he was acquitted of assault; and perhaps most importantly of all, he was acquitted of weapons violations, where he was charged with possession of a weapon during a commission of a felony, and he was acquitted of the lesser-included offense of possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.024" offset="4704264">Now, had the jury even decided on this basis that the government conjures up for us, they still would have had to have found he possessed the... the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.953" offset="4752016">And they acquitted him on that basis, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.355" offset="4761629">So I suggest... and also in the record there is... in the volume of September 23rd and September 24th, at page 60 and 61, there is evidence to the effect, when the United States... the assistant U.S. attorney was arguing concerning the admissability of the piece of evidence, that the defendant had denied his involvement in the Vena Henry case when he had first been arrested in connection with that, and that denial had been introduced in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.104" offset="4868627">So, when you couple that with his denial in this trial, the lack of impeachment, and when you factor in the Ashe's injunction that a reviewing court, in attempting to reconstruct the basis of the verdict, should not leave its common sense at home, that I suggest to you that perhaps maybe we even have carried the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.709" offset="4950965">And if we haven't, if the court puts that burden on us, then we would suggest a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.122" offset="4972698">If I could just address one other matter in regard to the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.156" offset="4988790">The lower court... Ashe doesn't really tell us who... who bears the burden, but the lower courts, as the government cites in their brief, pretty much assume that burden should be on the party opposing the admissability of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.295" offset="5041348">I suggest that that doctrine perhaps conflicts with prior decisions of this court, too, especially the line of cases, and I believe it begins with the Fung Foo case, that basically say, if a jury finds an acquittal, even if it's on a total... or I think Fung Foo involved a judge entering a judgement of acquittal... on a totally erroneous basis, and the reviewing court can see that the judge should not have entered a judgement of acquittal, nonetheless, that's the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.725" offset="5159108">Now, what that says is that the risk of... of an acquittal on a improper basis, the Constitution puts that risk on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.452" offset="5197978">And I suggest that a continuation of that principle would have put the burden the government here, because the risk of a reviewing court wrongfully deciding what the basis of that acquittal was, should rest on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.192" offset="5260986">The... the problems that we... that we have to address here is that part... the protections that double jeopardy is designed for, and even due process, and that this court has always showed great solicitude for, is protecting the rights of innocent people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.383" offset="5785734">But the language that I'm recalling to mind is the Civil War case of Ex parte Garland, which was cited, I think, last term by this court in the Arkansas case of Lockhart v. Nielson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.643" offset="5838710">And the issue there was what the effect of a pardon was where the attorney had... I think there had been a oath of allegiance to the Union, and he was from Arkansas, and when Arkansas seceded, he had gone with Arkansas, and then he wanted to come back before this court and practice, and Congress had passed an act saying he couldn't practice, I believe, unless you took this oath that you had never, essentially, been against the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.069" offset="5936408">And he argued that he had indeed, as I think President Lincoln had given him a pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.553" offset="5958351">And that issue came before the court, and the court said a pardon reaches the punishment prescribed for the offense and the guilt of the offender, and when the pardon is full, it releases the punishment and blocks out the existence of guilt, so that in the eye of the law, the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.553" offset="6018432">Now I would suggest that if a pardon is treated in that manner, where a jury or... and that wasn't the factual situation there, but if a... if a pardon is treated as innocence, where a jury has returned a guilty verdict, clearly, functionally speaking, where a jury has come back and said not guilty, that we're not asking the court to go too far, at least functionally, to treat that as innocent, at least in the context of not having to be retried again in a subsequent criminal case, where the jury asks... is asked to draw an inference of guilt based on that conduct of which you were acquitted, and ask, based on that inference of guilt, to infer that you are guilty of the instant offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.988" offset="6216127">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.803" offset="6247369">Our essential position is that the reasoning of two of this court's decisions require the conclusion that Mrs. Henry's testimony was admissible, notwithstanding the prior acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.391" offset="6289688">First, in Huddleston v. United States, the court confirmed what the rules provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.316" offset="6313407">The admissability of evidence in federal cases is governed by a standard of proof that is effectively the same one that a trial judge employs when it determines whether to send a case to a jury in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.453" offset="6365965">Evidence is admissable if the facts on which its relevance depends are supported by proof sufficient to suppor their being found by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.201" offset="6412986">And that is the standard that applied to the admissability of Mrs. Henry's testimony in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.157" offset="6440780">Second, in United States v. Eighty-Nine Firearms, the court held that for purposes of collateral estoppel, a judgement of acquittal in a criminal case establishes only the existence of reasonable doubt on whatever issues are decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.918" offset="6503892">Such a judgement does not, therefore, foreclose relitigation of those issues in a proceeding in which they are subject to a lower standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.705" offset="6546942">It follows, we believe, that Mr. Dowling's acquittal did not foreclose the trial judge in this case from making the finding necessary to admit her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.691" offset="6590932">In view of the questions that came up about the applicability of the rules of evidence to this situation, it may be helpful to review that aspect of the case briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.560" offset="6642445">First, there is a general rule, perhaps the most important of the federal rules of evidence, which is that all relevant evidence is presumptively admissable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.078" offset="6688525">That rule appears to reflect the assumption, which experience suggests is well-founded, that the best guarantee of reliable outcomes in any trial is to permit both parties to marshal whatever evidence they can that tends to make the facts in issue more or less likely, and to offer that evidence to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.142" offset="6772744">Second, under the rules, judgements are, with a very few specified exceptions, hearsay, completely inadmissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.109" offset="6812659">Those exceptions are... are inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.361" offset="6829587">Again, the assumption appears to be that when a matter that has been the subject of a prior judgement is an issue in a second trial, those exceptions are inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.818" offset="6867412">The issue is to be resolved by allowing the trier in the second case the same opportunity to see all of the evidence that's available, as was available to the trier in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.145" offset="6908790">Each jury is then free to draw its own conclusions about the weight and probative value of that evidence, depending on the issues in dispute and the other evidence that is available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.688" offset="6994889">And our position is that when one reviews their rationale, it appears that they accorded the judgement the same effect, in terms of the rules of evidence that they had concluded, with respect to collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.999" offset="7060196">I forget their precise language, but, in effect, it was, that if a jury has determined a fact in a prior proceeding, a second jury should not be allowed to find that fact in a second proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.321" offset="7117456">And that, in effect, is collateral estoppel reframed, in terms of the rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.344" offset="7145564">We believe that there was a mistake made in all of the court of appeals holdings, which was to assign too much effect to the judgement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.385" offset="7261756">It has concluded that, as a matter of federal common law, I suppose, the collateral estoppel extends in addition to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.132" offset="7300731">So that we believe that the Third Circuit misapplied the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and that it would be unwarranted a fortiori to extend to Ashe v. Swenson to this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.207" offset="9952996">The difference in the burdens of proof and the fact that under the rules of evidence, a judgement is an all-or-nothing proposition; it either forecloses the evidence when the conditions for collateral estoppel are present, or it has no place at all in the trial if it doesn't reach that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.216" offset="10009002">Your Honor, if the court... please... we are also... in terms of whether it makes any sense to extend Ashe, I... we believe that the reasoning of Ashe itself limits the reach of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.480" offset="10094057">Justice Stewart indicated that he saw no distinction for constitutional terms between the case in Ashe v. Swenson in a case in which Mr. Ashe had been tried a second time for robbing the same person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.029" offset="10144316">And therefore, we believe that under the... that the case establishes its own reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.772" offset="10167304">But if it were an open question whether to extend Ashe, there also have been some developments in this court's cases, which we believe would... would urge heavily against that extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.141" offset="10208787">In Standefer v. United States, the court addressed those considerations that make it particularly... that call for particular caution in extending collateral estoppel, the effect of a judgement in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.041" offset="10268346">Those grounds include the fact that in a criminal case, the government does not have access to many of the means that other litigants have to protect themselves against irrational verdicts or verdicts involving lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.123" offset="10336682">The record in this case suggests that this might be that kind of case, a situation in which a man carrying a gun and... and wearing a mask was acquitted, and the trial judge thought that his presence in the house had not been seriously contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.135" offset="10400734">But the government had no opportunity in that earlier trial to make a motion for a directed verdict, to file a post-trial motion for a new trial or a judgement notwithstanding the verdict, to take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.834" offset="10451516">And under the black letter laws of... black letter rules of collateral estoppel that apply in the civil context, the absence of those procedures would be a sufficient reason for denying collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.414" offset="10505851">In Standefer, the court relied on those concerns in refusing to extend the doctrine to permit offensive collateral estoppel against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.709" offset="10547020">And we think those concerns are just as forceful a reason not to extend Ashe v. Swenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.824" offset="10571471">In addition, it should be noted that in the civil context, at least, collateral estoppel serves primarily the function of judicial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.633" offset="10626746">The notion is that one full and fair opportunity at an issue is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.468" offset="10650047">The courts have enough to do without rehearing the same issue over and over again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.518" offset="10702292">The primary interest is in seeing that each charge is litigated fully and fairly, and particularly in view of the absence of remedies to protect the government against irrational verdicts; verdicts based on lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.090" offset="10768538">We think that the court should be quite cautious in extending the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.586" offset="10794556">Ashe doesn't require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.175" offset="10800826">We believe it has its own limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.747" offset="10807200">But even if it were an open question it would not be a good idea, given the Standefer decision and the considerations that have been addressed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.480" offset="10838129">I'd like to address briefly the due process argument, which is... seems a bit of a variation on the collateral estoppel theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.830" offset="10887448">I got briefly into it in addressing Justice Stevens' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.124" offset="10912630">The basic question there is what is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.336" offset="10925482">And the... and the notion of fairness is circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.949" offset="10940006">It is unfair to rely on a judgement of acquittal only if one believes that a judgement of acquittal is a... a judgement that has more effect than any other judgement in any other type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.349" offset="11001551">A judgement of acquittal finally resolves the charges on... on which the defendant has been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.695" offset="11030912">It precludes a second trial on any offenses that are considered the same under the court's double jeopardy precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.122" offset="11068633">But it is not... emphatically not... an order expunging evidence, declaring that what witnesses saw did not occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.189" offset="11108966">No, but Mr. Nightingale, isn't it a little more significant than... with the double jeopardy clause and all the rest... than a normal collateral estoppel situation, because the defendant does have certain benefits out of an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.067" offset="11156405">He can get an immediate appeal if he later claims to be put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.248" offset="11169152">Because there is an interest in protecting the defendant from having to go through all of the difficulty of defending himself again against the same charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.514" offset="11198201">And that is somewhat implicated here if you assume that the other evidence really opened up a whole new... new inquiry; did he really go into this lady's house or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.111" offset="11236653">And, yes... he might have to put on all the same defendants he did at the prior trial, and all the rest of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.245" offset="11253162">So isn't there... isn't there an additional burden in the criminal context that you don't always find in the normal civil collateral estoppel situation?</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.553" offset="11286390">The... the burden of relitigating, I submit, if collateral estoppel permits relitigation in a civil or criminal proceeding, the burden is essentially the same, in terms of trial time and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.860" offset="11347621">The fact that the defendant is at risk of conviction for a different offense means that he may have a greater interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.497" offset="11378132">But in Eighty-Nine Firearms, for example, the defendant in that case was effectively required to relitigate the entire state of affairs that led to his acquittal, and then the forfeiture of the firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.824" offset="11423481">The fact that the... and in terms of assessing the importance of the fact that the defendant is... is subject to possible conviction, it's important to remember that he is subject to possible conviction for a different offense than that for which he was first tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.931" offset="11971947">The evidence was admissable if that judge could find that the jury would be reasonable in concluding by a preponderance of the evidence that that was... that Mr. Dowling was the one who was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.930" offset="12023879">And in that context, Mrs. Henry's testimony was its own foundation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2980.849" offset="12067556">I would add briefly that there is... there are means available to protect defendants against overzealous use of prior offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.828" offset="12131503">They are the same ones this court referred to in the Huddleston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.841" offset="12143520">As the trial court did in this case, the jury can be instructed that the evidence is to be considered only for a limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.346" offset="12181554">In this case the judge, during his final instructions, instructed the jury to the effect that you may consider this for the purpose of... if it assists you in determining who the bank robber was.</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.867" offset="12235680">The judge can limit the testimony to that element of the testimony that's relevant to the offense for which the defendant is then being charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.874" offset="12287716">Again, that is something the trial judge did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.888" offset="12303703">He admonished the prosecutor to avoid open-ended questions and limited the testimony quite carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.873" offset="12331706">The judge can exclude the evidence altogether if under rule 403 the balance of prejudice and probative value is against its admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.252" offset="12377159">Under all of these circumstances, we believe that there are ample means available of protecting defendants against unfair prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.981" offset="12432121">And that the... the principal rule of criminal trials should be the one that governs the case, which is that all relevant evidence is presumptively admissable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.467" offset="12470050">The admission of the evidence in this case did not constitute a second round of jeopardy for a single offense; it did not violate traditional principles of collateral estoppel; it's entirely consistent, we believe, with the court's decisions in Huddleston and Eighty-Nine Firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.457" offset="12537969">Accordingly, we ask the court to affirm the judgement of the court of appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Tucker</label>
            <text syncTime="3159.964" offset="12784042">--We would... the courts that have applied Ashe v. Swenson to this situation have basically said that there's really no principle of distinction between Ashe v. Swenson and the situation presented by the admissability of acquitted conduct evidence in a subsequent trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.815" offset="12847467">And if the court... we'd ask the court to look at the purposes that this court has said are the values that are protected by double jeopardy protection, and those same concerns are very much present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.532" offset="12894279">The defendant here is still subject to the same strain he would be of a retrial, the expense, the ordeal of a retrial; in fact, his situation is even worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.578" offset="12930537">He has been acquitted of crime A; he's now being tried of crime B; the government's machinery is lined up against him to convict him of crime B, and in the middle of crime B, he has to defend against crime A, when in fact he's already done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.708" offset="12982991">Clearly, those are the type of values that double jeopardy protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.272" offset="13001276">Last term the court, in rejecting the Missouri defendant's claim in, I think, Jones v. Thomas, about he should be... be entitled merely to have his 15-year sentence because the two consecutive sentences of 15 and life weren't valid, rejected that claim and pointed out that one of the reasons we reject that is that the defendant there had really... he didn't really have any legitimate expectation of finality that he would be entitled to that 15-year sentence if the two consecutive sentences were thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.419" offset="13113812">Here, we suggest that, indeed, a defendant who has been tried and acquitted and the government has had their opportunity to present their case, and he has successfully defended against that, does indeed have a legitimate expectation of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.461" offset="13170027">Now, also the concerns that the court... that double jeopardy protects against repetitive and harassing lawsuits are indeed applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.015" offset="13204196">For instance, suppose a defendant who has been acquitted and he... and he is suspected... or the government is thinking about charging him in what otherwise would be a very marginal second prosecution, as indeed was the case here, this was... this evidence was first introduced in the third trial, and the prosecutor even proffered to the court, we need this evidence... now, what this means is that a defendant is subject to repetitive lawsuits based on the fact that he had been acquitted because of... is that acquitted conduct evidence that may indeed be the piece of evidence that not only convicts him in the new trial, but, in fact, motivates the government to press forward with the new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.421" offset="13361871">Also, we have the concerns that are equally present here of double jeopardy prevents the government from utilizing the first trial as a dry run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.608" offset="13398651">Well, we have those same sorts of concerns here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.219" offset="13409100">The government probably learned something from its acquittal in the Vena Henry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.352" offset="13425609">They pare... obviously pared down their evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.195" offset="13436999">All of these concerns are equally present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.936" offset="13447866">Now, the government cites the Standefer case and the language in Standefer which the court says, well, perhaps we should take a cautious approach to extending collateral estoppel to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.185" offset="13492901">However, Standefer is entirely distinguishable based on these very same concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.209" offset="13512963">Because in Standefer, the defendant was claiming, don't prosecute me based on collateral estoppel on an aiding and abetting theory because defendant number two has been tried as the principal and acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.528" offset="13558312">Well, it follows that double jeopardy concerns are not quite as strong there because that defendant had indeed not suffered the expense, the ordeal of the first trial himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.225" offset="13605123">He had nothing to do with that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.596" offset="13610556">His arguments were not near as strong.</text>
