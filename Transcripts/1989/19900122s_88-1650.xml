            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87120">The opinion of the Court in No. 88-1650, Tafflin against Levitt will be announced by Justice Oâ€™Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="8.014" offset="119094">This case comes to the Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.589" offset="145425">The question presented is whether State Courts have concurrent jurisdiction over civil actions brought under the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act commonly referred to as RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.649" offset="209687">In an opinion filed today, we hold that State Courts do have concurrent jurisdiction to adjudicate such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.905" offset="242705">There is nothing in the language of the statute to suggest that Congress has by affirmative enactment divested the State Courts of such jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.135" offset="283561">The legislative history likewise does not unmistakably imply that Congress so intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.322" offset="308325">We find no clear incompatibility between concurrent jurisdictions and the federal interest underlying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.542" offset="345210">There is no significant danger of inconsistent application of federal criminal law because Federal Courts retain authority over the interpretation and application of such laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.304" offset="396305">We have full faith in the ability of State Courts to handle the complexities of civil RICO actions, particularly, since many RICO cases involve asserted violations of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.469" offset="448968">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.081" offset="459417">The decision of the court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.701" offset="469866">Justice White has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Scalia has also filed a concurring opinion which Justice Kennedy has joined.</text>
