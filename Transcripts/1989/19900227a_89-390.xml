            <text syncTime="11.672" offset="197305">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.608" offset="209113">This case concerns PBGC's efforts to protect the integrity of the government insurance program that insures the pensions of more than 30 million American workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.715" offset="249550">At issue is the scope of the agency's statutory authority to restore a terminated pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.852" offset="278076">I will discuss how the language of the statute, its legislative history, and PBGC's policy considerations each support its use of that statutory authority in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.445" offset="328440">We begin, of course, with the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.231" offset="343591">In Section 4047 Congress authorized PBGC to restore a terminated pension plan and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="56.087" offset="375043">"In any case in which the corporation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="58.520" offset="384760">that is, the PBGC,</text>
            <text syncTime="60.639" offset="393224">"determines such action to be appropriate and consistent with its duties under Title IV of ERISA. "</text>
            <text syncTime="66.775" offset="417779">Now, Congress could have said that PBGC could restore a terminated pension plan only if an employer's financial condition had improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.731" offset="453619">Or it could have said that PBGC could restore a plan where it could persuade a court that doing so was in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.487" offset="484548">But it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.820" offset="489981">What Congress said was... was that PBGC should make this determination, and it limited our discretion only by requiring that we exercise it appropriately and consistently with our statutory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.247" offset="543689">The court of appeals slid right by the statutory language though and went immediately to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.817" offset="569916">And then, rather than examining the legislative history to see whether there was a clearly expressed legislative intent contrary to PBGC's action in this case, the court of appeals turned the analysis on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.891" offset="622265">The court of appeals searched the legislative materials for an explicit reference to the use of restoration that PBGC made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.164" offset="655284">Not surprisingly, it found none because the legislative history confirms what the plain language of the statute says, that Congress intended PBGC to determine when its restoration authority was to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.639" offset="705230">This legislative history is sparse, but it's straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="719441">It says that Congress intended PBGC to restore a plan if a plan or employer had a favorable reversal of business trends or if, and again I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="153.231" offset="763536">"some other factor made termination no longer advisable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="157.035" offset="778791">The court of appeals simply disregarded this final phrase and focused instead on the one example given... a favorable reversal of business trends.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.474" offset="812541">The court then concluded that was the only circumstance under which the agency could restore a terminated pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.128" offset="839186">That approach was contrary to this Court's teachings in Chevron and its progeny.</text>

            <text syncTime="2238.046" offset="9102866">But if there's any doubt about that, let's look at the conflicting mandates of other important Federal statutes, and let's start with the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.866" offset="9134109">Section 8(d) of the labor law, as you know, says that an employer must bargain over wages, hours, terms and conditions of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2277.505" offset="9260646">But we don't permit a government agency, either this one or the IRS or anyone else, to go about regulating the rules that apply to the substantive outcomes of bargaining contrary to the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.134" offset="9759167">There's no question that with the passage of time the unfunded liability in these plans is now over $3 billion, and if they were returned to us today, the question is do we have to make those contributions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.025" offset="9806710">If we do, our creditors would be forced under the Bankruptcy Code to evaluate whether liquidation was better than paying that bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.648" offset="9841191">In liquidation, the plans would automatically be reterminated under Section 4041 of ERISA, under the voluntary termination standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.669" offset="9877345">By contrast, if we didn't have to pay those contributions because they were pre-petition obligations, as the Second Circuit noted, then the largest of these plans would have to be reterminated immediately because it has no assets today, and that is clear if one calculates out from the... from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.250" offset="9951637">So, in either event, it depends on whether it's a pre-petition obligation, but we view it as a futile act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.071" offset="13782964">That does mean that there will be a... an amount payable back to the agency once restoration is upheld.</text>
