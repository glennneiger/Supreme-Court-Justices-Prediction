            <text syncTime="11.040" offset="190061">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.473" offset="199778">The issues in the present case are three.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.516" offset="212004">First, can an unconstitutionally, overbroad statute be construed on appeal and then retroactively applied to affirm the Appellant's conviction?</text>
            <text syncTime="26.911" offset="253590">Second, may this state, consistent with First Amendment rights, prohibit the private, in-home possession of depictions of child nudity, where the nudity consists of either a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on the genitals?</text>
            <text syncTime="43.832" offset="321195">And third, has the Ohio Supreme Court successfully limited Ohio's child nudity statute to bring it within constitutional limitations?</text>
            <text syncTime="52.928" offset="357662">Clyde Osborne was charged under an Ohio statute prohibiting the possession of pictures of nude children.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.574" offset="388173">This statute was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face and as applied to Mr. Osborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.446" offset="415654">The statute prohibited simple possession and mere viewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.761" offset="432999">It failed to include an element of scienter, as required by this Court's decisions in Smith v. California and New York v. Ferber.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.156" offset="466541">It failed to specify the age below which children could not be depicted, also as required by New York v. Ferber, and it prohibited depictions of mere nudity, contrary to this Court's decisions in Erznoznik v. Jacksonville and Ferber.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.757" offset="528921">Mr. Osborne challenged the constitutionality of the statute prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.351" offset="551282">The court denied his motion, and the trial proceeded under the statute as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.903" offset="573538">Only at the close of evidence did the trial court rule that the statute applied to depictions of those under the age of 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.161" offset="606557">Mr. Osborne was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.183" offset="618678">On appeal, the Tenth District Court of Appeals affirmed 18 as the age of minority, and construed nudity to mean a lewd exhibition of the genitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.330" offset="659220">The Ohio Supreme Court redefined nudity on review to drop the requirement that genitalia by depicted; nudity now means, under that court's interpretation, either a lewd exhibition or, in the alternative, a depiction involving a graphic focus on the genitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.945" offset="729646">The court added an element of scienter, recklessness, and again affirmed that 18 is the upper limit of the age of minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.442" offset="763710">Mr. Osborne's conviction was affirmed under this new construction and he moved for rehearing on the ground that this retroactive conviction violated his right to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.809" offset="809163">His motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.620" offset="816373">Clyde Osborne stands today convicted under a statute wholly different from the one under which he was charged and tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.195" offset="850645">And this is the basis of our first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.809" offset="861199">The statute in this case, as I previously noted, was unconstitutional on its face and due to its unconstitutionality was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.213" offset="898815">A conviction obtained under such a statute is a nullity, and the conviction cannot be brought to life by a subsequent constitutionalizing construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.850" offset="941342">This principle is well established in precedent from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.923" offset="957643">In Lovell v. Griffin, Thornhill v. Alabama, and Shuttlesworth v. BIrmingham, this Court has held that an unconstitutional statute is in fact invalid on its face, that no one is required to comply with such a statute, and that a subsequent construction will not succeed in criminalizing preconstruction conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.207" offset="1042697">This is, in fact, the essence of the overbreadth doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.065" offset="4730142">And it goes much further, it allows all kinds of sexual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.456" offset="4747697">And in addition, if the state truly is interested in stopping that kind of activity, it would not have created the exceptions that exist in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.333" offset="4783223">Parents are now permitted to possess depictions of children that are lewd exhibitions or involve a graphic focus on the genitals under the state supreme court's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.978" offset="4881862">And the State of... and the statute, as construed, allows people to keep pictures like this for artistic purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.906" offset="4913522">If, in fact, these pictures are of sexual abuse of children, there is no interest that legitimizes letting those exceptions exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.551" offset="4956154">As this Court said in Florida Star v. B.J.F., when the state creates a statute that is underinclusive and leaves a broad area of the activity it supposedly has an interest in stopping, unprohibited, the state has demonstrated its lack of a compelling interest in dealing with that subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.177" offset="5050613">And for that reason, I think the State of Ohio has failed to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest either in prohibiting the private, in-home possession of these materials or in prohibiting, in the broader question of the overbreadth of the statute, in bringing it into a narrowly-tailored stance that serves a compelling state interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1267.994" offset="5217901">--That's true, but I believe that when you go to the point of prohibiting the private, in-home possession, as noted in Stanley v. Georgia, and there, are again attacking or invading the fundamental rights to privacy to receive information and to think thoughts, you have again moved into the area of fundamental rights and a compelling interest is in fact required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.781" offset="5309016">Now, again, and the third issue in our case is that we do not believe that these pictures fall within a category of unprotected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.916" offset="5349558">In New York v. Ferber, this Court said that in order to constitute child pornography, the depictions must include characterization... pictures of sexual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.334" offset="5391249">That's not required in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.888" offset="5401489">And depictions of sexual conduct or sexual activity of any kind are regulated by two other statutes, the two that immediately precede this one, Ohio Revised Code 2907.321 and 322.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.024" offset="5454048">In fact, these still regulate depictions of mere nudity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.539" offset="5472020">Now, this Court in Ferber did say that graphic or... lewd exhibitions of the genitals, so long as that phrase was not construed too broadly, would qualify as sexual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.957" offset="5525728">But in this case, the Ohio Supreme Court has limited the requirement that genitalia be depicted, and this construction is the only statute in the many that deal with this type of material that doesn't at least require that genitalia be depicted, and for that reason, brought it into the definition of nudity, which is included in 2907.01(H).</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.033" offset="5622067">That includes depictions of breasts, buttocks, the pubic area, as well as genitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.476" offset="5643801">So even under the state supreme court's statute and even under the broadest characterization of the kind of materials this court felt could be characterized as unprotected in New York v. Ferber, this statute falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.766" offset="5696986">And as I previously pointed, out, this statute does not address depictions that are commercial in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.941" offset="5725721">It also includes mere possession and viewing... simple viewing of these photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.124" offset="5750381">And Ferber dealt with the production and distribution of this type of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.749" offset="5776921">For that reason, we do not believe that it falls within the Ferber definition, and as I previously pointed out, I do not think that it fits the state... that the state has demonstrated a compelling state interest in prohibiting the possession of these materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.754" offset="5864902">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.607" offset="5884337">Ohio has adopted a comprehensive statutory scheme dealing with child pornography, which deals with production, distribution and possession, and it goes on a continuum from material that is involving a minor, whether the material is obscene under Miller, to material that depicts sexual conduct, typically vaginal intercourse, anal or oral intercourse, and then finally, what's involved in this case, material that depicts child-oriented nudity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.221" offset="6022786">The Ohio Supreme Court, and prior to that, the Tenth District Court of Appeals... we have ten Ohio appellate judges looking at this statute, and all of them concluding and giving a proper narrowing construction... the statute... when you consider the entire scheme in pari materia, when you consider the exceptions and exemptions is... is directed at the lewd exhibition or the graphic focus on the genitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.470" offset="6135844">Ferber itself in the New York statute in question in Ferber permits, as a description of unprotected speech as child pornography, lewd exhibition of the genitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.541" offset="6192059">It's the State's position that the statute, both on its face and as applied, was... was constitutional with respect to the defendant Osborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.528" offset="6236049">The statute itself, when you... when you read it, and the Ohio courts made this clear, is directed at the kind of material the court was concerned with in Ferber and found that to be unprotected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.499" offset="6299893">Ohio, along with 18 other states, has also concluded that you need to address this problem not just with respect to production, not just with respect to distribution, but it's also necessary to get to the point of prohibiting possession of material that fits... fits the definition, and that possession follows a continuum in those three state statutes, not only with respect to the lewd exhibition of the genitals, but also with respect to the obscene and/or the actual sexual conduct depicted in the... in the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.954" offset="6453702">The state thinks that the defendant in this Court is extending what this Court has repeatedly said should be viewed narrowly, and that is the... the Stanley decision from 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.123" offset="6510439">Stanley obviously predated Ferber, and the Court, I think, when the Court factors in the Ferber decision with Stanley, and looking at Stanley itself, it said, where... where compelling reasons exist, the state can enter into the home and prohibit certain possessory offenses involving printed, filmed or recorded material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.078" offset="6598211">That this case is an exception to Stanley in that regard, that this... this case is a case that does present compelling reasons, as the Court recognized in the... in the subsequent Ferber decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.879" offset="6661427">The child pornography in question, and I think the record in this case amply reflects we're not talking about mere nudity here, we're talking about almost gymnastic poses with a young man, which the defendant admitted, and I think in response to one of Justice Blackmun's questions, we should point out the evidence of the defendant's knowledge of this young man... young man's age, apart from just looking at the photographs themself, was the defendant's admission that when they were given to him, he was told the boy was 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.530" offset="6780023">On the back of State's Exhibit 1D there is a notation that says Tommy-13&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.305" offset="6807086">So the evidence was clear with respect, apart from looking at the photograph, that the evidence was clear that it is a young man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.252" offset="6838955">It is the kind of material the Court, and I think the 18 states in addition to Ohio that have prohibited possession, is concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.698" offset="6880751">The gymnastic-type poses involved in this case concentrate graphically on the stretched anal area of the boy, the boy having a... all parts of his body exposed, his genitalia turgid... how the defendant himself described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.844" offset="6973329">In one of the photographs there is a dildo which... which the defendant admitted he recognized as a dildo, which is placed to the man's anus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.509" offset="6999974">So I think when the defendant... appellant in this court describes the statute as dealing with mere nudity, I think we have to look at it in the context of the material that he was prosecuted for possessing, and that material I think clearly is within the confines of Ferber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.833" offset="7069251">And when we look at the state interest that justifies going into the home, prohibiting that possession, and I think I agree with Justice Scalia when he made reference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.002" offset="7121914">We're not talking about pure speech, we're not talking about core First Amendment expressive type of conduct, we're talking about a possessory offense dealing with certain kind of material that has the visual depictions of the minor engaged in this kind of specified sexual conduct, or the lewd exhibition of the genitals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.806" offset="7637153">Otherwise, there is no reason for the legislature to have inserted in the statute the exceptions and exemptions for artistic, medical, proper... other proper purposes that are in the statute itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2665.533" offset="10808000">And we argue that both the statute, which is 15 years old, and those existing Ohio Supreme Court decisions did give an indication that that was, you know, an element of scienter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.102" offset="10990335">It's our position that the Court found in... in Ferber that there are a number of interests the state has in controlling and regulating child pornography, mainly because of the harm caused to children through its production, distribution and use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.305" offset="11067135">That harm being physical, psychological, emotional mental, physiological, and that that interest in proscribing possession of the material is the same as it is in a production and distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.915" offset="11125545">The permanent record of harm which the Court was concerned with in Ferber is ongoing and continues, while the possession occurs in the privacy of the home.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.958" offset="11253754">The only method... or an additional method that the state needs in that underground child pornography market is that possession offense if we're going to dry up the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.465" offset="11299729">That is an interest I believe the state has, in addition to the interest of avoiding that continuing haunting fear on the child who's been used in this kind... in producing this kind of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.134" offset="11350407">The Court was concerned with... and noted in Ferber itself that that permanent record was evidence of ongoing harm due to the psychological and emotional distress to the youngster.</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.367" offset="13319413">He noted that when the state finds that it is able to, it will use its other two statutes on production and distribution to go after people who have this type of depiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.376" offset="13367373">Those two statutes already prohibit possession of those kinds of depictions that constitute obscenity in Ohio and that depict sexual activity as it's defined under the Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.587" offset="13428291">Mr. O'Brien's acknowledgement that those statute will be used... used to go after these people is a clear indication that the construction of this statute has moved it from what it originally was intended to be by the Ohio legislature, which was a prohibition against depictions of mere nudity, and changed it into a child pornography statute, which is what those other two statutes, Ohio Revised Code 2907.321 and 322 are.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.069" offset="13914168">So, I think that although the court does waffle on the point, I think it's very clear from its own opinion that it acknowledges that that wasn't the case and that it's construction that day is what brings the statute into what it hopes to be constitutional lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.029" offset="13974041">Another point that was raised by Mr. O'Brien is the fact that he alleges that 18 other states have statutes that are very much like ours.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.189" offset="14018658">None of the 18 state statutes cited by Mr. O'Brien or in the amicus brief from the Ohio Attorney General include viewing as a potential for conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.709" offset="14520732">When the language of the statute literally includes within its meaning, conduct that is clearly, constitutionally protected, it, in effect, gives no notice that any conduct is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.560" offset="14572141">And for that reason, there is no notice when you have a statute that's overbroad on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.283" offset="14595024">And this was noted by this Court in the Shuttlesworth decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.577" offset="14612265">It was also noted in another case we've cited in our brief, Ashton v. Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.440" offset="14631700">In both of those cases the Court found that the statutes were invalid on their face and noted that the language used in the statutes fell within parameters that this court had held in other cases was... were unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3636.269" offset="14690946">Does it make a difference that Shuttlesworth was a prior restraint case?</text>

            <text syncTime="3639.203" offset="14702753">I don't believe it does, because the same principles were followed, as I just noted, in Ashton, which was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.917" offset="14729607">That was simply a criminal libel statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.087" offset="14738279">And the same principles were followed in Thornhill v. Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.020" offset="14753953">That was a loitering statute which was... prohibited picketing in the site of a labor dispute... anywhere near the site of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.826" offset="14789270">So this type of decision has not been limited to situations where there was a licensing or permit requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.029" offset="14814035">In addition to the fact that you can't make up for the fact that there was no notice, another aspect that I think negates against a retrial in this case is the fact that Mr. Osborne was denied the opportunity to have a fair trial or... and... and goes against... I notice my time is up.</text>
