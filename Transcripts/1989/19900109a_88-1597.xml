          <heading>Argument of Allen E. Daubman</heading>
          <turn speaker="allen_e_daubman" startTime="0.000" stopTime="134.537">
            <label>Mr. Allen E. Daubman</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149025">This case presents issues central to the operation of co-curricular activities in the public secondary schools in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.170" offset="177655">Of critical importance in that regard, obviously, is the equal access act, which was enacted by Congress in the fall of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.110" offset="213391">The act basically provides that a school which conducts, or has a limited open forum, may not deny access to that forum on the basis of the political, philosophical or religious content of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.720" offset="279846">In that regard, the Congress defined "limited open forum" to mean when a school district grants an opportunity for one or more noncurriculum-related student groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional time.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.014" offset="349018">It is that statutory framework which causes difficulty in school districts in trying to comply with the act and meet their educational obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="398233">The Equal Access Act, as we see it, basically balances three concerns: certainly the free speech rights of students in our public schools; certainly also it balances a concern of nonestablishment of religion; and certainly also it affords deference to school officials, affords them the autonomy and discretion to make educational decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="515053">In that context, we urge the Court to interpret the act, interpret noncurriculum-related, as that term is used in the act, to encompass a situation which is not found at Westside High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.083" offset="573254">All of the student clubs and organizations at Westside High School were under, by school board policy, the direct control and supervision of the administration and shall have a faculty sponsor.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.260" offset="622050">The record is replete with testimony that the school officials maintained an active role in practice, in determining the goals and objectives of student clubs and organizations and the manner in which those clubs and organizations operated in their school.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.135" offset="6165547">The students of Westside High School who desire to form a student-initiated, student-led and voluntary Bible club do acknowledge that the school officials have important and oftentime delicate functions to perform with regard to the operation of schools under their control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.145" offset="6225525">However, these concerns do not justify the prohibition of these students' Bible club from the Westside High School campus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.191" offset="11985734">Although I would think that under this Court's decisions under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, there might very well be power to reach that school [inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.297" offset="12022201">But Congress saw fit not to exercise the entirety of its power in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.051" offset="12049159">The discussion has been not about Congress' purposes and intentions and motives at all, but rather with respect to the meaning of curriculum related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.592" offset="12095343">There are three reasons why we would urge to the Court not to embrace the school district's open-ended approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.114" offset="12125436">We believe, first, that its approach is quite inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the word curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.803" offset="12160232">The word curriculum means the aggregate of courses... courses offered by the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.407" offset="12190638">It was that common meaning, secondly, that one most readily discerns in reading the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.563" offset="12223239">In particular, the description by Senator Hatfield, one of the co-sponsors of the Senate, who described curriculum-related clubs as those that are, in effect, extensions of the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.489" offset="12278932">And by the express admission at trial of the principal of Westside High School, Dr. Findley, Peer Advocates... it was discussed at trial; it was the subject of testimony at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.047" offset="12325116">At page 277 of the trial transcript, Dr. Findley stated that Peer Advocates was not related to any course at Westside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.486" offset="12366912">That, in our view, is sufficient to trigger the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.765" offset="13180052">In fact, Senator Gorton conducted extremely skillful cross examination of Senator Hatfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.002" offset="13205025">It will be recalled that Senator Gorton thought that the act would be much clearer if you eliminated political and philosophical and made it quite clear that all you were trying to protect were religious groups by virtue of the discrimination that was being visited upon religious students.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.240" offset="13533959">Again, the act isn't triggered unless we have noncurriculum related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.309" offset="13554230">What the school has chosen to do is in structuring their co-curricular activities is those groups that advocate a particular point of view are not included in the curricular or co-curricular activities of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.753" offset="13619954">And that was not the case with the club that was requested in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.473" offset="13634896">Another example of the unworkability of the test advocated by the other side, Photography Club, which was identified as a suspect club in this case was alternatively taught.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.900" offset="13692574">Photography was, as a club or as a class, depending upon the availability of a state-certified teacher who could teach photography.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.970" offset="13724862">To suggest that we cannot have... that we create a limited open forum by having a photography club when a state-certified teacher is unavailable to teach it as a regular class I think presents an unworkable problem, a dilemma that school districts would not be able to work with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.432" offset="13794661">Service clubs also indicated by the legislative history to perhaps in some circumstances be noncurriculum related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.138" offset="13829561">In our school district the record is clear that service clubs in many of those... in the sociology class activities with service clubs could constitute... in some cases required over the years, in other cases could be used as extra credit in some of the sociology classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.165" offset="13901658">Again, to say that a particular type of club is noncurriculum related for all purposes I think really stifles the efforts of educators to deal with curriculum issues as they're constantly being called upon to do, in structuring a program that is relevant and provides educational benefit to its students.</text>
