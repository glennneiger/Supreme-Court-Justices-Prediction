          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="19.045" stopTime="402.128">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="19.045" offset="217390">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.580" offset="231496">These two cases bring before the Court a single question: whether the First Amendment prohibits the United States from prosecuting individuals for knowingly burning a flag of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.125" offset="301713">Two district courts, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, held that the Flag Protection Act of 1989, passed by Congress in response to this Court's decision in Texas against Johnson, was unconstitutional as applied to the conduct of the individuals here.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.894" offset="416757">In both cases it is undisputed that each of the appellees knowingly burned a flag of the United States and thus violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.535" offset="471300">In our view, there are four reasons that argue powerfully in support of the constitutionality of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.593" offset="507558">First, Congress acted carefully and with great respect for this Court's decisions concerning flag protection statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.116" offset="553638">It took seriously the Court's expressed statement in Texas against Johnson that the inquiry there was bounded not only by the facts of the case, but by the state's statute there in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.641" offset="611735">In relying on this Court's various writings and decisions Congress amended the Federal statute in response to Texas against Johnson to eliminate the prior, clearly content-laden language of Section 700, the language, "cast contempt upon" and "publicly".</text>
            <text syncTime="143.709" offset="716015">Second, Congress acted very narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.096" offset="737540">It focused, as this Court said in Smith v. Goguen, that it could lawfully do, on certain specific areas of conduct where legislative latitude is greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.372" offset="798667">And Congress carved out a narrowly crafted set of protections as to certain conduct, while permitting robust and uninhibited speech to continue unabated.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.318" offset="862406">There was no prohibition on Congress' part against the publication or the dissemination of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.506" offset="899186">Third and relatedly, as I will seek to show in the context of the facts of these two cases, flag burning leaves a major message gap, a gap that needs to be filled in with words, either written or spoken, as happened in both the District of Columbia and Seattle demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.591" offset="1011513">It is, in our judgment, the equivalent of shouting or screaming or using a loudspeaker at full blast to arrest the audience's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.000" offset="1069191">This is not in our judgment an especially weighty value on the First Amendment scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.439" offset="1102941">Fourth, on the other side of those scales are interests of the highest order in the national community.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.580" offset="1147454">Those interests are intangible, to be sure, just as the concept of human dignity is intangible.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.269" offset="1182249">But those interests are no less real, rooted as they are in the Nation's history and experience, and especially our history as a community of people in this century in which so many of our co-members of the national community have been asked to sacrifice so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.135" offset="1277753">To focus now on the facts and the nature of flag burning.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.039" offset="1301367">In evaluating the expressive content, the content of this conduct, it is useful to examine precisely what happened here and what it is that flag burning conveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.881" offset="1368659">This can be seen by way of example in the statement of Shawn Eichman, one of the District of Columbia appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.689" offset="1407947">Ms. Eichman's concerns that animated her conduct were quite varied in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.176" offset="1437831">They ranged from civil rights concerns to concerns about the environment, and concerns about certain aspects of U.S. foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.334" offset="1478477">The same is true with respect to the Seattle demonstration, a videotape of which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.007" offset="1513168">The concerns that were animating the Seattle appellees ranged from a then ongoing labor strike at Boeing Aircraft facilities in the area to the treatment afforded Hispanic Americans and national policies concerning the homeless.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.818" offset="1588401">Now a passerby happening on these acts of flag burning would, in our judgment, likely and reasonably conclude that the actor is in a state of profound disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.347" offset="1658513">But it does not tell us with what.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.965" offset="1673037">That message, the what, comes, if at all, from the speech that is incident or tied to the conduct as occurred in Street against New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.356" offset="1718595">And that speech, of course, is fully protected, no matter how offensive that speech may be to the majority.</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Kunstler</label>
            <text syncTime="1631.950" offset="6669008">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.984" offset="6681129">We pose the question somewhat differently than was posed by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.286" offset="6698265">We think the question before the Court is can the government criminally prohibit flag burning, a form of political expression deeply critical of the government and anathema to its officials?</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.594" offset="6743509">And I will address three points, and during them respond to some of the points raised by General Starr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.700" offset="6776006">We hold, one, that Texas v. Johnson controls these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.437" offset="6798889">Number two, that the Flag Protection Act can simply not be upheld as an attempt to protect the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.693" offset="6839953">And three, that there is no basis whatsoever to accept the government's invitation to overturn Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.715" offset="6872032">On the first point, that Texas v. Johnson controls, all parties have conceded that the defendants' conduct below was expressive enough to raise First Amendment concerns, and I do not think there is any argument on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.808" offset="6932427">Number two, all parties conceded as well that the congressional intent behind this statute was to protect the flag as a national symbol, and by definition the governmental interest was only harmed by conduct expressing some message of disrespect or dissent, as indicated by Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.340" offset="7026572">In other words, the interest was related to the suppression of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.411" offset="7046843">Ergo, the strict scrutiny rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.363" offset="7062621">Then lastly, that the government interest in preserving this symbolic value is not a compelling interest to justify a criminal penal statute and jail flag-burners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.456" offset="7114970">That is what Johnson held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.741" offset="7128136">Now, the Court... I must say to the Court, in rereading what I said last time in the Texas v. Johnson case, I want a little mea culpa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.863" offset="7168574">In responding to Justice Stevens, I believe, I said that the government had no legitimate interest in enacting any legislation about the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.036" offset="7201279">I think I was wrong in that respect, and this Court, of course, did not adopt that argument, and I think rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.440" offset="7226879">I am persuaded that there are things the government can do with reference to the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.927" offset="7248822">They can do many things to persuade people to respect it, to fly it, to indicate how it should be flown, to indicate the dimensions, to indicate the type of flag it should be and how it should appear, and they do that in part under Title 36 U.S.C. 173 to 177, but they cannot do it in a penal way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.709" offset="7347983">So I express my mea culpa here in response to that question a year ago that Justice Stevens asked of me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.065" offset="7377449">They can... they have a legitimate right to regulate the flag, but not under a penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.587" offset="7411513">Now, the government is now arguing, apparently, that there's now a compelling interest that they have in the flag because they passed a new act, because a new act was enacted and became effective on October 28th of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.834" offset="7492492">If the Court were to accept that argument that the mere adoption of a new act would mean that you would reverse yourself in Texas v. Johnson, then I think it would require reversing Marbury against Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.677" offset="7551842">But that's not a sufficient reason, merely because Congress says that it is now enacting a new act in an attempt, direct attempt, to get around Texas v. Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.866" offset="7596668">And I call the Court's attention that when Johnson was decided there was a prior Federal statute on the books itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.822" offset="7624463">They already had enacted an act, and this Court was quite conscious of the prior Section 700 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.911" offset="7660825">And lastly, maybe stranger than all, even the congressional amici didn't argue for this position at all, only for the application of a more lenient O'Brien standard or time, place and manner standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.254" offset="7726131">And they cannot change what is obviously the Court's duty in this case merely by passing legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.829" offset="7764479">Secondly, with reference to the question of the physical integrity in all circumstances that are now claimed by General Starr, this was a claim raised by the congressional amici that it was a content-neutral statute that was enacted here and only to protect the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.658" offset="7855803">Well, it's obviously that is not true on the face of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.712" offset="7871999">First of all, it is not content neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.414" offset="7882866">It is content and viewpoint base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.616" offset="7895614">It singles out a political symbol, one political symbol, and in our brief we indicated what if that political symbol had been instead of the flag the Democratic Party flag or another official flag of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.876" offset="7956636">And as Justice Fortas so well put it in Tinker, he said it is also relevant that the school authorities did not purport to prohibit the wearing of all symbols of political or controversial significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.802" offset="8012329">The record shows the students in some of the schools wore buttons relating to national political campaign, and some even wore an Iron Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.841" offset="8048482">The order prohibiting the wearing of armbands did not extend to these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.527" offset="8063320">Instead, a particular symbol, black armbands worn to exhibit opposition to this Nation's involvement in Vietnam were singled out for prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.899" offset="8100727">Clearly, the prohibition of expression of one particular opinion is not constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.989" offset="8129148">So it is a content-based statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.489" offset="8139075">It singles out one particular political symbol, just as in Stromberg the red flag was singled out as one particular political symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.212" offset="8182020">And it is viewpoint-based because it proscribes conduct which was associated with dissent, irrespective of the effect on the physical integrity of the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.906" offset="8240744">It permits, as the Court knows, conduct which shows respect, and that is the ceremonial burning of the flag, which was put in there in order not to penalize patriotic groups who burn the flag... old and soiled flags, and burnt them in a ceremonial fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.219" offset="8318066">And then the language of the statute itself is just to pick up all disrespect examples, all dissenting examples maintained on the floor or ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.908" offset="8360802">Senator Dole wanted that in there because that was days after Fred Scott Tyler, one of the Appellees before this Court, had placed a flag on the ground in that rather well-known Chicago Art Institute exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.251" offset="8422138">Physically defiles, that was Senator Wilson's contribution to the statute for... and he said that's for acts that do not do permanent harm to the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.308" offset="8466441">Senator Biden said in response to that, well, we have "defaces" in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.962" offset="8485041">We don't need "defiles", but both "defiles" and "defaces" went into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.949" offset="8508969">And both Senators Biden and Wilson referred to conduct that does not do permanent damage but injures the flag as a symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.072" offset="8545436">And the word "defile" has a dictionary meaning of dishonor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.024" offset="8565289">And yet it permits conduct which is in essence which is dangerous to the flag such as, I've already mentioned, the burning of worn or soiled flags, but it permits other type of conduct that would be, for example, flying in a hurricane, flying in a thunderstorm, flying in a tornado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.671" offset="8643865">And, therefore, it is totally viewpoint based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.341" offset="8666539">And as I think Mr. Fried points out in the brief for the ACLU, he says far from protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, these terms protect the flag only from those who would hurt it or cast it in a bad light.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.303" offset="8742399">And any statute, I submit to this Court, even one designed to protect physical integrity, in all circumstances would be content based because Congress' interest is... ultimately indistinguishable from the flag's symbolic value.</text>

New York Times against Sullivan and reread Justice Brennan's words about the Alien and Sedition Acts, it was just 193 years ago, virtually to the day... May 16 of 1793... that the President of the United States in a special message to Congress asked for a statute which he said would repel insinuations so derogatory to the honor and aggression, so dangerous to the Constitution, union and even independence of the Nation, it's an indispensable duty of the Congress.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="3405.752" offset="13764179">Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, this is not a sedition act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.424" offset="13790824">This is not, as has been suggested in briefs by our colleagues on the other side, punishment for civil blasphemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.796" offset="13828335">Robust, uninhibited debate goes on, unimpeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.934" offset="13848920">Congress felt very strongly about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.386" offset="13862713">Congress had the deepest regard for this Court's teachings, as well as our system of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.790" offset="13892283">What it sought to do was to comply with Texas against Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.610" offset="13915584">It heard testimony from eminent scholars who reviewed the entirety of this Court's handiwork in the First Amendment area and in flag protection specifically, and it say a way, appropriately, respectfully, to, in a narrow way, prohibit conduct, not words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.957" offset="14000953">Secondly, it is not so that an act of flag burning means "I hate America".</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.296" offset="14030314">Carlos Garza is one of the Washington State appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.367" offset="14050585">In his sworn statement as to why he engaged in flag burning, he said</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.937" offset="14076917">"The American flag represents the system and the government for which it stands. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.607" offset="14099591">"I love and respect America. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.626" offset="14111712">"I love and respect the American people. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.911" offset="14124773">"I do not love and respect the way Hispanic-Americans are treated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.732" offset="14148074">In his sworn statement, Darius Strong, one of the Seattle appellees, said that his sole objection was with any statute that might in any way prevent someone from doing whatever that person sought to do by way of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.996" offset="14237099">This statute does not inhibit free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.049" offset="14253400">It prohibits a very narrow form of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.167" offset="14265834">I thank the Court.</text>
