            <text syncTime="71.698" offset="434878">In its judgment below, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit imposed two sweeping constraints on such extraterritorial searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.524" offset="470196">First, the court held that respondent was entitled to invoke the protections of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.591" offset="502483">And, second, the court held that under that amendment the agents were required to secure a search warrant from an American court before they could conduct the search of respondent's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.512" offset="550130">That broad, potentially far-reaching and in our view mistaken decision, arises from a not uncommon set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.337" offset="585448">On January 24th, federal marshals took respondent, a Mexican national, into custody in the United States believing that his two houses in Mexico would contain evidence of narcotics trafficking as well as his complicity in the assassination of a federal narcotics agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.448" offset="653889">DEA agents made arrangements to search his houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.871" offset="667577">After attempting first, without success, to reach the second Deputy Attorney General of the State of Mexico, the agents contacted the Director General of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police, thereafter spoke with more local police authorities, and from those persons secured permission to conduct the searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.223" offset="736958">Thereafter the agents, together with members of the Mexican police force, proceeded to respondent's Mexicali and San Felipe residences.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.174" offset="3440840">First of all, if you go back and take a look at what the contemporary versions of the... that were available for the Fourth Amendment to choose from... for example, Your Honor's dissenting opinion in New York Telephone suggested that the Fourth Amendment derives... that the closest precursor was the Massachusetts Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.254" offset="3517118">Well, the Massachusetts Bill of Rights was phrased "every subject".</text>
            <text syncTime="847.529" offset="3538225">When... when Richard Henry Lee, for example, tried to append a Bill of Rights to the Constitution before it was submitted to the ratifying conventions, he phrased it as "the citizens".</text>
            <text syncTime="861.490" offset="3594022">When Patrick Henry, in the ratification convention in Virginia came up with a version of the Fourth Amendment, he limited it to "every freeman".</text>
            <text syncTime="870.155" offset="3628713">So, there was a sense, I think, at the time of the framing of the Fourth Amendment, of confining the scope of its protections, a point I think--</text>

            <text syncTime="917.222" offset="3817004">The last point I want to make and then I'll move to the other two factors, Justice Kennedy, that I think inform the analysis is... it's worth comparing the other provisions in the Bill of Rights that also use the phrase "the people" because they cannot be understood unless you recognize that "the people" was a limiting concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.105" offset="3892550">The other provisions that use that phrase are the Ninth and Tenth Amendments which make utterly no sense except in terms of this compact that I'm describing; the Second Amendment, which refers to the right to bear arms, which can't plausibly be assumed to be a right of persons overseas to have arms; and finally, a portion of the First Amendment which speaks of the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.880" offset="3983665">Again, the notion that one comes back to is the sense of a compact relationship with the government that receives some of the power but in which the people reserve the balance that is not extended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.278" offset="4249174">And what's more, it seems to us that adjudication of what is a reasonable expectation of privacy in an American court in a contested criminal litigation or any other kind is perhaps unseemly, perhaps even improper, raising, I suppose, even act of state doctrine questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.330" offset="4317405">Now, that's just the first inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.010" offset="4324197">What is the nature of the right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.060" offset="4328377">But from this Court's cases, we think that there are two other factors that again move us away from this universalist view taken by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.408" offset="4361709">The second is what is the relationship between the United States and the place in which the constitutional claim arises?</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.871" offset="4387622">The fact that the search or seizure takes place in a foreign country, in a separate sovereignty, makes the case, I think, for overseas application of a constitutional right a very difficult one to win on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.022" offset="4444151">And that's true for any number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.004" offset="4456168">The fact that this is a separate sovereignty, Mexico, indicates that it's their laws and not ours that ought to presumptively control disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.149" offset="4484694">Our Constitution, by its nature, does not seem designed to have widespread overseas application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.862" offset="4507577">The preamble which Justice Stevens adverted to before uses language that just doesn't sound like it was written for Mexico, France, The Netherlands, and the rest of the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.617" offset="4794610">I guess our view is that that feature of the Fourth Amendment makes it seem inapplicable overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.001" offset="4828151">But we freely concede it also bears on how you would analyze it should you conclude that it does apply overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.027" offset="4856259">I mean, it seems to me these defects, the inapplicability and the inappropriateness of applying the doctrine, weigh in both at the threshold... does it apply +/?</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.574" offset="4894398">and at what Justice O'Connor referred to as our fallback position... how does it apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.080" offset="4916445">Finally, the last factor that we think is relevant is what is the relationship of the claimant to the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.114" offset="4948524">This is a familiar inquiry, one raised in Johnson against Eisentrager, more recently in Landon against Plasencia and the basic notion is that,</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.442" offset="4981856">"aliens are accorded a generous and ascending scale of rights as he increases his identity with our society. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.506" offset="5010173">This is a point that comes up in a great many of the immigration cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.091" offset="5028458">And the notion is, again, the closer the connection to the United States of citizenship or naturalization or permanent residence, the greater the claim for the protections of the social compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.041" offset="5076315">Now, viewing these three factors as a whole in this case I suggest that the solution is not difficult to find because respondent is at the wrong end of each of the three spectrums that I've suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.168" offset="5124798">The Fourth Amendment, first of all, is, we think, peculiarly out of place in an overseas context and peculiarly unwarranted for overseas application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.524" offset="5170251">Second, this is a completely separate sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.846" offset="5183521">Mexico is independent of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.280" offset="5197209">It's a wholly extraterritorial search unlike, say, searches on the high seas or in the Customs waters or in territories in which the United States exercises substantial sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.519" offset="5242140">And, finally, this is a claimant with little or no ongoing connection to the United States, little or no membership, if any, in the United States community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.967" offset="5275995">Those factors, we think, taken as a whole, confirm our view that the court of appeals' approach and its result in this case was wrong... that the Fourth Amendment simply doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.694" offset="5322911">Now, let me hasten to add... I mentioned this... I adverted to it before, I believe, Justice Stevens, in answer to one of your questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.857" offset="5351541">The fact that the Fourth Amendment doesn't provide the controlling restraints on conduct does not mean that all foreign nationals are out of luck when there is some kind of activity of American agents that is thought to be out of bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.217" offset="5404935">Congress has, and has in fact exercised the power to impose restraints on agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.321" offset="5429386">I referred before to 22 U.S.C. 2291(c) which restricts law enforcement officers in U.S. persons abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.801" offset="5483302">As I said before, also there can be treaties that restrain the exercise of American power overseas and I suppose as a fallback position as well the Due Process Clause, which again regulates the admission of evidence internally... a domestic restraint... may also exercise a protection of last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.754" offset="5571074">But even if the Fourth Amendment generally applies, we believe that the court of appeals erred in--</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.826" offset="5971374">Let me quickly address the Warrant Clause issue because it's our submission that even if the Fourth Amendment applies, surely the Warrant Clause does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.040" offset="6004289">The court of appeals reasoned that to relieve the government of the warrant requirement... quote... would be to treat foreign searches differently from domestic searches just because they are foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.327" offset="6045458">But, of course, foreign searches are different, and that's just the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.041" offset="6060295">They call for different treatment under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.615" offset="6070535">There are in this setting special needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement, and a warrant requirement is therefore inappropriate, and I say that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.631" offset="6106584">First, as this Court suggested in its Skinner decision, a warrant would do little to further the aims of the Warrant Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.833" offset="6131453">It would not empower the agents to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.146" offset="6140648">It would give them no authority in Mexico, or, to use the court of appeals', I think, elegant characterization, it would be a dead letter in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.792" offset="6171263">It would not provide meaningful protection on the scope of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.595" offset="6186519">And this case indicates just why that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.338" offset="6193415">Because the actual operation is apt to be in the control of the host country's officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.189" offset="6212850">And just as the Mexican commander ordered the agents to gather up the remaining documents and look at them later, so too can it not be expected that a warrant would have that confining force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.438" offset="6257885">Apart from the fact that a warrant could not fulfill its traditional missions, in this setting the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind this search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.614" offset="6298532">There is no U.S. magistrate who is authorized to issue one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.437" offset="6313892">We've still not been told by anybody who the agents were supposed to go to see in order to get this warrant that they were supposedly supposed to execute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.604" offset="6346493">A warrant would certainly interfere with their ability to do their job which requires them to obey the restrictions imposed by the host officials and not follow the competing agenda set by the United States magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.290" offset="6397275">In this case we believe the proper approach is one of reasonableness, the basic requirement of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.434" offset="6421830">And here the agents' behavior was evidently reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.448" offset="6437921">They sought approval at the highest levels of the Mexican government available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.151" offset="6452759">They secured that approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.813" offset="6459342">They participated with the Mexicans in the conduct of the search, and they obeyed the dictates imposed by the host during the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.729" offset="6487031">We believe, in short, that questions of extraterritoriality are not on/off switches, as the court of appeals supposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.515" offset="6518169">There is and must be considerable room for judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.089" offset="6528514">It this a territory in which constitutional protections makes sense?</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.371" offset="6545546">Is this claimant within the constitutional zone of interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.883" offset="6559652">Do the rights asserted lend themselves to overseas application and even if a right applies, must it apply in exactly the same way as it does domestically?</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.489" offset="6594029">These are complicated questions to be sure, but the court of appeals never asked them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.662" offset="6610747">It believed, instead, that the Constitution applies everywhere, to everyone, regardless of circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.877" offset="6635616">Had the court of appeals asked the right questions, it would not have suppressed the tally sheets in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.872" offset="6655574">This judgment should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.096" offset="13444485">On the assumption for now that the Fourth Amendment does apply, let me just say a couple of words about reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.663" offset="13482728">The first thing I want to say about that is that it does not turn on whether the agents have complied with Article 16 of the Mexican Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.976" offset="13511985">I have tried myself to read Article 16 of the Mexican Constitution several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.251" offset="13533092">I've quoted it at pages 11 and 12 of our Reply Brief in footnote 10 and our office has not been able to get a definitive sense of whether it applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.979" offset="13576037">It is very different from the Warrant Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.044" offset="13596308">It does not, for example, require probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.256" offset="13613131">It has, for example, an exception for searches for sanitary... to enforce the sanitary and police regulations, which under Mexican law, as we understand it, includes the narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.934" offset="13655867">The fact is, it's a different constitutional provision and what that really tells you is not so much does it apply or doesn't it apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.768" offset="13687214">But it's simply not plausible to suppose that agents executing law enforcement activities overseas should be conversant with the niceties of constitutional law of 150 different countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.629" offset="13742594">What counts is whether their activities, as the Chief Justice suggested in one of his questions, are objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.523" offset="13770179">And under any test, the activities of these agents was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.386" offset="13785644">They sought out approval at the highest levels of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.698" offset="13798914">They secured approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.299" offset="13805288">Let me just quickly say that these allegations of corruption are based on, for the most part, questions that didn't elicit the answers that counsel... defense counsel had hoped at the suppression hearing, and in any event are not the subject of any finding in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.831" offset="13879476">They secured the authorization.</text>
