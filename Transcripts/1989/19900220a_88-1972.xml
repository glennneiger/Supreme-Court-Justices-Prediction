            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="127517">We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1972, Illinois v. Lloyd Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="163879">Ms. Friedl, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marcia_l_friedl" startTime="57.920" stopTime="237.485">
            <label>Ms. Marcia L. Friedl</label>
            <text syncTime="57.920" offset="359171">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="61.122" offset="371919">This case comes from the Illinois Appellate Court which upheld the suppression of Defendant's murder confession on the Miranda grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.125" offset="395951">The ruling precludes the use of undercover agents to in any way question incarcerated suspects concerning criminal offenses that they may have committed and it ironically arises on facts which affirmatively establish that Defendant Perkins in this case perceived no pressures whatsoever to speak when making his incriminating statements, but, rather, he was simply killing time with boastful admissions to those whom he believed to be co-conspirators in a jail break.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.257" offset="500441">After detailing how the privilege against self-incrimination is seriously threatened whenever a suspect is subjected to the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation, this Court in Miranda developed prophylactic warnings and rules to provide practical reinforcement for the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.452" offset="569300">However, because the Miranda safeguards of a protective Fifth Amendment, and because they markedly decrease the number of wholly-reliable statements that are available to law enforcement for both investigation and prosecution purposes, this Court has characterized those safeguards as extraordinary and has consistently refused to apply them outside the context of the inherently compelling custodial interrogations for which they were designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.203" offset="672327">The Miranda's principal concern was that mutually reinforcing manifestations of police dominance arising from custodial interrogation will inevitably exert significant pressures on an accused to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.362" offset="732931">This concern is entirely inapposite to undercover elicitation statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.933" offset="755187">A suspect who is in immediate and non-transit control of a non-governmental authority who also at the same makes its interest at eliciting a statement apparent, might naturally believe that he has no right to speak because the... the authorities' power to eventually get what it wants is immediately suggested by its power of restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.299" offset="848706">And even if the subject is not subjected to any further incarceration, additional incarceration, above and beyond that of general incarceration itself, other potential pressures remain because the suspect will still... the inmate will still understand that speaking will accommodate an inquiring government that not only has the proven power of incarceration but also has future control over his physical environment, his prosecution and other aspects of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.722" offset="986319">Now, where a suspect doesn't know that he's encountering a governmental agent, he can feel absolutely none of these pressures, and any concern in Miranda for perceived governmental domination by the questioner which could even conceivably be reinforced by the governmental's power of incarceration is dispelled by the deception itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="872.256" offset="3616536">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="876.375" offset="3632941">As my colleague has pointed out, the police practice at issue in this case is categorically different from the one that the Court addressed in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.362" offset="3660944">Miranda addressed and was primarily concerned with the classic police stationhouse interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.282" offset="3684559">And the later cases have also been concerned with the functional equivalent of that... interrogation in the squad car or at the scene of the crime after a person has been arrested and handcuffed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="898.656" offset="3722070">How about Mathis?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="898.822" offset="3722802">Mathis involved the situation in which the person was in custody and questioned by a known government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.762" offset="3758537">It's the latter fact that is absent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.362" offset="3768882">Now, we've also taken the view in Point A in our brief that the mere fact that someone is in jail does not automatically mean he must be given Miranda warnings because the context in which there is some type of questioning should also be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.687" offset="3826247">But in this case the primary difference between the factual situation we have and what you had in Mathis was this was an undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.257" offset="3860519">As my colleague has pointed out, that really distinguishes this case greatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.495" offset="3877447">In fact, the fact that Respondent was in jail was really significant in this case for only two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.582" offset="3901793">One, it allowed the police to find him.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.351" offset="3912869">After all, the police tried to put Charlton and Respondent together outside of jail, at a motel, in order to find out if Respondent was responsible for the Stevenson murder, but Respondent was nowhere to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.909" offset="3963128">They found him in a jail and then they had to try something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.694" offset="3978279">Secondly, the fact that Respondent was in jail meant that Officer Parisi could approach him with a phony escape plan rather than use some other type of ruse, such as the ruse they would have used if they had found Respondent at the motel.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.286" offset="4036585">But the fact that he was in jail did not in any way coerce him into confessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.338" offset="4056856">Look at the case from his perspective and look at the setting in which he found himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.309" offset="4072738">Did Respondent confess in order to avoid having the book thrown at him by a known police officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.819" offset="4138776">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.746" offset="4098443">Respondent thought he was hatching an escape plot with two fellow prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.534" offset="4117564">Did Respondent confess because he believed that the agent had some authority to force him to confess?</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.788" offset="4142642">Respondent confessed because he believed that the agent was in fact vito bianco, a fellow hit man, who could be trusted with Respondent's secret.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.209" offset="4176288">Mr. Larkin, let me give you another hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.526" offset="4185587">Supposing he's in the interrogation room and they brought in a police officer and they passed him off as a newspaper reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.565" offset="4213695">So this newspaper reporter, he wants to interview you for some future story, and they sold him a bill of goods in selling the book rights, or something, to his story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.969" offset="4243370">Would that be permissible?</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.473" offset="4269388">If you don't have any real break, unlike here where you really do, then, as a practical matter, you could say that some of the intimidating presence of the police officer would immediately carry over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.912" offset="4311079">I mean, for example, if they brought a police officer disguised as a reporter in immediately after the defendant--</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.940" offset="4395194">And you just... instead of using a fellow inmate, you just use somebody dressed up as a reporter or a... or a... how about a priest?</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.173" offset="4968111">I mean, after all, the reason for having a police officer there is a big distinction, a crucial one, we believe... is that it was essential to Miranda that the suspect would know that the person sitting across the table from him in a police interrogation room was a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.766" offset="5026521">The police officer is the one who holds the suspect's fate in his hands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.139" offset="7776066">And I believe that's important because I believe the jail setting is the most important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.777" offset="7798531">This... this case does not involve simply an informant who hears something in the jail and then goes tells the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.549" offset="7837610">This case involves a specific designed plan to elicit incriminating remarks from the Defendant, Lloyd Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.691" offset="7882227">And this is not just something that was on the spur of the moment by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.393" offset="7901035">This is a thought-out plan to get at Lloyd Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.297" offset="7920679">It's been thought out for several weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.248" offset="7928412">And when they discovered that he was at the Montgomery County Jail in which he was incarcerated at the time for aggravated battery, they made the specific decision to get Agent Parisi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.293" offset="8000614">And I think that if you look at the plain holding of Miranda, you will see that this case falls squarely within the plain holding of Miranda in which Your Honors stated that these confessions or statements cannot be used unless there is demonstrated a knowing waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.799" offset="8142616">It's not that they were not able to go and talk to the Defendant Lloyd Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.720" offset="8174381">They were able to go and talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.322" offset="8180755">It's that they were not able to use that information unless they got a valid voluntary waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.909" offset="8207086">I don't think the state would contend at all that if a uniform police officer went to Lloyd Perkins in his cell and said, I want to talk to you, that he had to give Miranda to the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.152" offset="8264033">We see no difference between the uniformed police officer and the undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.424" offset="8297156">They are both agents, law enforcement agents of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.710" offset="8314293">They both have to follow the dictates of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.197" offset="8332265">Under Miranda there has to be questioning or interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.101" offset="8355879">I would suggest to this Court that that is amply demonstrated by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.969" offset="8375315">What happened is that Charlton and Parisi went to Lloyd Perkins, spun this tale and then started asking him questions specifically designed to grab the information that they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.014" offset="8443546">They did not sit around and just talk about the weather or talk about anything that was of no consequence and Lloyd Perkins blurted this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.370" offset="8480954">They talked about and they questioned specifically to get to what they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.123" offset="8507912">And when Lloyd Perkins might become quiet, they would chime in and ask another question designed specifically to bring something else out, something to be more incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.069" offset="8571755">And, of course, Miranda is concerned with their being a law enforcement agent involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.805" offset="8602684">It's not just the Fifth Amendment that is important because there was questioning and there was custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.411" offset="8633091">It's important because there's a governmental agent involved, not some private citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.482" offset="8653362">The key concern in Miranda is that the government has to be circumscribed in its conduct towards its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.255" offset="8688470">Here we definitely do have a law enforcement agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.290" offset="8708637">He was an undercover agent in the narcotics trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.361" offset="8724937">He was a police officer, and he was sworn to uphold the laws of the State of Illinois and the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.132" offset="8767987">The former Department of Corrections inmate, Charlton... by this time he had become a law enforcement agent because he was working hand-in-hand with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.809" offset="8822740">He was following the dictates and plans of the police and his only purpose within this ruse was to trick and cajole Lloyd Perkins into the confidence of Agent Parisi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.688" offset="8890240">We would also suggest that the concerns of the Court in Miranda, concerns that powered the decision of that Court, are present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.780" offset="8946560">In Miranda this Court was concerned about trickery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.982" offset="8963383">It was concerned about deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.767" offset="8970488">It was concerned about the police-dominated atmosphere of custody and jails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.338" offset="8996820">In Miranda this Court talked about the psychological ploys that could be employed and was very concerned about the psychological coercion exerted by the environment in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.217" offset="9064320">To touch upon a concern of Justice Marshall a little while ago, if this case is ripped out from the cover of Miranda, then you will simply have the police circumventing Miranda by using undercover agents in the old Mutt and Jeff technique in which now, instead of Jeff being the good cop, he has become the good companion, the good inmate, while Mutt is the terrifying police officer who sets up and produces the mental coercion in the defendant, in the accused, in which he becomes susceptible to the ploys and trickery of the undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.684" offset="9282181">If this Court removes the protections of Miranda from these situations, then you will simply have the forms of psychological coercion being moved into this arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.040" offset="9327635">Finally, I'd like to note that this Court has noted that this is a factual matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.396" offset="9357101">In Patterson v. Illinois, this Court noted that surreptitious conversations between an undercover police agent could be interrogation under Miranda and Miranda would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.619" offset="9405897">Under footnote 9 of Patterson, the issue is not whether Miranda applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.123" offset="9427945">The issue is the factual question of whether there is custody, whether there is interrogation and whether there is a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.313" offset="9464725">We have all three elements in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.998" offset="9479458">And that's what this Court has to focus upon, is those three elements of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.902" offset="9503073">Custody, interrogation and questioning, and the law enforcement officer initiating that questioning.</text>
