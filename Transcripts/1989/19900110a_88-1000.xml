            <label>Mr. Peter D. Coddington</label>
            <text syncTime="72.148" offset="424247">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.190" offset="436473">Your Honor, I know you're all aware of the facts in this case so I'm not going to dwell on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.093" offset="456117">Rather, we believe the New York Court of Appeals erred on four fronts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.928" offset="475447">And, if I may, I'd like to concentrate on our first two arguments primarily while I'm at this podium.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.103" offset="496136">We believe that the New York Court of Appeals misunderstood Brown and its progeny by holding that a precinct confession, totally voluntary, given outside of a man's house, should be suppressed because the police arrested him in his home without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.252" offset="560711">Now, I believe they misapplied Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.635" offset="570220">Brown merely holds that Mirandas will not attenuate a Fourth Amendment violation in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.191" offset="604492">The opinion says so, that Miranda warnings by themselves will not always attenuate.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.905" offset="623300">However, Brown also did not adopt any "but for" standard... but for a Fourth Amendment violation a confession so be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.291" offset="664887">Brown, Taylor and Dunaway, the three cases on which the court of appeals relied, hold merely that when the confession is the product of prolonged involuntary detention without probable cause, then a confession should be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.653" offset="730298">In those cases, the confession comes as a result of the Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.136" offset="752241">That is, holding a man without probable cause in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.269" offset="772825">Where, however, in a case like this where there is ample probable cause, I submit that the vice that led to the Brown, Dunaway and Taylor holdings is absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.615" offset="810128">Once this man was taken outside of his house, the detention was completely lawful for Forth Amendment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.940" offset="835415">Therefore, the perfectly voluntary confession given later at a public place, the police precinct, I submit should have been admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.134" offset="864254">Now--</text>

            <text syncTime="187.940" offset="887451">What I mean is do you agree with what I think is the Solicitor General's position in his brief that the vice of... going inside the house in this case to arrest the person was that you might have seen things inside the house that could be used as evidence, not the mission to... to arrest him?</text>

            <text syncTime="224.707" offset="1034572">Well, but just... but just on the first point, to follow-up to the Chief Justice's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.299" offset="1044917">If you assume that the rule is you must exclude the statement that's given in the house, then do you make the same argument here?</text>
            <text syncTime="235.782" offset="1078876">Or is it just a factual inquiry as to whether or not there's... the taint's been attenuated?</text>

            <text syncTime="240.166" offset="1096326">--Well, I believe we get into attenuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.739" offset="1110641">With respect to the Brown holding, my position is that if there is probable cause, Miranda warnings by themselves should attenuate and there's no need to go through the three-fold factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.147" offset="1152332">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.969" offset="1155571">But I also agree that the Payton rule... I think there should be a bright-line rule here that Payton applies to evidence that is seized or perhaps observed in the home, and that evidence that is taken outside the home should not be suppressed as a violation of Payton.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.280" offset="1212832">If that answers Your Honor's question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.245" offset="5484688">I mean, there are violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.366" offset="5493152">For example, take United States v. Leon where the taint is the good-faith reliance on what turns out to be an invalid award.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.302" offset="5532858">I mean, now, there is a violation that's not flagrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.594" offset="5542053">The same may be said of Crews and Ceccolini and in Michigan v. Tucker where the Fourth Amendment violation leads to the testimony of a live witness.</text>

            <label>Mr. Barrington D. Parker, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1397.665" offset="5726373">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.498" offset="5793664">On January 16th, 1984 three New York City police officers, each with 18 years experience on the force, went to Bernard Harris' home both to question him and to arrest him in connection with a homicide five days earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.310" offset="5868897">Five days earlier, on the 11th, the police officers, specifically Detective Rivers who was in charge of the investigation, had probable cause to arrest Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.152" offset="5924277">In addition, they knew on that day, the 11th, where he lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.325" offset="5940995">The officers were apparently not concerned that Harris was a threat to anybody else, nor were they concerned that he might flee because between the 11th and the 16th, insofar as the record shows, they made no effort at all to apprehend him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.309" offset="6016959">Now, the specific purpose in going to Mr. Harris' house was to question him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.941" offset="6043500">Both officers testified to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.754" offset="6050709">McCarthy and his partner, Rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.816" offset="6062935">Both of these were 16-year detectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.597" offset="6074115">The officers did not have a warrant, no effort had been made to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.543" offset="6109851">Furthermore, the record shows... excuse me... the record does not suggest that the arresting officers in connection with their efforts to arrest Mr. Harris went anywhere other than to his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.396" offset="6177247">Now, obviously the police officers in this case are presumed to have knowledge of and be bound by the district court's decision in Payton, a decision which, of course, in the first instance talked directly to New York City Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.250" offset="6256659">In addition, there is a memorandum which is not part of the record but which is quoted in the state's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.417" offset="6301380">That memorandum apparently was circulated to all police department... all police force members and specifically to detectives at about the time Payton was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.727" offset="6358641">So, I think the record is clear that these officers knew what Payton required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.602" offset="6390092">So, it was after dark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.073" offset="6395944">There were no exigent circumstances at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.295" offset="6408900">And although the arrest took place four years after this Court's decision, Detective Rivers, the 18-year veteran, testified that it was not the custom in his department to comply with what this Court said the Fourth Amendment required in Payton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.870" offset="6487163">He was asked by the court if it was the custom in his department to get warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.805" offset="6518928">Detective Rivers said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.417" offset="6533348">And I suggest to this Court that there is nothing in the record which contradicts or qualifies Detective Rivers' admission about the existence and the application of the custom.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.327" offset="8029015">They can be illegal because there happens to be no warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.031" offset="8047823">I believe that there is no good policy reason to focus on one type of arrest and exclude another type of arrest that because of the circumstances might be more flagrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.342" offset="8117100">What you have in the usual circumstance of no... what it seems to me complicates the cases involving arrests without probable cause is this Court's recognition of the difficulties police officers have in making spontaneous or difficult on-the-spot judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.659" offset="8222321">But here we don't have that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2031.347" offset="8261087">It... it, I would suggest, creates a substantially more compelling justification for the absence... excuse me, for the application of an exclusionary rule than Brown, Taylor and Dunaway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.818" offset="11466938">If I may, I'd like to begin by answering Justice White's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.933" offset="11483447">I submit that the precinct confession here is by no means the product of the entry at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.455" offset="11505495">I think the Payton violation here is completely addressed the seizing whatever evidence might have been found in the house, and to extend it further than that I think would be to apply a "but for" rule which this Court in Brown said was not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.396" offset="11573309">So, I submit that it is not a product whatsoever of the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.039" offset="11587833">And I think in terms of attenuation you can look to the second statement for evidence of attenuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.973" offset="11611552">It was much more... much more detailed than the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.545" offset="11621896">The first statement essentially said, I killed her because she was an unfit mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.209" offset="11636525">The second statement, about an hour later, went through the detail of the prior affair with her, the abduction, that she lied to him, so on and so forth, and none of these details were given to the defendant by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.046" offset="11683859">This all came from his own recollection, his own independent act of free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.220" offset="11700577">That's what I believe attenuates this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.203" offset="11716460">With respect to the time factor, here it's about an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.245" offset="11736731">In Rawlings I believe it was about 45 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.377" offset="11749165">So, I mean, there is precedent in this Court's opinions for the time factor serving the effects of attenuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.831" offset="11779049">Finally, back to the non-policy... I'll call it... of the New York state police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.675" offset="11802350">Remember, in the record only one police officer testified that it was the custom to not get warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.722" offset="11834638">McCarthy at joint appendix page 8 said that if the defendant hadn't opened the door, he'd have left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.548" offset="11857939">Rivers himself at page 380 of the record testified that he'd been there once before.</text>
