            <text syncTime="14.224" offset="205897">Mr. Schultz, you may proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="25.531" offset="251142">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="268069">This case seeks review of a decision former Attorney General Edwin Meese to grant a joint operating arrangement, or JOA, to the seventh and eighth largest newspapers in the country, the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.231" offset="341943">The JOA would allow the papers to jointly set circulation and advertising prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.651" offset="371618">It would also allow them to divide the Detroit market so that the Free Press would be the morning paper and the News would be the afternoon paper and they would publish a joint weekend edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.310" offset="422191">Such an agreement would ordinarily violate the antitrust laws, but in 1970 Congress adopted the Newspaper Preservation Act which gave the Attorney General the authority to grant an antitrust exemption to newspapers in limited circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.737" offset="487915">Petitioners' challenge is based on three arguments, each of which I will address.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.158" offset="513620">The first is that the joint operating agreement here is not consistent with the purposes, structure and policies of the Newspaper Preservation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.949" offset="560849">Second, the record here does not support the Attorney General's finding that the Free Press was in probable danger of financial failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.987" offset="597003">And third, the court of appeals erred in not applying the rule that antitrust exemptions must be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.843" offset="632425">Before I get to those legal issues, there are three critical facts that I would like to highlight that distinguish this case from every other JOA application.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.503" offset="682998">Each of these facts was either adopted by the Attorney General or by the administrative law judge whose fact-findings the Attorney General accepted, and, therefore, they are established facts for purposes of the legal issues here.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="193.372" offset="922488">So on the factual issues it would be arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.891" offset="932519">On the legal issues it would be whether there's a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.945" offset="948820">The first of these critical facts is that the newspapers fought the competitive battle in Detroit to a virtual draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.801" offset="984242">Those are their words as they described the competitive situation at the time they announced the JOA.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.620" offset="1015484">And this assessment establishes that the papers considered themselves to be competitive equals.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.441" offset="1042756">The... Free... the record shows that the Free Press had been losing money and that the News... the News had been losing almost as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.630" offset="1071491">It shows that the daily circulation of the two papers was roughly equal, and in other areas each had advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.653" offset="1103569">The News was ahead in advertising, but on the other hand, this was offset by the fact that the Free Press had the morning franchise, had clear dominance in the morning franchise, which was considered a major advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.044" offset="1153202">And also important is the fact for at least ten years there had been no movement in the relative market position of these two papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.065" offset="1185280">This situation, this whole set of facts, distinguishes the JOA here from every one... other one previously considered and approved by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.041" offset="1233137">In each of those other situations, there was one paper that was dominant and profitable and a second paper that was junior, losing money and had been losing both circulation and advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.682" offset="1283710">Well, the only difference here from that fact that if... you just recited is that it wasn't losing circulation but it was losing money year after year, was it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="320.038" offset="1429159">They are at the same level, and that it hadn't changed, that the circulation and advertising had not changed over ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.643" offset="1467612">They'd been fighting for that, and... and that's very different from what we see--</text>

            <text syncTime="334.464" offset="1486838">It's different, but maybe I was jumping ahead of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.297" offset="1494152">I thought the reason you thought it was different is that it indicates in this situation a stable, you know, a stable competitive arrangement, whereas in the other situations there was not a stable arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.657" offset="1547651">It... it seemed to be deteriorating.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="359.013" offset="1585058">--Well, the papers obviously don't want to lose money.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.565" offset="1603239">That's not a good thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.848" offset="1608359">But the question is, is the Detroit Free Press in probable danger of failing financially?</text>
            <text syncTime="371.335" offset="1634377">Is it in probable danger of... of closing?</text>
            <text syncTime="373.787" offset="1644199">And I am simply saying that the fact that they're competitive equals suggests that... that that's not the case, particularly when you consider the reason that the Free Press and the News are losing money.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.510" offset="1703027">They're not losing money because of any problem with the market in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.164" offset="1725702">The Attorney General found that the market in Detroit could support two healthy newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.770" offset="1752033">Instead, everyone has agreed that they are losing money because their prices are too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.258" offset="1774080">The... the newsstand price for the Detroit News is 15 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.626" offset="1795501">The newsstand price for the Free Press is 20 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.197" offset="1809816">Similarly, advertising prices are the lowest in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.232" offset="1825907">And so this is not a... a situation as we've seen in other cities where, again, where one's making money and one's losing.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.854" offset="1864464">They're losing money because the prices are too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.206" offset="1873868">And just to highlight this, the fact that they regarded each other as competitive equals, when they drew up the joint operating arrangement they made a decision to split profits 50-50.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.049" offset="1937189">This, in our view, is further and very strong evidence that the papers regarded themselves as competitively equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.655" offset="1967595">It's strong evidence that the News did not think that the Free Press was likely to go out of business anytime soon because, after all, if it viewed the Free Press as being likely to close down in the near future, it would have made no sense for it to have split these enormous possible monopoly profits evenly.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.252" offset="2050038">Again, the profit split here contrasts dramatically with the profit split that was evident in other JOAs approved by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.543" offset="2095177">Each one of those involved a lopsided profit split, where the dominant profitable paper took most of the profits and the junior paper took a much smaller percentage, under 30 percent in every case.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="502.886" offset="2160588">On that kind of reasoning, you would automatically invalidate any... any JOA that's approved by the Justice Department which ends up in a... in a 50-50 split, I suppose?</text>

            <text syncTime="513.110" offset="2201444">I don't know that I would automatically invalidate it, but I would be very skeptical of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.264" offset="2230074">There is one situation I can think of where it might be appropriate, and that would be the situation where there was a finding that the market could support only one paper, and also if there was a... there might be some other facts that were different here, but if there was kind of finding it would be a stronger place.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.678" offset="2307710">But I... I do regard--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="540.694" offset="2311785">What is the usual split?</text>
            <text syncTime="541.394" offset="2314606">I don't... I don't know what these... how these things... I mean, is it... is it unusual to have a 50-50 split like that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_b_schultz" startTime="547.348" stopTime="600.882">
            <label>Mr. William B. Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="547.348" offset="2338430">--In terms of the JOAs after 1970, which is... those are the only ones that have been approved by the Attorney General, the profit splits have been between 80/20 and, I think, 68/32.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.857" offset="2400392">That's the range of the other JOA.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.393" offset="2406557">So this is very unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.328" offset="2414289">Now there were some 50-50 profit splits in the old JOAs, but, of course, those are evaluated under a much different standard, and they were entered at a time when there was no requirement that there be a showing that one of the newspapers be in probable danger of... of financial failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.838" offset="2480327">So, in the circumstances of a market that can support two newspapers, we would argue that where there's a 50-50 profit split and other evidence that the papers are competitively equal, that the newspapers cannot qualify for approval of a joint operating agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.363" offset="2734446">And one of the troubling... one of the most troubling aspects of the JOA here is that its approval, the approval of the JOA in Detroit, the one at issue in this case, will result in a loss of competition in other healthy competitive markets in the United States, which would be contrary to the purpose of the Newspaper Preservation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.728" offset="2827964">After the statute, there are three possibilities that can occur in competitive newspaper markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.966" offset="2852833">They can end up with full competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.584" offset="2863386">They could end up with a JOA, or they could end up with a monopoly, single monopoly paper and no competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.867" offset="2964428">The second choice is a JOA which retains two newspapers but eliminates commercial competition, and the least desirable outcome is a single monopoly paper where competition is eliminated altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.489" offset="3227011">It's not something we've highlighted, because he didn't either.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.560" offset="3251253">The Newspaper Preservation Act expresses a strong policy preference for full competition over a JOA in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.903" offset="3308617">First of all, Congress adopted a very narrow definition for the term "failing paper".</text>
            <text syncTime="796.241" offset="3334008">Secondly, in the purpose section of the statute it refers to the interest in newspapers that are competitive in all parts of the United States, and then it explicitly required the Attorney General to find that any JOA he approve was consistent with those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.137" offset="3409555">And, finally, the antitrust rule that exemptions from the antitrust laws be narrowly construed has the effect of retaining the full force of the antitrust laws as much as possible where the exemptions don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.599" offset="3479354">Therefore, one of the underlying policies of the Newspaper Preservation Act is that it cannot be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.503" offset="3511014">It may not be interpreted in a way that will give incentives in other markets and result in healthy competitive markets being converted into markets where newspapers operate under JOAs approved by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.881" offset="3580500">Here the Attorney General's decision violates that policy because essentially it creates a road map under which newspapers in healthy competitive markets can obtain a JOA, and all they have to do under that decision is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.176" offset="3645702">The first step is for one of the papers to cut prices as happened in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.330" offset="3670361">That presumably will be followed by a price cut by the other paper, by the second paper, which would be necessary in order not to lose circulation in advertising, and those price cuts would be followed by several years of losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.637" offset="3723546">That was precisely the situation in Detroit when the application was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.124" offset="3741519">Then the papers filed their application for a joint operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.445" offset="3762835">They have to identify one newspaper as failing.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.230" offset="3773911">Presumably they would identify the paper that was behind in circulation or advertising or if one newspaper had substantially more losses, they would find a junior paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.670" offset="3811631">But if the papers are equal, they can identify either one under the Attorney General's decision because that was the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.840" offset="3844337">Accompanying the application would have to be the testimony from officials of the paper not designated as failing that they will not raise their prices even if the exemption is not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.999" offset="3900970">Well, that testimony should not be hard to get, given the interest that those officials have, and for good measure they can add the testimony from officials of the failing paper that that paper will close if the JOA isn't granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.859" offset="3960425">That testimony also was presented in the case of the Detroit application.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.580" offset="3983308">And, thus, the risk of the decision is that it will result in the artificial generation of joint operating agreements in other markets around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.055" offset="4025208">Newspapers have... the problem is... is enhanced by the fact that newspapers have a terrific incentive to try and obtain approval of joint operating arrangements, and this can also be seen from the facts of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.064" offset="4085290">In Detroit neither of these newspapers has ever made more than $15 million a year, and of course there are many years during which each has made far less.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.770" offset="4124056">Yet Gannett predicts that if the JOA is approved, by the fifth year the newspapers jointly will be making $100 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.228" offset="4165956">So, you can see that the profit possibilities are enormous and thus, if newspapers in... in other markets are given a way that they can obtain a JOA through something as simple as price cuts--</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.645" offset="8283586">And no one that did take part in the administrative proceedings raised any claim about predatory pricing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.831" offset="8400301">I don't think they can quite have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.550" offset="8415243">Let me... let me try if I might just to go back again to what I think the Attorney General relied on, but to point out that the findings of the Attorney General, he made what I believe to be four critical factual determinations in this case, were... were reviewed by the district court... United States District Court... and by the court of appeals and were upheld by both of those courts, and it's quite well established that this Court does not ordinarily undertake to review the factual determinations of two concurrent lower courts obvious... absent some very obvious or exceptional showing of error, and we don't think that anything the Petitioners have presented in this case can constitute something of that magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.139" offset="8561528">Let me mention briefly the four facts that the Attorney General relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.341" offset="8574381">First, which has already been mentioned, the Detroit Free Press, which was indicated to be the failing newspaper, had lost consistently over a seven-year period substantial sums of money amounting in total to some $83 million from 1979 to 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.517" offset="8635089">The losses went up during that period every year except one, so they are steadily mounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.754" offset="8655987">That's undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.538" offset="8659122">The ALJ found that... the Attorney General found that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.740" offset="8671974">Petitioners don't challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.206" offset="8677826">Second, the Attorney General agreed with the conclusion of both the antitrust division, which testified to this point, and the ALJ that the Free Press had no way unilaterally to extricate itself from this pattern of ever-deepening losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.750" offset="8736026">The Attorney General in fact specifically instructed the administrative law judge to look into the options that the Free Press had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.867" offset="8756506">The administrative law judge devotes 18 pages of his opinion to an analysis of all the various courses of action that might be available to the Free Press in order to extricate itself from the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.509" offset="8795063">He concludes that none of those options... raising prices of the newspaper, raising advertising rates, changes in management, anything else... none of it was realistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.365" offset="8830485">And that's really undisputed, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.498" offset="8834978">Petitioners, despite their quibbling, have not directly challenged that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.167" offset="8853682">Third, and we've already touched on this, the Attorney General disagreed with the ALJ with respect to the probability that the News would not raise its prices in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.308" offset="8894224">He thought that given everything in the record, that it would hardly reflect unsound business judgment for the News not to raise its prices with so many indications that the Free Press had already abandoned any hope of... of maintaining market dominance--</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.445" offset="9230786">First of all, they would look at the fact that they have... earn 60 percent of the total advertising revenues in this market and the Free Press only 40 percent, that they have real strengths in the revenue... and that's... 75 percent of the newspaper's revenue, is advertising... and they have considerable strengths.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.573" offset="9295256">For example, the News has consistently maintained 70 percent of the classified advertising in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.060" offset="9321274">But it's not just the fact that they have those strengths, it's also the fact, you must recall, that throughout this period, and I'm talking now from '83-'84 to '85-'86, when the Free Press has basically broken off JOA discussions with Evening News Association, the closely-held company that then ran the News, and has initiated this thing called Operation Tiger, where the Free Press is trying everything it possibly can to improve the quality of its newspaper in order to improve its position in the Detroit market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.865" offset="9448438">The Free Press has throughout this period has... it brought in a new management team.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.852" offset="9468395">They brought in their team from Philadelphia that in fact had won the newspaper war there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.721" offset="9487935">They invested $22 million in a new publishing plant in the Detroit riverfront, which is designed to go out and get papers out faster and with better quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.410" offset="9522626">They do many things to improve the quality of the papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.712" offset="9531821">They have more sports coverage, more international coverage, more color graphics and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.766" offset="9552092">They put a total... the Chairman testifies they put a total of $176 million of cash from 1977 through 1985 or '86 into the Free Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.752" offset="9583961">What happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.704" offset="9591798">They don't really put... they don't really change the numbers at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.656" offset="9603605">If you look at the various tables in the ALJ's opinions that... that talk about circulation, circulation in the primary market area, circulation on Sunday, the advertising revenue figures, they're all quite constant throughout this period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2801.934" offset="11356735">It seems to me that the first thing you'd want to ask yourself before you plunge down some road examining the nuances of the Chevron doctrine is, is there a disputed question of law in this case wherein the administrative decision-maker decided that the statute meant one thing, and the petitioners are claiming it means something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.794" offset="11424131">And petitioners obviously disagree with this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.662" offset="11435625">They think it's arbitrary and capricious, but I'm having great difficulty... a great deal of difficulty... ascertaining exactly wherein they think the Attorney General adopted a construction of the Newspaper Preservation Act which is contrary to the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.922" offset="11496647">Judge Silberman, interestingly enough, thought that the point of disagreement was that petitioners were maintaining that you couldn't get a joint operating agreement unless you were in a downward spiral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.527" offset="11539070">He though that they were advocating a kind of per se rule, that you construe the statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.597" offset="11563416">The fact the petitioners disavowed that construction in the court of appeals in their reply brief... and they don't seem to press it in this particular... in this court, so that the issue that Judge Silberman used as his jumping off point for engaging in this Chevron discussion is based on what petitioners have said so far, really not presented in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.659" offset="11635618">And so I think the court before it starts talking about Chevron... I think this is perhaps where Judge Silberman made his mistake... first ought to identify the legal issue, in fact, that requires that kind of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.117" offset="11673444">I would say the same thing about the canons of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.383" offset="11682534">The exceptions to the antitrust laws should be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.669" offset="11691729">Canons of construction are used for resolving legal issues, questions of legal interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.239" offset="11713986">They're not sort of general standards of review that we apply in... in cases involving questions of the application of law to particular factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.697" offset="11759752">Just to go back very briefly to the Attorney General's factual determinations, the four determinations that the papers are losing money, the Free Press has no unilateral way out, the News is unlikely to raise its prices, and the paper's engaged in entirely proper activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.040" offset="11821192">It seems to me that if you accept those four factual determinations... and under the two court rule I think the court really has to accept those two factual determinations... there can't be any really serious contention that this decision was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.014" offset="11869048">The first three findings, I think, establish really without any doubt, that the Free Press has to be regarded as a failing newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.037" offset="11901127">The act defines a failing newspaper as one which, regardless of its ownership and affiliations, is in probable danger of financial failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.225" offset="11941878">The only previous court to have considered what that language means, the Ninth Circuit decision in the Hearst case, said that that should be interested to mean that the newspaper is suffering losses which more than likely cannot be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.383" offset="11990570">The Attorney General specifically adopted that as his understanding of what the statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.437" offset="12006766">Well, if the Free Press has lost money for seven years, if they have no way unilaterally to get out of the situation, and if their arch rival, the News, is not going to let them off the hook, it seems to me that you can't draw any conclusion except that they are in a probable danger of financial failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.031" offset="12069146">And with respect to policies and purposes, I think the finding by the Attorney General that the newspapers had engaged in entirely lawful, responsible competition really defeats any claim that they... that the application should be denied on policies and purposes grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.158" offset="12137587">Obviously if the Free Press is going to fail, the primary policy and purpose of the statute is to preserve independent editorial voices, and that policy is clearly fulfilled by granting the application in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.716" offset="12187847">The Attorney General went beyond the... the one policy and purpose that the statute mentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.752" offset="12204043">He also said that it was... that the general considerations of competition policy should be taken into account also, and I think that also has been satisfied here by his finding because I think it should be taken to mean that no anticompetitive conduct was responsible for the losses that these newspapers incurred in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.658" offset="12339671">I overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.393" offset="12354613">Let me... let me just try to bring up one final point here, which I don't think has gotten enough emphasis in the argument this morning or this afternoon, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.185" offset="12393692">The petitioners talk a lot about the importance of the policy of the antitrust laws, pro-competition policy, the economic efficiency objectives that are obviously reflected in those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.206" offset="12433816">But there's another policy, I think, that Congress was concerned about in this case, and I think it's one that Congress thought was more important than the policies of economic competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.979" offset="12468924">That, of course, is the policy of trying to preserve two or more editorial voices, independent editorial voices in communities that otherwise would be denied them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.768" offset="12504033">Congress heard a lot of evidence about the decline of the newspaper industry, the decline of junior newspapers, which is really quite distressing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.691" offset="12539768">In 1910, 60 percent of American communities had two or more independent competing daily papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.862" offset="12568503">By 1968, shortly before this act was passed, that had fallen to below 5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.265" offset="12590028">And the record in this case indicates that if anything, the trend has simply continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.050" offset="12605179">We now in this country have about 1,500 cities with one newspaper owner and 25 cities with two or more newspapers that are independently owned and competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.875" offset="12656484">And so, I think when the Attorney General was making his decision, he was very cognizant of the fact that Congress' primary concern here was to make sure that wherever possible... and there's not very many places where it's still possible... but wherever possible, that two or more editorial voices be maintained, even if that means giving up a little bit on the otherwise unalloyed economic competition that would exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.556" offset="12751256">Well, that's precisely what troubles me about this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.342" offset="12762332">I mean, apart from whether it's right or wrong, you begin with the finding that this city will support two separate newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.281" offset="12794097">And it seems to me once you make that finding, why would you ever want to grant a joint operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.102" offset="12817398">I mean, usually you're dealing with a city that can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.720" offset="12827847">Here you go in and say, this city can have two completely independent newspapers, but since it can't have two independent newspapers, we'll grant a joint operating agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.564" offset="12891272">For example, since this Act was passed in 1970, its second newspaper, junior newspapers have gone out of business in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Buffalo... all fairly large cities... not that different from Detroit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.706" offset="12951876">I don't understand what "could support" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.608" offset="12959399">I thought "could support" meant that in full and fair competition, more than one would survive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.262" offset="12986044">A "could support", I think, in the petitioner's use of it means that if there was some kind of pricing czar who was able to somehow intercede and determine what the prices of these newspapers ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.035" offset="13025124">There are circulation prices and advertising prices, then they could make money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.372" offset="13042469">Unfortunately, there is no such thing in the competition situation, where the two newspapers are desperately trying to avoid the downward spiral; to avoid having their circulation begin to slip, and have their advertising revenue start to fall off and all of sudden, they are out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.881" offset="13108506">In that sort of situation, the competitive reality is that the papers will not price at levels which are sufficient for the two of them to last.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.006" offset="13145078">That was true, for example... if Congress was aware that in New York City, which is the biggest newspaper market in the country, there had been quite a number of newspaper failures, notwithstanding the fact that clearly that's not a situation where there's not sufficient revenues to sustain at some level pricing, more than one newspaper.</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.887" offset="13244552">It is unusual, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.573" offset="13251344">In Philadelphia, is the situation that both the news and the free press were looking at over their shoulders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.275" offset="13274123">In Philadelphia you had, at one time, a dominant evening paper, The Bulletin, I think it was, and a struggling morning paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.964" offset="13308813">The morning paper, incidentally, was owned by Knight-Ridder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.433" offset="13318740">Knight-Ridder was able to turn that situation around after six years of losses, and the Bulletin eventually went into a tailspin and went out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.272" offset="13354057">So I think there were certain clear parallels between Philadelphia and Detroit, that both these papers were looking at throughout this period of time, and it explains, I think, largely why they were competing the way they were in order to try and maintain at all costs their market shares, and that led to the losses that made them unprofitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.666" offset="13427618">If there are no further questions, I thank the Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="3325.756" offset="13452069">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.339" offset="13454368">Just three points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.974" offset="13472862">First of all, these various facts that the Attorney General and Mr. Merrill have picked out of the record are all rebutted by the 50-50 profit split.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.099" offset="13513404">They can't get away from the fact that the newspapers themselves describe their equal competitive positions and how they divided profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.120" offset="13549453">Second, on the issue of whether Detroit can support two profitable newspapers, the Attorney General found this is not a situation where one of these papers is failing because it's on a downward spiral or losing advertising and circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.130" offset="13613506">He didn't find any of the situations that typically accompany a failing newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.884" offset="13636493">He found that Detroit can support two profitable newspapers if prices are at market, so that focuses the whole case on the issue of price and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.592" offset="13679334">And thirdly, the statute has an explicit requirement that the Attorney General find that the joint operating agreement is consistent with the policies of the Newspaper Preservation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.816" offset="13732311">So this is not the situation of having so many cases where you're arguing about the agency's policies versus the Court's policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.355" offset="13766374">Congress here identified what the policies are, and they identified the policy of competition in all parts of the United States, and the policy that they identified is consistent with the canon of anti-trust law that requires that exceptions being narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.301" offset="13838159">And if that canon is applied, as the court of appeals held, then the Attorney General's decision must be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.756" offset="13872013">Thank you.</text>
