            <text syncTime="15.491" offset="208311">This case is before the Court on certiorari for the Supreme Court of North Carolina to review the Supreme Court of North Carolina's decision affirming Dock McKoy's death sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="37.535" offset="296396">At the penalty phase trial in that case, the court instructed the jury that it must be unanimous to find a mitigating circumstance, and that if the jury was not unanimous on a particular circumstance it should answer that issue no.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.029" offset="370375">Further, the court offered no instruction to the jury at the penalty phase urging them to try to agree if there were any disagreements, initial disagreements, about a mitigating circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="76.121" offset="450832">The state concedes, and the North Carolina Supreme Court held, that the instructions in this case would require 12 jurors to find mitigation, but only one to reject it.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.758" offset="2557347">So that, in this case, different from Mills, there are really two layers of possible arbitrary action by the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.244" offset="2647312">And in fact, so mitigating that they would impose a life sentence if they could consider that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.880" offset="2669778">But one juror can find, in the jury room, in secret, that that circumstance, to his mind, is not mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.767" offset="2713350">And on that basis, the evidence... the jury has to decide the case without considering that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.312" offset="2739577">And that can be so even though that 12th juror might believe there is some other mitigating circumstance in the case upon which basis that juror would vote for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.371" offset="2783776">But because that is not unanimous, all 12, if they were allowed to consider the mitigation each of the 12 believes, would vote for life.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.510" offset="3528370">I don't think the cure for that is to allow black ball of mitigation in another case, in Dock McKoy's case, and... and allow a defendant to get a death sentence in a case where it is not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.319" offset="3583541">You know, the... the requirement that the jury be unanimous as to aggravation and the requirement that the jury be unanimous as to mitigation was a decision that is not in our statute; it was a decision that was made by the North Carolina Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.856" offset="4149771">They thought better of it and changed it so that now in Maryland if there is a hung jury they go back and have another sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.879" offset="4181849">If the state is concerned about reliability and concerned to the extent that they think that unanimity is required for a finding of mitigating circumstances, then there's a... there's a certain cost to that, I think, in efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.413" offset="4255933">There are going to be more hung juries if you have true unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.384" offset="4271815">But our point is simply if it is very important, for instance for this jury to decide whether Dock McKoy had a mental disturbance at the time that this crime occurred... well, it's important, the jury's decision that that is true is important, but the jury's decision that that is not true is equally important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.099" offset="4358646">Because what they are deciding is not merely that a burden has not been met.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.794" offset="4497513">Or there is another suggestion that would be more efficient, and that is to allow... continue to direct the jurors to the mitigating circumstances, even let the jurors vote on the mitigating circumstances, but those jurors who do not command a unanimous verdict on a mitigating circumstance can simply consider that in steps 3 and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.570" offset="4592599">In other words, just simply allow those jurors to consider the mitigation that those jurors would find, those 11 jurors would find, allow them to consider it at the final sentencing stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.311" offset="6435590">The issue here, as in several other cases now before this Court, deals with the state's right to have a sentencer rationally assess evidence, or plead for life sentence instead of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.780" offset="6489402">McKoy versus North Carolina specifically involves whether a state may hold the defendant to a burden of proving his mitigation with a reasonable certainty to the entire sentencing body, the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.290" offset="6539453">In North Carolina, just as aggravating factors must be found by all jurors or they are considered not to exist, North Carolina has made the policy determination to have symmetry, so that likewise the mitigation must be found by all jurors, or it likewise does not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.451" offset="6716145">I understood Mills to be concerned with the issue of ambiguous jury instructions in a very different system, a system where the no vote by one juror on mitigation could force a death penalty without any kind of further consideration of the appropriateness of the death penalty by the rest of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.817" offset="6813529">This is not present in North Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.447" offset="7260119">The jury cannot even vote about whether they consider the aggravating sufficiently substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.343" offset="7283629">In Maryland the statute ends with the weighing process and does not go on to that fourth step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.565" offset="7308602">North Carolina is unique, or almost unique, among the states in having this type of step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.960" offset="7338173">Therefore, we feel that this kind of burden of proof does not raise any of the dangers of arbitrariness which possibly could have resulted from a Maryland burden of proof of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.728" offset="7385193">So, for that reason alone we find it, a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.521" offset="7400344">Further, North Carolina, as a matter of state policy unlike Maryland, has determined, as a matter of our state law, that evidence ceases to be used in the balancing process once it is found insufficiently reliable to support a mitigating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.115" offset="7474741">And, as Justice Blackmun noted in footnote 7, the Maryland court had taken the opposite tack on that, so we say that this is another state law rule which does distinguish these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.824" offset="7589575">But if the jury were to consider the fact that the defendant was 16 years old and had military service, say... or maybe he couldn't do that if he was just 16... but say two or three factors like that, and... and if they were in the balance there would be great doubt about whether there would, the aggravating would outweigh the mitigating.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.364" offset="11771779">Our court looks not only to the aggravating factors found in determining whether this is a proportionate sentence, but they also look to all of the issues found in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.653" offset="11820889">Indeed, this is probably why they started urging us to keep these findings, so that they could look to the cases where life was found, as well as the cases where death was returned, to ensure that this case fell within that core of cases, more appropriately life or more appropriately death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.866" offset="11905735">The issue of unanimity is important because burdens on the defendant, as well as on the state, tend to force the jury at both places to follow channeling, follow reliable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.783" offset="11993402">So that... so that those people who get life, and those people who get death, get that in accordance with rules, as opposed to a free-floating whimsy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.346" offset="12135717">The Eighth Amendment has never said that its goal was the minimum number of death sentences possible, but rather, to the extent we can, the issues that we're trying to deal with by these sentences... by these... these evidentiary rules, are to ensure that one person doesn't get the death penalty on the same basis that another person would, trying to bring rationality into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.526" offset="12256403">The jury, after hearing an individual's evidence, by having this... this standard, and if we are going to have aggravation found by this standard, the need for symmetry is such that we do need this type of rule, the jury, after hearing an individual's evidence, will have a standard to follow in assessing the evidence's believability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3667.747" offset="14817239">Yes, but, apparently the jury is instructed that if there are no mitigating circumstances and there are aggravating circumstances, that they still have to determine whether those aggravating circumstances are sufficiently substantial to justify giving the death penalty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm Ray Hunter, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3695.428" offset="14927998">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.559" offset="14928520">There is another layer, but it is only a reconsideration of the aggravating circumstances that were found, plus if any mitigating circumstances were found, consideration of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.074" offset="14962584">This Court has never held that because we are very solicitous about the consideration of aggravation, for instance in Sumner and Roberts are two cases that... that occur to me, we have never held that because, no matter how narrowly we... we... we treat aggravation, that that excuses the exclusion of mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.509" offset="15044295">That's, I think, the Lockett doctrine which was violated in Mills, Your Honor, and again in this case.</text>
