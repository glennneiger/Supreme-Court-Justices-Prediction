            <text syncTime="276.712" offset="1254311">And if I may elaborate on that just a bit, these are reasons that go twice as deep as the history of the income tax laws themselves, and they are borne out by the church's amicus brief and by the affidavit of Elder Robert Backman, who at the time was the executive director of the missionary work.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.740" offset="1322438">Over its 160-year history the church has found that missionary work has always been family centered, from the very beginning, with one or more members devoting full uncompensated time and effort, usually for a period of two years, while other family members have stayed at home but have participated through their prayers, their letters and most significantly, from the very beginning, their financial support.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.855" offset="1418882">And what the church has found is that the most effective missionary is one whose efforts are an integral part of a total, largely... larger family endeavor, and that that contribution to success from the family involvement is more effectively achieved if the missionary each month receives his check direct from his family rather than from the church itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.133" offset="2740051">But they are analogous only if you accept the premise on which the government builds its entire case, and that premise is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.924" offset="2783206">Although the church receives some indirect benefit from Petitioners' support of their children, the principal beneficiaries of the payments were these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.149" offset="2828136">The government's whole case depends on the correctness of that assumption, that the church's missionary program and the contributions that support it are the missionaries themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.271" offset="2872544">If that assumption is correct, then the tuition earmarking cases are relevant because students are clearly the beneficiaries of the tuition payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.776" offset="2902637">But that assumption bears no resemblance to fact, as the record here shows.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.767" offset="3154562">You are talking, of course, about the Hernandez case, and there the issue was not the, whether it was to or for the use of, it was a question of whether these were gifts or contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.575" offset="3193851">And if there should be any doubt about this, there is no quid pro quo problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.543" offset="3213704">And the reason is, there is a very important reason, the church itself has the ultimate responsibility to see that these missionary expenses are paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.482" offset="3245468">And in the event that some parents cannot or will not pay the missionary expenses, the church picks it up and pays it out of its own, out of its own funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.624" offset="3298027">But to a greater extent than is true of any other endeavor of which I am aware, the life of the Mormon missionary is devoted exclusively to one use, and that use belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.867" offset="3351003">These people are no more beneficiaries of the church's missionary program than a Catholic nun is the beneficiary of the school in which she teaches, or a Red Cross volunteer is the beneficiary of the Red Cross' disaster relief efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.393" offset="3413070">Look at the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.495" offset="3417459">Benjamin Davis averaged over 70 hours a week in proselyting, plus another 10 in study and preparations to proselyte, and his brother Cecil averaged 60 hours a week proselyting, plus 10 to 25 hours in preparation, which included language study, because he, unlike his brother, did his proselyting in a foreign tongue.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.409" offset="3501155">Now, 80 hours a week is hardly incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.794" offset="3518709">They were doing only one thing, and that was proselyting.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.496" offset="3533442">Any other activities were incidental to and in support of their proselyting, and they were doing it on behalf of or for the use of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.953" offset="3575343">And it necessarily follows that donations which do nothing more than sustain those proselyting efforts are also necessarily for the use of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.409" offset="3617139">Harold Davis's affidavit, which is part of the record, states unequivocally that his motive was a sincere religious desire to support the church's missionary program, and that his contributions were subject to a clear understanding and commitment by the sons that the money would be used only in accordance with church guidelines for necessary mission-related expenditures, and was not intended by this... for the sons to use as they might see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.345" offset="3732913">Now, there is no question that there are benefits, but they are religious in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.749" offset="3758513">Insofar as any progress toward any other goal that might relate to the kind of thing that would be motivated by other than religion, it is negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.207" offset="3800309">After those two years, typically it comes right in the middle of a college career, and there is some retooling time and effort that is required once they return.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.506" offset="4821488">There is a great deal of control that the church exercises over these missionaries, and that is much more effective than a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.880" offset="4859000">I come next to the fact that "for the use of" really is, to a large extent, fact bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.604" offset="4913962">And in reaching the final question of which... of whether these are or are not "for the use of", I would invite the Court's attention to two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.079" offset="4959833">First of all, to the extent that there are any of these factual issues that are not adequately developed, we would invite the Court to remand for the development of any further issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.636" offset="5006017">Indeed, I would point out that in the Brinley case, which is the Mormon missionary case in the Fifth Circuit, the circuit did just exactly that with regard to such issues as the Chief Justice, necessarily, the Chief Justice has just been asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.329" offset="5068815">But I would also invite the Court's attention to these four considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.717" offset="5090340">The first is that the church carries out its missionary program exclusively through the efforts of these young men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.204" offset="5116358">There are no others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.823" offset="5122837">Second, it is the church's program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.727" offset="5142376">They are the church's missionaries, and the ultimate financial obligation is on the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.179" offset="5164215">There are thousands of cases throughout the world in which they can't do it the preferred way, and the church always picks up the slack, and they have the ultimate responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.902" offset="5211131">Third, the church, in its own interest, has set guidelines for monthly missionary expenditures in different parts of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.842" offset="5246866">As the Court can determine from consulting those guidelines, they can only be described as frugal in the extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.198" offset="5272257">And they always will be, because the church has determined that above those guideline amounts there is an inverse relationship between the amounts that are spent and the effectiveness of their missionary work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.005" offset="5323562">And finally this, absent religious conviction there is not a person in this court room who would send his son or daughter off for two years to do the kinds of things that Benjamin and Cecil Davis did, in the prime of life and educational opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.983" offset="5395451">The incidental benefits to the children and the parents simply would not be worth the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.019" offset="5411542">Why, then, did Harold and Enid Davis do it, and why were Cecil and Benjamin anxious to go?</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.358" offset="5436933">And the answer is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.891" offset="5443098">It was because of religious conviction that they gave two of their best years, plus the meager amounts to pay their expenses, and they did it that way because the church wanted it done that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.915" offset="5487193">It was for the use of the church.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.114" offset="5887911">This case does not concern the admittedly noble purposes of the Mormon church or its missionary program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.868" offset="5914974">The only issue before the Court today is a question of statutory construction arising under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code, namely, whether payments made by taxpayers directly to their children are deductible as charitable contributions to or for the use of the Mormon church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.098" offset="5999924">We believe the answer to that question is clearly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.585" offset="6017792">Congress has provided a mechanism in the statute for distinguishing between public and private charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.775" offset="6050602">Specifically, Congress has required that the recipient of deductible gifts be a qualified donee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.862" offset="6082993">That is an organization which meets the requirements set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.766" offset="6106608">The only way to ensure that a gift is for the public benefit and that the statute can be reasonably administered and enforced, is to require that all contributions for which deductions are granted under Section 170 be subject to the discretion of a qualified donee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.346" offset="6188842">That is what the statute requires--</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.467" offset="6313393">However, if the contribution were given to the church with the express understanding or limitation that the funds could be used only to support these particular missionaries, the contributions would not be deductible.</text>
