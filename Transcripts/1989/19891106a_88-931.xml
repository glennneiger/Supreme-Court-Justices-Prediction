            <text syncTime="13.324" offset="204952">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.963" offset="219476">The government's claim to recover the severance payments that Boeing made to its employees suffers from several significant flaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.896" offset="251241">The three issues before the Court this morning are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.833" offset="266914">First, Section 209 of Title 18, on which the government relied exclusively as defining the fiduciary duty that the employees allegedly breached, does not apply to pre-employment severance payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.279" offset="332743">Second, the Fourth Circuit overstepped the proper bounds of a reviewing court in disregarding the amply-grounded findings of the trial court that none of these men accepted that severance payment with the kind of intent that Section 209 in other situations may prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.723" offset="414454">And third, under a common law claim to recover the value of any secret payments, adequate disclosure of the type that the trial court found here, bars a claim by an employer for recovery of any conflicting financial arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.311" offset="488851">Let me turn first to the statutory coverage question.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.575" offset="509958">This is an issue on which all... all roads lead to Rome: statutory language, legislative history and legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.947" offset="539424">The language of the statute, as it was revised in 1962, which appears on page 1a of our brief from Mr. Crandon, et al., could not be more clear, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.987" offset="595535">The statute, as it is common ground, defines two correlative offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.860" offset="615074">Certain kinds of compensatory payments that are made by or received by government employees are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.231" offset="648511">Looking first at the statutory application to the payor, in this case Boeing, the statute says, and I will, I think fairly allied the unnecessary language, whoever pays or makes any contribution to or in any way supplements the salary of any such officer or employee, meaning officer or employee of the United States, is guilty of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.690" offset="754359">The one overarching issue with which the government has never come to grips in this case is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.874" offset="783094">Could the government, the day after these payments were made by Boeing to employees still on its payroll, who, as it was stipulated below and found by the trial court, not only were not government employees, but not had... had not been assured government employment or even formally offered government employment, could the government have indicted Boeing for violating Section 209 the day after these payments were made, days or weeks or in several cases months before these men actually became government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.173" offset="916318">I submit the answer to that is clearly no, for the same reason Boeing could not have indicted the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.228" offset="1444514">Where you have statutory language that talks about making a payment to, or a contribution to, or... supplementing the salary of a government officer or employee, I suggest it is at least a strained reading to say that the timing makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.534" offset="1517762">But when you look at what Congress has done in trying to deal with the problem that you identify it becomes clear, and this is why I say that in reading this statutory language, as revised in 1962, the Court ought to consider the other statutes that Congress revised in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.638" offset="1586202">The bribery statute expressly deals with that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.869" offset="1603130">Congress knew how to write that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.087" offset="1611907">It covers payments made not only to incumbent federal officers or employees, but, as the statute defines it, persons "selected to be" public officers or employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.597" offset="1661958">Similarly, Section 203 of Title 18, which was revised at the same time as this statute was revised, punish... punishes certain kinds of compensatory payments made to a person for services to be rendered at a time when he is a government officer or employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.230" offset="1744504">So there are two examples of Congress' knowledge of how to reach pre-government employment payments, if they are made with the kinds of intent that are described in Section 201 and Section 203.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.511" offset="1925690">It did it, however, with an explanation of what limited changes it intended to accomplish in revising the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.819" offset="1954842">We have set these out in our brief because we think it is important to do what the Fourth Circuit apparently didn't do, which is to read Congress' own explanation of whether it was intending to make what I submit would be a fairly substantial change in the coverage that the statute had in its prior form, which was clearly limited by time to incumbent government employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.259" offset="2092664">Section 209 is similar to Title 18 United States Code, Section 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.974" offset="2119518">The latter, that is the predecessor, prohibits a government employee from receiving any salary in connection with its government service from a private source.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.659" offset="2158284">Subsection (a) of Section 209 would reenact this prohibition in substance, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.750" offset="2186601">The House report reads the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.562" offset="2193811">Attorney General Kennedy, whose administration had proposed the bill that ultimately became law, and this is set forth on page 47a, said exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.196" offset="2236442">Comparing the old statute with the new, Subsection (a) prevents an officer or employee of the executive branch from receiving, and anyone from paying him any salary or supplementation from a private source, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.458" offset="2293494">This... provision uses much of the language of former Section 1914 and does not vary from that statute in substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.819" offset="2414911">But that is not the purpose that the statute had in mind when it was... Congress had in mind when it first enacted this statute in 1917, which was to prevent carrying people on the payroll of a private benefactor with the concern being, a concern that doesn't apply when the payment is made before government service, the concern being that the person who is supposedly discharging his duties with an eye solely on the public interest may be looking over his shoulder to see whether or not his judgments will... will affect whether that economic lifeline, as the New York City Bar put it, is going to be cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.851" offset="2567048">That danger is simply not there, the danger of divided loyalty, serving two masters, when an irrevocable, fixed, non-contingent payment is made before government service.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.065" offset="2615845">Now, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, if there is some other understanding, that could constitute a bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.703" offset="2642385">Congress has defined the point where the bribery statute applies, at a certain point before government employment, but not at the... not infinitely back from government employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.558" offset="2685853">So, Congress has decided to deal with a particular problem, divided loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.103" offset="2704034">It rationally chose to draw the line at incumbency.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.632" offset="2722111">Section 1914, it has certainly drawn the line there.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.678" offset="2738307">The explanation for the changes in language in 1962 suggest only... only a narrowing purpose, changing the prior phrase in connection with government employment to a phrase, as compensation for government employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.281" offset="2792746">And if Congress had intended to cover a whole new class of payments, especially in light of the fact that severance payments, pre-employment severance payments, are, as the government has agreed, quite common, one would think that Congress would have said something about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.479" offset="2853559">When one looks at the reasons for dropping the magic phrase on which the Fourth Circuit exclusively focused, one sees that, in the original staff report back in 1958, a House staff report, there was a suggestion that that phrase be taken out, because the staff wanted to cover not only officers of the executive branch, but also members of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.377" offset="4009112">Both the district court and the court of appeals held that the 209 required some proof of subjective intent on the part of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.840" offset="4058953">In fact, the court of appeals expressly found, or expressly rejected, the government's assertion that the statute could be violated with simply a showing of objective intent, or without any intent at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.070" offset="4107855">The construction that the courts below gave that, the statute, we think is compelled, because otherwise the statute would proscribe all manner of payment, including severance payments to which the government does not object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.782" offset="4174728">Having determined that the district court was correct in its holding on the law, the court of appeals nonetheless reversed on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.981" offset="4211509">It reviewed the facts, the objective facts cited by the district court below and drew different inferences, but in doing so it necessarily drew inferences that the district court had in fact rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.694" offset="4266366">This Court has, on many occasions, held that the questions of intent are factual questions for the trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.035" offset="4311714">In fact, where intent itself requires some showing of actual motive or purpose or understanding, this Court's opinion in Pullman-Standard v. Swint held that the legal presumption to be drawn from factual showings less than actual motive was not proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.448" offset="4389350">But that is precisely what the court of appeals has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.041" offset="4403770">It found new facts by making certain limited inferences, but in doing so it did not cite Rule 52(a), it did not discuss or define the proper standard of review, other than to make a passing reference that the court below was clearly erroneous, it did not discuss testimony--</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.617" offset="7046108">We would suggest that it is not sufficient injury for a tort recovery and that really what the court of appeals is saying here is that where there is no proof of a conflict of interest, if there is a bad appearance to the court it is sufficient injury and is sufficient to violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.889" offset="7127192">We think in part that that is a dangerous precedent, because if there is no... if there is insufficient evidence to prove a conflict of interest, it makes little sense to claim that although there is some probability that conflict occurred, but not proven, that we would nonetheless, as an appellate court, find... find an appearance was sufficient to predicate liability and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.645" offset="7222173">In other situations, courts have used conflict of interest also, or appearance of conflict of interest, to describe those situations where there was a clear and irreducible conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.951" offset="7291450">And in those circumstances, as in the Kenealy case cited in all the briefs, I would suggest that an appearance of conflict of interest is either surplusage, in that all actual conflicts would appear to be conflicts, or it's a misnomer in that there is a good deal more than appearance of conflict of interest in, for example, a failed bribe or a self... economic self-dealing situation that are proscribed by statutes 201 and 208.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.628" offset="7402104">In this case we have found no other case where liability was predicated or injury was found based on the appearance of conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.810" offset="7454872">It seems to us where the court of appeals holds that there is in fact no conflict of interest, the appearance is insufficient on which to predicate liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.555" offset="8281804">Both the all-encompassing term whoever and the all-encompassing term any suggests an intent to be all encompassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.772" offset="8302702">And in fact, with respect to the precise issue here, payments received from prior employers, it is significant that the second subsection of Section 209, 209(b), specifically provides for the receipt of certain payments from prior employers, permitting continued participation and severance and other employee benefit plans while the person's in government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.137" offset="8388175">So, just looking at the text of Section 209, it seems to us that there is no exclusion for lump sum payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.835" offset="8442927">And this is consistent with the purposes of Section 209, which is to prevent the divided loyalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.531" offset="8665700">First of all, as we point out at pages 26 to 27 of our brief, the Justice Department had in fact taken the position before the amendment of the statute in 1962 and the provision in the memo quoted in the Roswell Perkins Law Review article, that the... that the statute did apply to severance payments made prior to the entry onto government... government service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.085" offset="8755979">And the reason for that is understandable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.443" offset="8765383">If you look at the... turn your attention, respectfully, to page 2(a) of the appendix to our brief, where the prior statute is reproduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.424" offset="8801327">And the second paragraph... the first paragraph of Section 1914 did contain the phrase, after the word whoever, saying being a government official or employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.310" offset="8840824">The second paragraph, however, had no such limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.246" offset="8856602">It says or in any way supplements the salary of a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.041" offset="8875724">So... and one of the problems with the statute as it read prior to the 1962 amendments was there was an absence of correlation between the first and second paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.600" offset="8913967">And so there was substantial support for the proposition that the... that the statute, particularly the second paragraph, even prior to the passage of 1962, covered such payments, and in fact the report of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, which was one of the two studies that gave rise to the 1962 amendment, specifically noted this ambiguity but said the statute should be clarified to make sure that it covers payments whenever received.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.957" offset="13763443">I think there is a short answer, but it escapes me at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.410" offset="13773265">Can the government, or does the government ever rely on state law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.766" offset="13790715">Suppose there was a law in the state of Washington that protected you in this instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.572" offset="13849856">--I would think that ordinarily we would... we would... because the relationship between prospective employees in the federal government is one of federal law, that we would ordinarily be limited to federal law, although conceivably federal law might borrow a state statute or principle on a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.035" offset="13911714">But here we are not relying on a particular aspect of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.331" offset="13928955">I think it... with respect to the argument on the legislative history, I think it is critical to point out several important defects in what the Petitioners rely on in the legislative history in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.103" offset="14003979">First of all, the phrase being a government official or employee in the first paragraph of Section, then 1914, was specifically dropped from the statute at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.459" offset="14049432">And Congress had two purposes... Congress did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.646" offset="14062180">It both defined that phrase more precisely to be limited to executive employees only, which is the only purpose the Petitioners mentioned, but they also did something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.484" offset="14101572">They deleted it entirely and put the reference to the types of employees further down in the first paragraph, referring only to the time of the performance of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.355" offset="14149011">They did not leave the reference to government officials in there twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.666" offset="14162281">They deleted it the first time it appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.649" offset="14170222">That is, by the way, precisely what Congress did when it modified the former Section 281, now Section &lt;two oh three&gt; [= 203], which bars the receipt of compensation for services performed for someone outside the government while you are a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.175" offset="14228318">Congress also deleted the phrase "being a government official" right at the same place in the statute and moved down further in the statute the specification of the... of the precise categories of employees that are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.716" offset="14282444">And as the legislative history shows, that was done for the specific purpose, and the staff report that we cite in our brief says this, it was done for the specific purpose of making clear that the time of the receipt of the payment did not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.319" offset="14340854">That it was... at the time that the services were performed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.456" offset="14381396">Mr. Lacovara says that the, relies on the phrase 203 and the fact that Section 203 covers members of Congress elect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.842" offset="14422983">The fact is that the predecessor statute had precisely the same coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.169" offset="14436253">It contained the word, and this is important, it contained the phrase "to be rendered", the very phrase he relies on, and it also covered members of Congress, even before they qualified, or after they have qualified for office, even if they haven't taken it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.570" offset="14489856">So it was not the phrase "to be rendered" that covered employees, persons before they became employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.879" offset="14523084">It was the deletion of the same phrase that was deleted here that resulted in the coverage of persons before they enter into government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.720" offset="14554535">And in fact at page 61 of the staff report, which again formed the basis for the statute, the staff report states that this language dealing with government officials or employees was modified to conform its scope to Section 281 as the staff report proposed to revise it, which would have covered all three branches but also would have revised it to apply only when, in that case, when the services are performed, not when the payments are received.</text>
