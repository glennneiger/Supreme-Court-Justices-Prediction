            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87119">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Florida versus Wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.119" offset="107495">In this case, after the respondent was arrested for driving under the influence, an inventory search of his car turned up a locked suitcase in the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.921" offset="146783">The police officials opened the suitcase and discovered a garbage bag containing a large quantity of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.836" offset="174368">The Florida Supreme Court held that the marijuana should have been suppressed because of the complete absence of any police policy concerning the way they dealt with closed containers that they found during an inventory search like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.978" offset="231001">In an opinion filed today, we affirm the ruling of the Florida Supreme Court that the marijuana had to be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.844" offset="262453">We do not agree with the Florida Courtâ€™s conclusion however, that to comport with the Fourth Amendment, a policy of procedure governing inventory searches must require that either all containers or no containers be opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.437" offset="312817">While such policies would be permissible, it would be equally permissible for an inventory search policy to allow police officials to open any containers whose contents they are unable to figure out from looking at the exterior of the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.206" offset="371854">Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment of the Court in which Justice Marshall joins; Justices Blackmun and Stevens have also filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
