            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87122">The opinion of the Court in No. 88-5050, Holland against Illinois will be announced by Justice Scalia.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.733" offset="125992">This case is here on petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois which upheld the petitioner’s conviction of aggravated kidnapping, rape, deviant sexual assault, and armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.041" offset="175207">The preliminary question it presents is whether a white criminal defendant has standing to contest the preemptory challenge of blacks from his jury as a violation of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.896" offset="226616">Our previous cases established that every criminal defendant has standing under the Sixth Amendment to object to the selection of his jury from a venire from the jury pool that is not designed to represent a fair-cross-section of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.173" offset="291713">Although this petitioner seeks to extend the fair-cross-section requirement from the venire to the petit jury itself, that does not affect his standing to press his claim so we hold that he does have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.939" offset="346779">While agreeing with him on the standing point, however, we do not agree with his position on the merits that the Sixth Amendment’s fair-cross-section requirement applies to the petit jury as opposed to the venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.100" offset="395471">The text of the Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants a right not to a representative jury but to an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.852" offset="430475">At the venire stage, the fair-cross-section requirement is necessary to achieve that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.664" offset="453777">Without such a requirement, the state would be able to draw up jury lists so as to produce a pool of perspective jurors disproportionately ill-disposed against one or all classes of defendants stacking the decks, sort of speak, in the state’s favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.310" offset="520337">The fair-cross-section venire requirement thus, assures that in selecting the jury, the prosecution and the defendant will compete on an equal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.482" offset="557013">Extending the fair-cross-section requirement to the petit jury, however, would undermine rather than further the Sixth Amendment’s goal of impartiality because it would cripple the institution of preemptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.343" offset="612392">Preemptory challenges enable each side to exclude those jurors it believes will be most partial to the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.350" offset="644471">Although petitioner’s objection in the present case relates to the striking of blacks, the Sixth Amendment claim, as opposed to a Fourteenth Amendment claim which was not presented here, would be just as strong if he had objected to the exclusion of any number of other identifiable groups, postmen or lawyers or clergymen.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.788" offset="726182">Preventing such generalizations in that preemptory challenge process would obviously destroy an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.524" offset="757215">That institution was part of the traditional understanding of how an impartial jury was composed at the time the Sixth Amendment was adapted, and therefore, any theory of the Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury that would affectively forbid the use of preemptory challenges is implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.965" offset="826910">In this Court, the petitioner raised only a Sixth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.850" offset="842479">Thus, we do not hold that the systematic exclusion of blacks from petit juries to preemptory challenges is lawful under the Equal Protection Clause, it obviously is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.477" offset="888977">Nor do we hold that this white defendant does not have a valid constitutional challenge to such racial exclusion of blacks under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.764" offset="926175">All that we do hold is that he does not have a valid constitutional challenge based on the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.030" offset="951148">The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is therefore affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.442" offset="964836">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan and Blackmun have joined; Justice Stevens has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
