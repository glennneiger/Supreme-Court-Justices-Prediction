            <text syncTime="36.294" offset="293716">The issue before the Court is whether any ascertainable source of judicial power exists to permit the district court, as the district court itself here put it, to offer the mechanisms of judicial process to aid Plaintiffs in filling their class with all its possible members.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.758" offset="375532">Specifically, the district court here facilitated Plaintiff's solicitation effort in several ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.528" offset="858588">Second, no authority for judicial facilitation can be gleaned from either the FLSA or the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.744" offset="895473">And third, the attempt by the Plaintiffs here to rely on the court's inherent power or to engraft a notice provision onto the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and in particular Rule 83, must fail.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="202.245" offset="957540">Mr. Ridley, you don't refer, I think, to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.851" offset="999963">That rule provides that the district court may adopt special procedures for managing potentially difficult actions that may involve multiple parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.578" offset="1046879">Do you think that rule might have some bearing on this matter?</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. Ridley</label>
            <text syncTime="228.742" offset="1063493">Your Honor, there has never been a suggestion as I recall it in the papers below that that rule would govern the situation, and I submit that that would be a rule which would involve the regulation of the action by the district court, as opposed to the facilitation of the joinder of new parties not necessary to the action into the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.787" offset="1143636">The Plaintiffs, in effect, concede here that due process does not mandate notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.301" offset="1173729">And virtually every court which has addressed the issue has held expressly that notice is not required by due process in Section 16(b) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.117" offset="1216988">This is, of course, because non-parties are not bound by the judgment of the court in 16(b) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.393" offset="1246141">Moreover, potential opt-ins in these cases are not necessary parties, and their joinder is not required for the just adjudication of the claims of those who are already parties before the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.064" offset="7392753">The question is couched in the form of whether there is anything in any court rule or statute or otherwise which bars a district court from exercising its power to facilitate notice to potential litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.231" offset="7437475">Why, Respondents have shown that the answer to that question is clearly no, based upon an absence of any conflict, of any statute, rule, legislative history or policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.413" offset="8690203">Roche's principal argument on this appeal is that... their first argument is that Section 216(b), although it provides for a joinder situation or a collective action, is specifically silent on the issue of court-facilitated notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.647" offset="8759166">Of course, that statement is, is true, but silence alone is, as we have seen in many other decisions before this Court, is an unhelpful guide to plumbing congressional intent either way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.202" offset="8885285">There is a second argument that Roche has made that Roche, that than the Congress, when they selected 216(b), somehow intended to adopt the judicial gloss of 1938 or the judicial gloss of 1947 that was surrounding 216(b), and since that judicial gloss was less than clear on the issue of court-facilitated notice, why that would mean that the Congress was making some kind of affirmative direction that the... that the gloss that, whatever it was, should not be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.881" offset="9004090">The case law that pre-existed the ADEA 1967 shows that there was no widespread use of a judicially authorized notice, but there was, nonetheless, some case law support for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.249" offset="9053514">We will concede that the number of cases supporting judicial notice were, were not legion, but the likely explanation for that in 1947 was that the unions, who were the principal disseminators of the notice, didn't need the names and addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.139" offset="9105132">So Congress really had no need to be concerned about whether notice was needed... would be given to people who didn't have the names and addresses already.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.844" offset="12223943">Of course, the concept of court notice existed well before Rule 23, and Rule 23 does not actually confer the power on a court to give notice so much as it merely confirms a court's original inherent power all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.233" offset="12277442">The Advisory Committee was bestirred to put explicit notice provision in the Rule 23 because of due process considerations, which are certainly not present at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.531" offset="12318611">But there is Rule 23(d)(2), which provides for an optional form of court notice when due process concerns are not implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.316" offset="12349749">And to that extent, Rule 23(d)(2)'s power is broad enough to encompass what a court would be doing here today: the power of, of ordering notice for the fair conduct of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.524" offset="12398650">I would also point out that the Advisory Committee note to Rule 23 states that the present provisions of 216(b) are not intended to be affected by Rule 23 as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.322" offset="12441804">And yet if you look at Rule 23 and you argue it somehow to impact on 216(b), you're precisely countermanding, countermanding, the, the directive of the Advisory Committee note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.911" offset="12492169">Because to argue that 216(b) ought to have notice because Rule 23 has notice, why, that is doing the very thing that the Advisory Committee note cautions not to do: not to interpret 216(b) in light of anything that is going on or has gone on with... with Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.781" offset="12555698">Roche's final argument is that the 1947 amendments reflect some general hostility, 1947 amendments to 216(b) reflect some general congressional hostility to all mass joinder actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.218" offset="12605436">Of course, I made the point earlier that to cut out half, but to leave half, is hardly to suggest that they had a hostility to all mass joinder actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.106" offset="12644933">If they had the scalpel, they took care of what they had to take care of, and left what they had to left... had to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.890" offset="12668129">Briefly, I would like to address some general observations about helping the plaintiffs or not helping the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.783" offset="12695610">On one hand, Roche seems to argue that this unduly helps the Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.306" offset="12709716">It, it is our position that this is not an invitation to join, it is not an exhortation, it is not a conscription to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.130" offset="12733018">It is an advisory notice in which the court, for its own reasons, is not acting as an umpire but is acting on its own for its own case management reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.117" offset="12764991">And those are interests which go beyond the needs of the litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.667" offset="12779202">Roche also argues conversely the Plaintiffs don't need the help, and we heard the point earlier discussed that we had successfully gotten 400, why don't we leave the dinner table?</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.514" offset="12818595">We should be filled up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.796" offset="12823715">The answer is you don't know how many people are going to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.389" offset="12846076">The process of informal networking, which is what we would be relegated to, is slow, it is inefficient, it's unreliable, it's incomplete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.975" offset="12876378">Networking can never be effective as court notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.057" offset="12888707">But networking is inevitable, Your Honors, and it is unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.561" offset="12902813">And because it is inevitable and because it is unregulated, those are two reasons in an of themselves why this Court ought to be concerned... ought to be concerned with giving court-facilitated notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.647" offset="12947117">We have heard it said that this is helping strangers to a litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.868" offset="12959969">Well, it is true it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.750" offset="12967493">But to a great extent, the pooling of resources, both monetary and informational, also benefits the litigants, who are desirous of proceeding with as many people in their corner as they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.978" offset="13016394">Now, the point may be made, well, this... isn't this class action run amuck?</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.961" offset="13032381">That may raise a question for congressional resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.003" offset="13048577">But we are talking here about everybody being given a chance to come into this action on the, one the basis of fair notice, on the basis of fair conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.829" offset="13079819">And for us to say at one point, well, you have got enough and we don't want to help any more strangers because the people already before the court have enough help, I don't think the court, at least at this stage of the game, ought to be making those determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.786" offset="13131646">In any event, that is an issue of the appropriateness of class notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.418" offset="13146170">That goes back to the very issue that we started out with: is this a notice question or is this a question of what is judicial discretion here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.614" offset="13178980">If a court says you have already got 400 and you don't need any more, then let the district court say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.398" offset="13202072">But in this particular case the court is not going... we are not addressing the discretion or the propriety of the court's exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.866" offset="13243973">It is a power issue only and, therefore, the questions that were raised about maximizing litigation, stockpiling plaintiffs, seem to have no application to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.713" offset="13283365">As I said before, the precise issue before you is really a limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.866" offset="13299979">It is a power issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.808" offset="13303741">Obviously, the order that is sought by the Plaintiffs in this case will benefit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.709" offset="13327356">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.302" offset="13333729">Indeed class actions under the ADEA may never get off the ground if the... if this court notice procedure is not followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.069" offset="13364763">In our case we had 400, but in the next case there may be only a plaintiff who is not well connected and who is not well heeled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.443" offset="13390258">And what is he supposed to do if he can't find the friends and, and conduct the grapevine activities that he needs to, to, to build a case with some degree of force against an employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.762" offset="13431532">Roche has essentially skirted the basic issue of power, and they have argued what should be done, not what can be done.</text>
