            <label>Mr. Dennis A. Fischer</label>
            <text syncTime="40.628" offset="302805">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.439" offset="318060">This case involves two issues of constitutional dimension concerning two aspects of California's 1978 death penalty initiative, which have since been corrected in measures adopted by the committee that controls the giving of instructions in state trial courts throughout California in 1983 and 1985, respectively, following decisions by the California Supreme Court disapproving of those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.150" offset="436865">Petitioner Richard Boyde was found guilty by a Riverside Superior Court jury of murder with two special circumstance allegations being found true.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.417" offset="485975">Because the prosecutor had announced his intention to seek the death penalty before trial commenced and the jury was examined and death qualified, the trial proceeded into a penalty phase that, before the same jurors, that was directed and governed by the statutory provisions at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.751" offset="571239">The prosecutor presented evidence in aggravation that covered and tracked factors A, B and C of the eleven factors listed in Penal Code Section 190.3, and set forth in the jury instruction that is before the Court in this case, concerning both the crime itself, prior felony convictions on the part of the Defendant, and past activity of a... criminal activity of a forcible or violent nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.634" offset="706762">Some of the evidence that he presented, the California Supreme Court subsequently determined had been improperly presented, because it did not relate to the statutory aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.182" offset="753051">The defense then began its case, and presented testimony from Richard Boyde's mother, from two of his sisters, his stepfather, his wife, Brenda Dickson Green, his former girlfriend and mother of his child, and Mrs. Dickson, Mrs. Green's mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.026" offset="836330">Together, they presented a wide variety of evidence about the character and background of Richard Boyde that was not immediately related to the circumstances of the underlying crime, but did provide a basis for the jury, in Justice Powell's words in McCleskey versus Kemp, to decline to impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.119" offset="920757">Petitioner's evidence, in fact, was remarkable in its comparison and similarity to cases previously before this Court, beginning with Lockett and Evans, and Eddings, and that, and the... in showing that this defendant did not deserve to be sentenced to death, a point, indeed, that has not been questioned in Respondent's submission to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.676" offset="1022948">That evidence consisted of the following aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.067" offset="1040503">First, his impoverished childhood and difficult upbringing, including the fact that he had been fatherless and was obsessed with that fact, and obsessed with his father's abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.245" offset="1081254">This is evidence very close to that recognized in Hitchcock versus Dugger, as being appropriate evidence to bring before the jury on the question of whether the defendant deserved the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.395" offset="1125871">His considerable health problems as a child, and his psychological difficulties that affected his performance at school, and which the family attempted unsuccessfully to obtain counseling assistance for, but was unable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.483" offset="1182191">Besides Hitchcock, this factor is recognized in Mills versus Maryland's footnote 1, and is similar to other cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.308" offset="1217508">Third, his fondness and affection toward children, his kindness to family members.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.393" offset="1241854">Justice O'Connor has spoken, in Franklin versus Lynaugh, in a concurrence in observing that evidence of kindness to others might demonstrate positive character traits that might mitigate against the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.713" offset="1287099">Fourth, his sisters' testimony that he liked dancing, that he wanted to pursue it as a career, but that his stepfather, being a stern gentleman, trying to do his best, but frowned on it and discouraged young Richard from pursuing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.232" offset="1349165">And that testimony was followed by Mrs. Green's testimony that when Richard was incarcerated that he won a prize for his dance choreography while he was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.419" offset="1397962">As in Skipper versus South Carolina, this certainly is a showing that the defendant could lead a useful life, at least behind bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.617" offset="1438713">And finally, his futile attempts to find employment after his release, attempts that he conducted in earnest, but was unsuccessful because of his record.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.805" offset="1491481">Although these factors are basic to the concern of individualized sentencing, which this Court explicated in Woodings versus North Carolina, many subsequent cases, Petitioner's jury could not give effect to them, because this evidence was nowhere on the list of eleven factors set forth in Penal Code Section 190.3, and guided by the jury instructions which the jury was directed to consider and give effect to as the basis for its determination of whether the defendant should receive death or life imprisonment without parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.594" offset="1766602">Beginning with the language of the statute itself, which has eleven factors, all but two of which are crime specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.510" offset="1802338">So the jury, at the same time that it was listening to the, as an aggravating factor B, the prior felony convictions or the C, the prior criminal activity, very clearly prior or other activity, was then being told in all the remaining factors, except, even including age, by the way, at the time of the crime, at the time of commission of the offense, at the time of the homicidal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.758" offset="1911321">A jury, given this language, at least explicitly, would, might well conclude, and certainly its members, just from the language alone, without anything further, that it, that related to the crime meant extenuating the gravity of the crime, and not extenuating the reasons why the defendant should not die.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.444" offset="1994076">And in fact you will notice that the CALJIC committee, the California judges and distinguished attorneys who create the instructions and followed this up, as we have set forth in the appendix and also appears in our amicus brief, use language very different to portray... in effect saying any other reason that would favorably bear on the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.149" offset="2420917">In discussing the question of the factor (k)'s effect on the jury, I have already mentioned the specific language of limitation of the factor and its context in comparison with others on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.793" offset="2507435">Justice Rehnquist has raised the question, however, of whether the jury might have been expected to understand that, notwithstanding those factors, that circumstances extenuating the gravity of the crime might also reach beyond the crime to character and background.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.954" offset="2580055">And my answer is most tellingly, I think, taken from the prosecutor's argument on those issues, on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.250" offset="2617254">The district attorney started out in his opening argument to the jury with a list on the board, and it must have been a very graphic.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.047" offset="2656437">He went up to the list, he had the factors numbered, he pointed them out to the jury, he had the jury read the list on the board, and then, from that, he went down them one by one, individually reading them and counting up whether they were aggravating or mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.278" offset="2729371">He ended up by, in his summation of, in his beginning argument, by saying ten solid factors in aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.777" offset="2763330">Then he went through the Petitioner's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.047" offset="2776496">He used words to characterize it as a rationalization, as speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.382" offset="2797812">He asked rhetorically whether any of them made the crime less serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.085" offset="2816620">He then jumped to the next aspect of the instruction, which told the jury that in making their determination they have taken an oath to follow the law, and asked them to go through each and every one of those factors and be guided by them in making that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.769" offset="2895301">After the defense completed the opening argument, the prosecutor returned to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.604" offset="2922677">Among the things that he talked about was that, and he used the term sympathy was to be filtered out under the instructions and is not a basis for anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.334" offset="2969593">He then defined sympathy as being underpowered, not knowing who his father was, having a poor childhood, some of the very factors that we have talked about as, that this Court has recognized as mitigating factors of character and background that come, are derived from the Lockett line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.358" offset="3045662">He also stated that rehabilitation is not one of the factors up on that board, and is not a basis to make a decision like this, in seeming contradiction to Skipper, and the suggestion that one's usefulness in prison is a factor for the jury to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.308" offset="3109505">Then he said well, there is always the concern of losing someone of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.363" offset="3129672">Well, I don't put much stock in that argument, he said, again, it is not on the list... all of this, pages 4819, 4820, 4821 of the record... in which he made these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.002" offset="3180245">You can't base it upon any kind of rational guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.805" offset="3195500">The deterrent value of the death penalty, he added, is not the basis for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.128" offset="3216816">So, the prosecutor's own language suggested to the jury that if there was any question in their mind, that they were precluded from giving effect to this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.366" offset="3265717">Now, practitioners in California, during that time and during the time before the Easley case, clarified that this procedure should be abandoned, that this language was too narrow, were well aware of this language, and used it in their own practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.420" offset="3341995">Indeed, prosecutors, defense counsel, and even trial judges made statements of this very kind in records that are available to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.027" offset="3380343">And we have, with the assistance of amicus curiae California appellate project, some actual examples of record, a significant number of them, in which this very, this very thing played out.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.106" offset="3432692">Consider just as one example, on page 13 of the CAP amicus brief, the reference to the case of People versus Payton, where the prosecutor argued the defendant's newborn Christianity, urged that there is no way that, under any other circumstance which extenuates or lessens the gravity of the crime, that what I am getting at you have not heard during the past few days any legal evidence of mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.135" offset="3548780">I passed over the language I wanted too quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.788" offset="3563409">Let me repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.329" offset="3565603">Seems to refer to a fact in operation at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.884" offset="3587859">It is language like that which, and obviously the jury returned a death verdict in the Payton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.249" offset="3621296">And in the following pages of the CAP amicus, which graphically, in real world terms, demonstrates what, in a particular case, we just know from a very skilled argument of a single state prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.888" offset="3675840">In some... the mitigating evidence that was presented in this case could not be considered and given effect to by the jury as a basis for sentence less than death.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.107" offset="3728712">Mr. Fischer, let me ask you, I agree that that, that example is quite clearly an argument that it simply can't be used under the gravity factor, quite simply and plainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.029" offset="3800392">But that is not this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.570" offset="3902583">Well, I think that the constitutional test... and when I say that we want it out, in agreeing with you, I really would quality that by saying that we are comfortable, certainly, representing this Petitioner, and comfortable with the notion that the CALJIC modification in the instruction which is given throughout the state, very satisfactorily resolves that particular dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.116" offset="4000699">So that we don't need to do any more than say that the practice will, or in all cases after Easley indeed, will have not been subject to constitutional problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="978.627" offset="4054824">And in those cases, it seems to me that if we can ascertain from empirical data like this that a reasonable juror would have been mislead into believing that he or she was precluded from giving weight, mitigating effect, to this language--</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.747" offset="4231307">If you look at what the prosecutor said and did, he did nothing more than, for example on page 14, the immediately, case immediately following Payton, Guzman, the reference to the fellow's ability to paint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.924" offset="5335974">It was constitutionally imperative that that defendant be allowed to have the jury's determination of appropriateness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.317" offset="7381570">I think it's important, and the test that this Court has applied in California versus Brown is what reasonable jurors would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.781" offset="7411350">With respect to factor (k) it is our position that reasonable jurors would understand that the words any other circumstances which extenuate mean just that, any other circumstances which extenuate, or mitigate, or lessen the penalty, the culpability of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.913" offset="7483970">And I think, referring to Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in California versus Brown, I think it is interesting that she noted there that the reason why we allow jurors to consider such things as deprived childhoods and things like that is because of society's collective belief that these things mitigate culpability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.725" offset="9347128">What he did, simply, was to tell the jury that they were not going to be having totally arbitrary and free reign in deciding the penalty, that they were going to have standards which were going to guide the exercise of their discretion, that it was important that they proceed to come to a rational conclusion, that it was not a matter of on Monday you can reach one result in the case and on Tuesday that you can reach a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.567" offset="9470530">He specifically told the jury that we used to have a system like that, where the jury had unbridled discretion to do whatever it wanted, but that the courts had said we needed more rationality in the process, and that they would be required to apply some standards, some criteria, to guide a rational determination of the appropriate penalty in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.467" offset="10266116">In fact, his argument with respect to factor (k) was rather that he had a different view of what the defendant was like than the defense counsel was arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.355" offset="10313659">His view was that we have here a man who lies, who deceives, who would make up a fictitious big Mike, who would even blame his cousin for the commission of this terrible crime, who was a violent individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.805" offset="10367471">He said that is the kind of person we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.386" offset="10377815">And then he turned to the evidence in mitigation, and he said that that evidence simply did not mitigate against the gravity of the crime, all of the other factors, which the jury was entitled to consider under the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.141" offset="10456810">And he said, I suppose we are all a product of our backgrounds to some degree or another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2599.666" offset="10538939">He suggested first that it counted not at all, and then he suggested later in, I believe it was his rebuttal argument, that even if the jury disagreed with him and was inclined to give it some weight, they still needed to ask themselves the ultimate question, which was does it outweigh the other circumstances, which he argued were all in aggravation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.774" offset="11695327">When you break it down into two-steps, and you tell the jury may, you really don't know what is happening.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis A. Fischer</label>
            <text syncTime="3110.995" offset="12584222">Very quickly, the Respondent points to the 250 pages of transcript that it took to elicit the evidence, and tries to make some point about it must have had some effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.597" offset="12658619">In fact, in Hitchcock versus Dugger, we know that considerable evidence was elicited, but that the jury was precluded from giving effect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.583" offset="12694563">Counsel several times has stated the language of factor (k) in somewhat different language here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.521" offset="12726328">He invariably uses the words any other circumstance which extenuates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.366" offset="12745763">But at least once or twice I heard him say a word other than the gravity of the crime, because I think he is using the word culpability, or penalty, without the gravity of the crime, as the catchword.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.056" offset="12792470">If indeed that is his concept of what it means, then surely there is no problem, under Lockett and Eddings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.270" offset="12825384">But our position is that the language that the jury heard, the language which the prosecutor talked about and stressed over and over again, both in context and specifically, is the language that this jury had before it, was advised by the final instructions to give effect to and be guided by, and to make its determination based on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.044" offset="12908454">The... I may have misstated or conceded something a bit too quickly in answering Justice White's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.622" offset="12942726">A quick review of the opening words of the dissenting opinion by Justice Arguelles in this case indicates that his total outright concurrence was only as to the guilt and special circumstance phases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.899" offset="13051918">And my reading, in fact triggered by something that Justice Blackmun suggested in referring to the voir dire problem, suggests that indeed that the supreme court's difficulty with the voir dire extended to the meaning of the final special circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.990" offset="13120254">Mr. Millar indicated that he believes that the jury well understood its responsibility in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.576" offset="13158602">We can only look back at the district attorney's own voir dire questions and explanations of his understanding of the factor and the meanings of the word shall, and how that weighing process operated, to know that his state of mind, in understanding of both the scope of factor (k) and the shall instruction, was very different than he would now have us accept as the jury's.</text>
