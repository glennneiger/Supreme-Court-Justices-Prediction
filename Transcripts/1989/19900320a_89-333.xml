            <text syncTime="11.139" offset="189039">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.391" offset="198025">The question presented in this case is whether state water laws apply to hydropower projects that are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, as it is commonly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.031" offset="240552">The case involves a dispute between California and FERC over minimum flows for the Rock Creek project out in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.535" offset="270645">California has established higher flow requirements for the project than those imposed by FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.606" offset="294887">FERC makes the argument in this case that the Federal Power Act completely preempts state flow requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.327" offset="313799">California argues that Section 27 of the Federal Power Act authorizes the state to set its own flow requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.497" offset="342430">California's position in this case, I might add, is supported literally by all 49 sister states.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.901" offset="364059">Section 27 provides on its face that the Federal Power Act does not interfere with state laws relating to control, appropriation, use or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses, or any vested right acquired therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.410" offset="426126">California's flow requirements in this case relate to control, appropriation and use of water for other uses, mainly in-stream uses and also hydropower uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.302" offset="469698">Indeed, under California law, in-stream fish flows are specifically defined as a beneficial use of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.974" offset="500418">And therefore, Section 27 literally encompasses the California flow requirements in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.128" offset="524973">The legislative history we believe makes especially clear that Congress intended to defer to the states preeminent water rights authority and to preserve the state's existing traditional water right laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.250" offset="569486">Congress indeed has traditionally deferred the state's water laws, and in passing the Federal Power Act, and particular Section 27, Congress intended to continue the same tradition of deference that has been followed in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.625" offset="614939">And that legislative history indicates that Congress specifically intended for hydropower projects to comply with state water laws to the same extent that other persons must comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.183" offset="657257">Congressman Doremus stated during their legislative debates,</text>
            <text syncTime="131.551" offset="670632">"Water power companies organized under this act will be obliged to be obliged to operate under state law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="137.622" offset="694978">Congressman Mondell stated that the bill disclaims any intent to take over control of water from the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.193" offset="721205">No congressman during the legislative debates offered any different interpretation of Section 27 or suggested that the hydropower projects are not required to comply with state water laws.</text>

I think that I need to get across to the Court is that the legislative history of Section 27 of the Federal Power Act indicates that the provision was expressly modeled after Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.306" offset="3461659">The primary author of Section 27 said he copied Section 27 from Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.044" offset="3488617">And in California v. United States this Court held that Section 8 requires the Secretary of the Interior to comply with state water laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.630" offset="3514949">In that case, the Solicitor General made the same argument on Section 8 that he makes today on Section 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.517" offset="3534593">He argued that Section 8 is limited simply to proprietary rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.569" offset="3550789">And this Court rejected the argument saying that that argument would trivialize... and that was the Court's word... trivialize... the broad language in policy of Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.409" offset="3586106">And since Section 27... or that is to say, since Section 8 requires the Secretary of the Interior to comply with state water laws, and since Section 27 is directly modeled after Section 8, it would follow that Section 27 requires hydropower projects to comply with state laws as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.371" offset="3649950">In other words, the intent of Congress was that by putting Section 8 into the Federal Power Act hydropower projects would be required to comply with state law to the same extent that Federal reclamation projects are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.178" offset="3697179">And if the result were otherwise, you would have an anomaly and indeed an inconsistency on water rights throughout the West.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.573" offset="4082746">And this Court said, no, Section 9(b) is simply an informational provision only; it is not a subsidy provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.969" offset="4164353">Now, that holding could be correct, and indeed we do not challenge it here, and the Court could still sustain California's position here, because in First Iowa the Court did not consider... or I should say anything that it did consider concerning the effect of Section 27 was extraneous to the decision and, therefore, in our view was dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.031" offset="4236555">Now certainly the Court had a very crabbed view of Section 27 in the First Iowa case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.419" offset="4258185">But as I have said, that crabbed view is inconsistent with the broad view that this Court took of Section 8 in the case of California v. United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.354" offset="7041897">In the Federal Power Act Congress has delegated to the Commission responsibility for licensing those hydroelectric projects that in the Commission's judgment are best adapted to the development of the waterways in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.280" offset="7097590">In each such licensing, the Commission weighs a variety of interests, including the requirements of interstate and foreign commerce, irrigation, navigation, the environment and many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.040" offset="7156627">The question presented by this case is when the Commission has undertaken that task, balanced those interests and issued a license, Section 27 reserves to the states authority to prevent the judgment from being put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.383" offset="7213992">Now, our fundamental contention is that this Court has reached and resolved that question in, among other cases, the First Iowa case and Federal Power Commission v. Oregon, the Pelton Dam case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.357" offset="7269894">In both those cases, state laws were asserted that would have blocked hydroelectric projects that had been licensed by FERC, or in the... excuse me, in the First Iowa case the Commission had expressed approval of the project though it had not actually issue the license and this Court held that those state laws could not be applied to veto the implementation of the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.996" offset="8012503">--Your Honor, I think it's hypothetical that would not arise because the way the process works is to channel state concerns through the licensing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.102" offset="8044895">Were the Commission to establish a minimum flow requirement and to state along with it that it wasn't prescriptive in any sense, I suppose there would be room for the states to do different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.290" offset="8089617">But that is not the Commission's practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.075" offset="8096826">Let me make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.741" offset="8099439">The Commission's minimum flow requirements express its judgments about the appropriate balance between the use of water for hydropower purposes and the protection of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.882" offset="8148026">It does not, to my knowledge, set minimum flow requirements without meaning them to be prescriptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.053" offset="8180732">Because our position begins with the First Iowa case, I think it's important to lay to rest the suggestion that the analysis there about the scope of Section 27 and the preemptive effect of the Federal Power Act was dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.247" offset="8241440">In that case, it's important to recognize the Court accepted that it would be impossible for the state to comply with the licensing requirement that was in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.138" offset="8288983">That requirement provided that the water for a stream would have to be returned at the nearest practical place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.292" offset="8317613">And the essence of the project was to divert the flow of the Cedar River through a canal to the Mississippi, effectively dewatering the last 29 miles of the stream, so that there was no suggestion that there was a possibility that the project could be licensed and compliance with the state law could be worked out later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.705" offset="8395249">The Court understood the case in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.739" offset="8403399">The questions presented included the question whether the issue had been superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.623" offset="8422939">The applicant for the license had not tried to get a state permit and, therefore, argued... at every stage of the proceeding it relied on the argument that the requirement for compliance was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.848" offset="8471840">And the... the Court's reasoning in that case, I believe, leaves no doubt that the Court reached and decided the question whether the state licensing requirement was enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.840" offset="8523876">And in reaching that conclusion and reaching the conclusion, in the Court's words, that the question whether the project should go forward was one for the Commission and not for the authorities of the state, the Court necessarily considered and resolved three propositions I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.534" offset="8598586">First, it analyzed the structure of the Act as a whole and reached the conclusion that the entire scheme was designed to place in the Commission responsibility for resolving the issue presented by the licensing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.329" offset="8661803">Second, it found that Section 9(b) did not save state laws, did not... despite the inference that could be drawn from the remainder of the statute, Section did... B did not preserve the enforceability of... of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.423" offset="8726168">And finally, it reached and addressed the argument presented by the State of... Iowa in that case that Section 27 independently saved the state law, and it discussed the scope of Section 27, both in response to Iowa's assertion and because it was necessary to the judgment in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.038" offset="8812582">Aware that Section 27 was there, the Court couldn't very well find the state statute preempted without considering whether Section 27 saved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.827" offset="8851765">Now, any... any doubt on that score, we submit, was laid to rest in the Pelton Dam case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.545" offset="8874648">In that case, one of the requirements that the applicant for a license had not complied with was a state statute that required a license to appropriate water for the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.371" offset="8929924">And the Ninth Circuit had held in that case that the FERC could issue only a permissive license, not a license that would confer a complete right to build the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.262" offset="8973496">And this Court rejected the argument that compliance was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.583" offset="8994812">And I'd like to refer the Court to a portion of the opinion not cited in our brief, which was footnote 24 of... at 349 U.S. at 450 to 451.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.808" offset="9051654">The state statute with which there had been no compliance... the permit requirement is quoted there, and the Court noted that under its decision compliance was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.150" offset="9109124">So, I think there's no doubt at this stage that First Iowa set out the analysis that's appropriate for determining whether state laws have been superseded in the Court's words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.660" offset="9167115">Now, Justice O'Connor inquired about the status quo on the ground in light of First Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.481" offset="9190417">We have a different view than California on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.551" offset="9210688">We've cited a number of decisions in our brief in which courts have consistently applied First Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.205" offset="9245274">I'm referring to page 24 at footnote 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.525" offset="9262619">To our knowledge, there has been no case in the lower courts in which a court has taken the position that First Iowa is anything less than good law as it purports to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.759" offset="9687475">In that situation, FERC is authorized to license the hydroelectric development of the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.986" offset="11088369">In the Fresno case the Court noted that the savings clause would not save state law, which granted a priority to municipal uses of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.072" offset="11316784">We submit that that affirmative grant of authority would qualify as a express congressional directive, a clear congressional directive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.284" offset="11389613">It couldn't personally supervise the hundreds of hydropower projects in various situations that would be necessary across the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.575" offset="11546766">Our first position is that First Iowa should be enforced according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.478" offset="11566410">But our second position is that the express delegation of authority to the Commission is the kind of clear congressional directive, when exercised, that is exempted from the savings clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.642" offset="11651047">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.678" offset="11659197">And let me emphasize three things about the delegation that we believe underscore the importance of respecting Congress' choice of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.784" offset="11699635">First of all, it's an affirmative delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.002" offset="11712487">Congress in this case has not given the Commission the job of certifying compliance with certain minimum standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.007" offset="11748536">Its job under Section 10(a) of the Act is to determine whether the project is best adapted to a variety of interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.113" offset="11780928">And that's a... a... it's supposed to make an affirmative judgment, and we think that that phrasing suggests that it must have meant that when the Commission determined what was best, that would be put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.921" offset="11832128">Secondly, the matters committed to the Commission's judgment are comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.425" offset="11858146">In the words of this Court in the Udall case, it's supposed to consider all interests relevant to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.197" offset="11889284">The strong suggestion is that there is... that what... when it's done that properly, disputes with state authority will take the form of differing judgments about matters that have been committed to the Commission's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.690" offset="11947275">And we believe that, again, there's another... that's another very strong indication that Congress must have meant its judgments to be implemented... the Commission's judgments to be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.379" offset="11986041">Finally, the Commission's judgment encompasses matters of national and regional scope, matters that may not be fully reflected in state law, in particular interstate and foreign commerce and navigability and, in the background, the nation's need for renewable resources of energy as opposed to coal and oil-fired plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.613" offset="12094919">Again, those three characteristics of the delegation to the Commission... its affirmative nature, its comprehensive nature and its national nature... are very strong indication that Congress meant for what the Commission judged to be best would be put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.729" offset="12183422">And in considering that I think that it's important as well to remember that while this particular project involves a relatively small stream in California, that the Act as a whole applies nationwide to projects of a much greater scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.075" offset="12276732">We've cited in our brief the Allegheny Power case, in which the Commission considered an application... considered applications for 19 licenses in the upper Ohio River basin simultaneously and granted 16 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.620" offset="12338903">Those... those projects were in two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.572" offset="12354786">The Ohio River is obviously a state that is... it crosses state boundaries and in which--</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.544" offset="12394701">The Ohio River crosses several state lines and presents serious interstate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.969" offset="12432317">So, I... I... when... when construing the statute, trying to determine the relationship within the overall scheme of the Commission's licensing authority and Section 27, it's important to recognize that the accommodation will apply across the board, not just to relatively small projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.440" offset="12562198">The suggestion that it is available to the Court to disavow the dictum in First Iowa I think understates the nature of the change in law that would be necessary to adopt California's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.033" offset="12624578">As I've indicated, I believe that the Federal Power Commission v. Oregon case cannot stand along with a decision that every Federal hydropower project is required to obtain a Federal license on the terms that a state may choose to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.529" offset="12706603">That was a case in which an applicant failed to get a state license and the Court nevertheless held that the project could go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.125" offset="12793016">Finally, I'd like to follow through on the point that Justice O'Connor raised about the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.747" offset="12835439">I think there is a... there would be a significant... that a decision in effect overruling First Iowa subordinating Federal hydropower projects to all state water law would have a significant impact in three significant respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.225" offset="12913388">First, in 1986 Congress passed a statute, the Environmental Consumer... I mean Electrical Consumers Protection Act, which reinforced the Commission's responsibility to consider and address environmental issues in its licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.936" offset="12988203">Under that statute, the Congress created procedures whereby concerns about the environment would be funneled through the licensing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.578" offset="13026759">The Commission is required to solicit recommendations from state and Federal agencies with wildlife concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.465" offset="13058315">It's also required to consider state plans for comprehensive development in its licensing decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.738" offset="13091439">The very clear implication of that legislation is that the Commission was to have the final say, with the benefit of the views of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.343" offset="13129891">A decision that the states could implement their own policy choices through state water law would seriously undercut that scheme, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.901" offset="13172105">Secondly, there's nothing in California's argument that would limit its interpretation to those state water laws that apply at the threshold of a hydroelectric project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.459" offset="13222260">There are a number of projects in operation right now that have been licensed, we believe, on the assumption that First Iowa was good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.963" offset="13256324">California, among other states, have begun to revise state water law to permit changes in water appropriations after an initial license or permission to use water has been granted under the public trust doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.109" offset="13332915">We believe that there would be considerable uncertainty engendered if California's view were adopted and that body of state law were potentially applicable to licensed existing projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.934" offset="13384219">Finally, projects are relicensed on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.652" offset="13403132">Licenses are issued for terms of up to 50 years but a number of major projects come up for renewal on a regular basis, and we believe that the result for which California argues in this case could have a serious unsettling effect on those procedures as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.799" offset="13479618">Unless the Court has any further questions, thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3341.536" offset="13510652">Some comments, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.921" offset="13520160">I understood the Solicitor General to say that the FERC licenses... the hydropower components of Federal projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.158" offset="13549104">And if that's what he said, that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.360" offset="13557881">Indeed, FERC has no jurisdiction over the hydropower component of Federal projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.395" offset="13578048">But on the other hand, under this Court's decision in California v. United States, the states do have jurisdiction over hydropower components of the Federal projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.850" offset="13611902">Thus the FERC argument in this case means in effect that the state can regulate the hydropower component of Federal projects, but not of private projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.392" offset="13654012">And this doesn't make any sense to us at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.325" offset="13661744">As a matter of fact the Federal project has much deeper Federal interest connected with it then the private project, where the Federal projects that state law is applied to under California v. United States are authorized by Congress, built and operated by Federal agencies, funded by the American taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.985" offset="13724438">The hydropower projects here, on the other hand, are built, financed and operated by private entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.988" offset="13744395">And therefore, the Federal interest is much more involved with respect to Federal project than the private one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.042" offset="13764666">I'd like to briefly go over the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy had in mind in his question to the Solicitor General.</text>
