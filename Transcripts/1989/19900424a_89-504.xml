            <text syncTime="14.074" offset="202114">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.962" offset="217682">This case raises an important question of the appealability of the district court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.531" offset="244014">It is a question of importance not only in the administration of the Social Security Act, but over a wide range of administrative, rule making and adjudicatory activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.506" offset="291870">Although this Court has never addressed this question in an administrative setting before, the question has been considered in that setting for some four decades by every court of appeals, and the vast majority of the court of appeals' decisions support appealability in the context that it is presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.156" offset="394479">In addition, in very analogous situations this Court has addressed the question of appealability in the exercise of its own jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.279" offset="438992">And in those contexts, appealability has been upheld explicitly in the review of state court decisions under Section 1257 and implicitly in the review of court of appeals' decisions under the Hobbs Administrative Review Act, Section 2350, as in the famous Vermont Yankee decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="116.791" offset="612967">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.675" offset="616520">The respondent argues in answer to our argument that the court under the Hobbs Administrative Review Act not only has jurisdiction to review final judgments under 2350 but also has general jurisdiction under 1254.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.687" offset="688618">We believe that's clearly not so from the structure and language of 2350.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.841" offset="709202">2350 indeed specifically adds to this Court's jurisdiction the ability to review a certified question under 1254.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.881" offset="749327">We do not believe that 2350 contemplates a general authority to this Court to review a judgment of a court of appeals before or after judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.820" offset="793108">What it does is it puts this Court in a relationship to the court of appeals, which is the entry court of the Federal system in a situation that is very analogous to the ordinary relationship between a court of appeals and a district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.664" offset="852458">Indeed, for this Court to grant certiorari before judgment we believe would be an exercise of original jurisdiction in violation of Article 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.089" offset="902195">This particular case that arises before this Court involves a claim for survivor's disability benefits by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.897" offset="957470">When that claim was finally denied at the administrative level, the respondent sought judiciary review in a Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.705" offset="1000625">The Federal district court held that the Secretary has made an error of law in relying solely on the listing of the impairments in the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.529" offset="1051929">The district court then decided that since there had been no individualized determination of Respondent's residual functional capacity to do gainful work, the matter had to go back to the administrative agency for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.439" offset="1111593">At that point, the Secretary sought review in the court of appeals, and the court of appeals dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.862" offset="1145343">After rehearing en banc had been denied by the court of appeals over three dissents, the case was brought here for a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.651" offset="1180451">The sole question before this Court on certiorari is the appealability of the district court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.023" offset="1217963">We submit, in accordance with those courts... on the majority of those courts that have reviewed on the problem below, that this decision is appealable, and we believe its appealability may be upheld on either of two alternative grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="949.252" offset="3942848">Indeed, in Sullivan and Hudson the Court specifically said that its holding with respect to the definition of a civil action and with respect to the definition of finality was addressed to EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.661" offset="4000527">And, indeed, EAJA contains its own definition of final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.232" offset="4018812">EAJA says a final judgment is a judgment that is not subject to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.386" offset="4047442">The concept of finality under EAJA is intimately tied to the concept of who is a prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.075" offset="4078162">And this Court that has held that for EAJA purposes a claimant is not a prevailing party until her claim has been fully resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.373" offset="4375331">But, Your Honor, it really is not critical to our position, because, in the first place, we are not seeking to appeal the remand order as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.562" offset="4412112">And, in the second place, in response to Justice O'Connor's question even a sixth sentence remand, in our view, is not appealable by the Secretary if the remand results in a judgment for the claimant, because the seventh sentence of 405(g) specifically limits review to the review that could be given to an original determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.313" offset="4523080">And as I indicated earlier, the Secretary has no authority to appeal an original determination in favor of a claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.919" offset="4557562">So, even if this... even if this case involves a sixth sentence remand, we don't believe that affects the ultimate outcome on the issue of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.108" offset="4594238">And, as we explained in our reply brief and in our original brief, we don't think it's a sixth sentence remand in any event because it is not a remand either at the instance of the Secretary or because there is new material evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.527" offset="5435903">That is, to take a case, for example, like ASARCO, which was decided last term, or like Mercantile Bank against Lagdo, which was decided some years ago, these cases involved review of state court decisions in which a state court had finally adjudicated some Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.191" offset="5514584">And then the state supreme court had remanded it to the lower courts for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.995" offset="5533810">It was possible, of course, that when the case came back to the state supreme court, it might reconsider the Federal question it had passed on before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.600" offset="5576233">But the state supreme court, as far as it was concerned, had disposed of that Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.140" offset="5602355">And so this Court in these cases... Lagdo and these other cases... held that for purposes of the final judgment requirement of 1257 the underlying purposes of finality had been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.014" offset="5653869">Our argument here is comparable to that and, indeed, it seems to us that the Cohen doctrine is a recognition of the applicability of that line of reasoning in the context of court of appeals review of district court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.976" offset="5721787">The particular requirements of the Cohen doctrine we believe are all met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.046" offset="5746029">Indeed, we don't think there can be much argument about some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.431" offset="5759612">For example, we think it's clear that the district court was not in its own mind making a tentative decision about the error of law that the Secretary had committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.073" offset="5810185">The decision was, in the judge's mind, a conclusive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.227" offset="5830770">With respect to the second Cohen criterion, Respondent vigorously contests our argument that it does apply... the criterion that the decision in whose review is sought be separable from the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.552" offset="5892105">We think it is undoubtedly true, indeed, as it was true, I think, in some other context like Mitchell and Forsythe... we think it is undoubtedly true that the error of law that we believe the district court made is an error that goes to the merits of the respondent's claim for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.031" offset="5965980">But the rationale of that separability requirement we believe is fully met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.787" offset="5993042">As we understand the Court's discussion of that requirement, it is designed to prevent courts of appeals from interfering unduly with the ongoing process of trying the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.928" offset="6045601">The trial court judge has a special role to fulfill, and premature consideration would interfere with that role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.783" offset="6076948">Moreover, the Court recognizes, I think, that where the question is not separable from the merits, that what happens in the later stages may affect the view of the question for which review is now sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.560" offset="6144135">We believe that neither of those factors exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.297" offset="6163047">In this case, the case is no longer in the trial court at all; there is no problem of interfering with the trial court's ongoing discretion; and, as I tried to indicate an answer to Justice Stevens earlier, I think the administrative agency properly views itself as bound by what the district court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.479" offset="6251759">So that nothing that happens on remand can affect the nature of the question on which review is sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.182" offset="6690616">Your Honor, I want to make one thing clear here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.783" offset="6700961">The Secretary's original theory in this case was stated in his petition and in his opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.120" offset="6730322">He asked the Court to hold that a remand order under Section 405(g) was appealable as a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.710" offset="6756654">In his reply brief and... and now the Secretary has... has stated basically a new theory that he should be able to appeal a legal issue that accompanies a remand order in an Social Security case while the case is still within the jurisdiction of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.255" offset="6830842">Not only is that idea of appealing a legal issue pretty much unprecedented in... in the Court's finality jurisprudence, but, as we point out in our brief, the Secretary has no need for this overall and... and no need for it in the context of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.668" offset="6912553">And most importantly, Mr. Shapiro says that Section 405(g) is not necessary to his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.874" offset="6949333">The problem with that is that what is being proposed to be done here under Section 405(g) is totally contrary to the statutory scheme that... that is laid out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.182" offset="6994577">And... and this Court last term in Sullivan v. Hudson dealt quite extensively with the statutory scheme under Section 405(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.270" offset="7034910">And I'll get to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.647" offset="7096455">As the theory is set out in the reply brief and I believe that what Mr. Shapiro is suggesting here is simply that he can peel off the legal issue from this remand order and separate this situation out... the remand order... into two separate proceedings and thereby appeal the legal issue while the remand proceedings go back to the... to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.014" offset="7193944">He says that very clearly at page 19 of his reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.251" offset="7222887">Mr. Shapiro added that... that the vast majority of the court of appeals' decisions support the government's theory here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.874" offset="7261340">There were... the courts of appeals were probably evenly split over the old theory that he should be able to appeal the remand order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.282" offset="7302927">There is not a court of appeals' decision cited by the Secretary, and none that we can find, that supports the Secretary's new theory about peeling off this legal issue and... and appealing just the legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.823" offset="7357157">And we think clearly it's contrary to this Court's decisions, and we particularly note Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion in the Liberty Mutual case in 1976 which--</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.481" offset="13975749">The respondent, we submit, is grossly overreading the Hudson decision and in doing so is making an argument that would allow the EAJA tail to wag a very large dog, is doing so in a way which we submit is flatly inconsistent with the language in Section 405(g) and is not in the interest of claimants at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.431" offset="14067596">The Secretary's position is that if a decision is rendered for the claimant on remand, it is necessary to file the necessary... the papers in court in order that a determination of fees may be made under EAJA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.581" offset="14376154">Not only that, but I think the position he's taking is not in the interest of claimants because he is suggesting a much broader ability of the Secretary to obtain review of a decision in favor of the claimant than the Secretary believes he has under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.856" offset="14441251">Moreover, I think it clearly is in the interest of claimants to allow an appeal at this stage because if the court of appeals agrees with the district court and upholds the district court's decision that will establish the law of the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.218" offset="14506767">And the Secretary's acquiescence policy will then be that either the Secretary will seek further review in this Court or will acquiesce in the Third Circuit's decision and all future decisions will be governed by that holding.</text>
