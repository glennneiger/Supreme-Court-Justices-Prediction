            <text syncTime="10.298" offset="171110">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.162" offset="182499">On February 10th of 1989 Ronald Gene Simmons was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death by a lethal injection in the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.990" offset="237879">His execution date was set for March 16th of 1989, approximately five weeks after his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.056" offset="274137">Mr. Simmons expressed a desire that no appeal be taken in his case and that the sentence of the jury be carried out as ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.993" offset="325859">There was an intervention filed, as had been done in a previous sentence of death rendered against Mr. Simmons in the earlier case which we've called in our brief Simmons I for clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.328" offset="407152">The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled upon the question of the constitutionality of a mandatory appellate review in a death penalty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.667" offset="468592">With a rather cursory look at some of the opinions of this Court, notably Gregg v. Georgia, Jurek v. Texas, Proffitt v. Florida, the Arkansas Supreme Court found no constitutional requirement of an appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.094" offset="570261">And that trial and conviction occurred in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.380" offset="603384">The trial in February of '89 had no appellate record made, no... or no transcript prepared for appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.629" offset="660436">There was, in accordance with ruling of the Arkansas Supreme Court, a hearing held in the trial court level to determine Mr. Simmons' competency to waive appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.370" offset="731384">He was examined by a psychiatrist at the Arkansas State Hospital and was determined to be competent to make that waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.610" offset="784361">Although in a later hearing there was some reservation expressed by the examining psychiatrist concerning some more recent expressions from Mr. Simmons that may have expressed a degree of mental disorder, neither the trial court nor the reviewing court on appeal found these to be significant enough to make his waiver involuntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.892" offset="961471">In the State of Arkansas, although not constitutionally required to do so, our supreme court has committed itself since the 1970s to a system of comparative review in death penalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.705" offset="1028658">In other words, they have taken the issue that this Court looked in Pulley v. Harris and made it a part of state law to say that in each death penalty case they will review that individual's crime against other capital cases in the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.208" offset="1118728">In this instance, the state has not put Mr. Simmons' conviction and the attendant facts within that data pool that Mr. Whitmore is to be compared against.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.214" offset="1262715">At the state post-conviction stage, the State of Arkansas in its briefs conceded that Mr. Whitmore was entitled to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.103" offset="1314333">Not a concession as to the merits, but a concession as to a hearing on several grounds in his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.630" offset="2792445">Within the context of Eighth Amendment death penalty considerations, virtually anything that influences the ultimate decision to impose a penalty of death should not be considered merely trifling or even hypothetical.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.684" offset="2920654">A part of the ability to proceed in behalf of a third person is the adequacy or inadequacy of the waiver made.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.497" offset="2959838">As the Arkansas court's opinion, as set out in the joint appendix shows, they used the Rees v. Peyton test, which is the functional equivalent of competency to stand trial, to waive a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.023" offset="3041967">What they did not look at was the adequacy of how knowingly and intelligently Mr. Simmons has made this wavier.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.850" offset="3373304">Now, the trial judge, based upon representations made by trial counsel, has advised him of potential error.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.668" offset="3412592">Now, in Simmons I, the earlier case that was tried in 1988, it went into Federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.012" offset="3441954">The Federal district court appointed an independent attorney, ordered a transcript to be prepared... and, in fact, I think had to threaten the court reporter with contempt to get a transcript prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.002" offset="3505902">There was then a lengthy report filed with the Federal court outlining various potential errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.130" offset="3546444">And, in fact, that independent report on the first conviction showed at least seven grounds of reversible error, one of which would have negated the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.123" offset="3678414">But this Court has never discussed it in the context of waiving a direct first appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.951" offset="3717703">You have looked at it in collateral proceedings, post-conviction and Federal habeas, wherein the harm that we are seeking to redress here did not occur because there had been an appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.546" offset="3808086">The probably best analogy for another reason to grant standing is a review of this Court's cases in the area of the First Amendment, the heightened interest that the Court has shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.469" offset="3883737">For example, from cases going back through Raines, through NAACP v. Alabama, Griswold, Eisenstadt, the Court has not hesitated to allow...

            <text syncTime="1354.637" offset="5548468">More recently, the Court has looked at other statutes and has upheld them in part based upon the presence of that mandatory appeal feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.980" offset="5617850">Arkansas, of course, is the only one of 37 states that impose the death penalty that do not have this requirement of a non-waiverable death penalty, either by statute or by case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.960" offset="5677722">Even the State of Utah that carried out the execution of Mr. Gilmore amended its laws within six months after that execution so that it could not be carried out today in Utah without mandatory appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.805" offset="5757134">The... excuse me... the absence of that feature renders the Arkansas death penalty statute unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Simmons.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Steven Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="1655.565" offset="6752191">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.852" offset="6797330">The position of the State of Arkansas in this case is simple and direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.105" offset="6814258">First of all, Jonas Whitmore, the petitioner, does not present this Court a case in controversy, as required under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, simply because Ronald Gene Simmons is not a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.683" offset="6860651">As to the issue of his competency, he has been found competent by trial counsel and also by counsel who... psychiatry... a psychiatrist who examined him on behalf of his own retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.012" offset="6909970">He has never used incompetency as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.834" offset="6921255">He pled not guilty in either Simmons I and Simmons II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.668" offset="6936511">And, thirdly, the protected right that Jonas Whitmore so allegedly advances to this Court, or the right that should be protected by this Court that gives him standing, is one that clearly is speculative or conjecture or hypothetical because, as you have heard, in his conviction for a capital offense he was sentenced to die by injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.549" offset="7004116">He had a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.661" offset="7008504">In that direct appeal there was a proportionality review made by the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.664" offset="7028566">In its opinion, it told us specifically how it did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.237" offset="7042881">It contrasted Jonas Whitmore against other death row inmates who were guilty of crimes similar to his.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.241" offset="7066810">He took the life of one individual in a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.582" offset="7076214">His proportionality study was against two other death row inmates, Mr. Woodward and Mr. Fretwell, who also took one life in the perpetration of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.969" offset="7109755">They did not contrast him against a mass murderer, but they contrasted him against someone on death row who received the penalty of death similar to the circumstances in the case in which it was imposed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.994" offset="7145908">I submit to you that simply what we have here after the post-conviction relief was denied was a situation where Mr. Whitmore is before this Court for the reason that he would love to frustrate the death penalty process in Arkansas because by frustrating it he slows its implementation against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.176" offset="7202542">But he has no standing here, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.348" offset="7215290">He has not alleged or articulated one fact that shows that he has any particular legal interest that is at risk or at jeopardy by the state going forward with the execution of Ronald Gene Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.446" offset="7255623">But, secondly, if this Court should find for some reason that there is standing in this case, I further submit to you that the State of Arkansas' death penalty procedures are constitutional and are not violative of the Eighth Amendment, and we do not impose the penalty of death in an arbitrary, capricious or freakish manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.846" offset="7325317">This Court has said since the trilogy of cases of Proffitt and Jurek and Gregg that when you decided the case in Spaziano that there was not one right way... you didn't single out that there was one right way to have the death penalty process applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.667" offset="7380592">You further said in Pulley that when you looked at this process you looked at the whole of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.529" offset="7400028">I submit to you that the Arkansas death penalty procedures provide more than adequate safeguards to ensure that there is no arbitrary or capricious application of this penalty of death by simply providing the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.457" offset="7443704">First, in Arkansas you can only have the penalty of death imply... applied against you by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.900" offset="7469513">You cannot come forward and plead guilty and have that penalty applied by a sitting trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.935" offset="7489680">Only by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.886" offset="7493441">In our bifurcated system, in terms of death penalty cases, we must first adjudicate guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and then we move to the sentencing phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.402" offset="7527505">Additional safeguards that we find there are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.715" offset="7536700">First of all, the state must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of one of seven aggravating circumstances, and the jury must unanimously concur in that and sign that they are of that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.901" offset="7577451">We are bound by strict rules of evidence in that phase of the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.895" offset="7593438">Secondly, in that sentencing phase, the defendant is allowed to offer any evidence of mitigation that he would like to offer against the state's aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.101" offset="7630323">He is not bound by strict rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.174" offset="7638578">And the jury must conclude, again unanimously, that the aggravation beyond a reasonable doubt outweighs the mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.050" offset="7666059">Thirdly, the State of Arkansas then is required to prove to that same jury that beyond a reasonable doubt the only proper punishment that can be assessed is the penalty of death, having a jury instructed that they are permitted to impose the sentence of life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.699" offset="7728648">Meeting all of that burden, there is one additional safeguard in the Arkansas death penalty procedures, and that is one that simply says that the trial judge, after hearing... yes, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.669" offset="7800537">There was one, but her case was overturned and she's now serving life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.222" offset="7814748">There are 32 males on death row, 11 of which are black, and the remainder are white or Hispanic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.288" offset="7843064">The final safeguard, though, in the instance of a death penalty procedure in Arkansas is that once the trial judge hears the implementation of the sentence, the trial judge on his own motion can set aside the penalty of death and order the penalty of life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.875" offset="7897399">And so I'll simply say to you that those safeguards rise to a standard that ensures that the Eighth Amendment is not violated in the sense that it is arbitrarily or capriciously applied or in some freakish fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.265" offset="8158937">I think in the instance of Jonas Whitmore, had he not taken a direct appeal at this point, he still would not have standing before this Court because the proportionality review process in Arkansas is one that has never been articulated by rule by our Arkansas Supreme Court, though... or mandated by a public policy from the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.858" offset="8225288">The court simply says we do this and doesn't outline for us the practice in which or the procedure in which they do conduct this review independently and on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.915" offset="8257575">There is nothing to ensure, even if he had not taken a direct appeal that, when they contrasted the proportionality review with Jonas Whitmore, that they would include the crimes involving Ronald Gene Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.155" offset="8302506">We do know, as a matter of fact, that when he did take it to direct appeal they contrasted him by stated public opinion against people who were guilty of similar types of crimes, robbery and murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.042" offset="8342108">Not those involved in crimes in which he took the deaths of 16 individuals, which took place over a 24 or 48-hour period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.185" offset="8366663">So, our supreme court at least has given us some insight to say they contrast people on death row with similar type crimes, although there is not an articulated procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.552" offset="8404070">Thirdly, I would say to this Court, if there is some troublesome issue to this Court concerning waiver, I submit to you that there has been a clearly knowing and intelligent waiver and that the standard is actually higher than that in Arkansas, which is additional safeguards in the application of the penalty of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.822" offset="8465197">Please understand that after Simmons I was decided and Mr. Simmons said, "I want to die", his case did go forward to the Arkansas Supreme Court, advanced by Father Franz as next friend, and the Arkansas Supreme Court found no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.091" offset="8514202">And, in fact, that case went forward on habeas to the United States District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, and Judge Isley found no standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.828" offset="8609183">It said in the instance of waiving the right of appeal... and the right of appeal is automatic in Arkansas and if Ronald Gene Simmons changed his mind this very day, appeal would move forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.006" offset="8649934">If he changed his mind the hour before his execution, an appeal would move forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.417" offset="8663518">But it said... you know, it's not just knowing an intelligent waiver that's enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.371" offset="8679401">It must also be the appreciation of the difference between life and death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.485" offset="8695805">So, in Simmons II it was a two-pronged standard that was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.109" offset="8706359">And to ask whether Mr. Simmons actually knowingly and intelligently waived, the transcript of the record indicates his trial counsel pointed out seven issues for which he could potentially be successful on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.680" offset="9060579">In the instance of the seven issues, though, that were brought to Mr. Simmons' attention in Simmons II, the case at bar, the trial judge even went further than his own counsel, and his own counsel did have affidavit of record saying they had encouraged him repeatedly to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.591" offset="9120243">The trial counsel said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.572" offset="9124214">"Please, Mr. Simmons, understand so I know that you're making a knowing and intelligent waiver... please understand, all you have to do is decide one of these issues is worthy of appeal and your sentence of death will be stayed for weeks or months or years, or perhaps longer than the lives of all of us collectively in this courtroom. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.173" offset="9186594">And he said,</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.295" offset="9191087">"I waive. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.046" offset="9194117">And then he simply said to him,</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.429" offset="9203626">"Mr. Simmons, understand, the state is sincere about this... the implementation of this penalty of death. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2278.387" offset="9243437">And so there is clearly a knowing and intelligent waiver in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.299" offset="9255035">So this case, I think, fails from the petitioner's standpoint for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.083" offset="9270186">But the first and most important is he has no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.026" offset="9278023">Jonas Whitmore has no right to be here in this courtroom today because he has no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.438" offset="9295681">He's advanced no issue of a legally protected interest that needs to be guarded by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.843" offset="9317311">But, secondly, even if he did, the death penalty procedures in Arkansas don't violate the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.137" offset="9338418">Clearly, they rise to a level to afford the protection to ensure there is no arbitrary, capricious or freakish application of this penalty in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.524" offset="9371959">And so I submit to you for all those reasons that this Court should affirm the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.869" offset="10905347">Very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.402" offset="10919453">In response to Justice Kennedy's question, it bothers me very much, Your Honor, particularly when that answer is related back to an earlier statement of the Attorney General that there were seven issues presented that might have successfully set aside the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.608" offset="11016315">There were that many issues presented in Simmons I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.943" offset="11037631">Respondent has said there were that many in Simmons II.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.386" offset="11059469">What that is saying is that this may in fact be a person who is not eligible for the death penalty under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.751" offset="11096877">And Respondent is not bothered with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.267" offset="11118924">The question of retained counsel... and coming back to the adequacy of that waiver... and I believe Mr. Justice Kennedy asked about whether counsel would stay on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.306" offset="11179110">There is no indication of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.848" offset="11185275">In fact, there has been some published comments made recently that would suggest they probably will not, other than perhaps a book deal coming through on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.847" offset="11233236">I would direct the Court's attention to page 17 of those counsel's Respondent's brief only to give the Court a feel for the representation that Mr. Simmons received at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.530" offset="11315992">The counsel in there who speak of penumbras emanating from the Third Amendment in cases from this Court, who, as I said a moment ago, on that same page indicated that they were not familiar enough with the death penalty procedures in the State of Arkansas to present... to present argument on that point in this Court.</text>
