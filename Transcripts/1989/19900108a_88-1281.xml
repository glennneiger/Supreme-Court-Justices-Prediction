            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133916">We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1281, Alex Ngiraingas v. Francisco Sanchez.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.538" offset="176025">Mr. Siegel.</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_r_siegel" startTime="16.623" stopTime="211.735">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey R. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="16.623" offset="200372">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.735" offset="212806">The issue before the Court today is whether the territory of Guam is liable for deprivations of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.159" offset="238510">To answer that question the Court must address one, possibly two other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.753" offset="260871">The first of these is whether the territory is a person for the purpose of the Civil Rights Act, and if it is, whether there is some other form of sovereign immunity which may protect the territory from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.061" offset="310086">Any analysis of the word person in the Dictionary Act must begin with the Dictionary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.975" offset="333805">The Dictionary Act, passed only months before the Civil Rights Act in 1871, defined persons to include bodies politic and corporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.592" offset="372257">This Court has ruled in Puerto Rico v. Shell that the territory of Puerto Rico was indeed a body politic, and the Third Circuit has held that the territory of the Virgin Islands was a body politic as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.400" offset="427428">Indeed, if we examine the nature of the territory and the self-government invested in the territory by the Organic Act we will find, I think, that... that it makes sense to conclude that territory is indeed a body politic.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.721" offset="488763">There are free elections in the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.814" offset="497123">The citizens of the territory elect their local representatives and congressmen and a non-voting delegate to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.139" offset="530455">Indeed, there are also local courts, and a quite vibrant and active democracy exists in Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.766" offset="568907">There has been some suggestion, however, that the Dictionary Act is not applicable in defining, or at least has been somewhat diminished in defining the word person.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.512" offset="619898">The first basis on which this has been suggested is the fact that the 1871 act was taken from the 1866 Civil Rights Act, specifically Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.242" offset="666814">However, Congress, in the intervening period, did pass the Civil Rights Act, and that is persuasive evidence that Congress intended to apply that definition to the word person in Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.920" offset="721567">Respondents have argued that the 1874 revision and recodification of laws, and the repeal and reenactment of the Dictionary Act, somehow overrides this Court's finding in Monell that indeed the Dictionary Act is applicable to this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.934" offset="797635">I would also suggest that the 1874 Congress could not have effected the intentions of the 1871 Congress when it passed Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.633" offset="848417">The second factor this Court relied upon in Monell and finding municipalities to be persons were the broad construction and remedial nature of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.320" offset="887183">I would suggest that these same principles apply to include the territory within the meaning of the word person.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.406" offset="923441">Section 1983 is to be given as broad a construction as possible, and technical definitions should not be used to exclude any body politic from the term person in Section 1983.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="211.735" offset="980806">Did the Court literally say in Monell that Section 1983 was to give... to be given the broadest possible construction?</text>

            <text syncTime="222.784" offset="1025005">Why on earth would you give anything the broadest possible construction?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey R. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="226.617" offset="1040365">Well, the broadest construction consistent with the terms used.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.880" offset="1053426">I think the Court's intention was to not hang the liability or applicability of Section 1983 upon some technical reading of the statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="241.807" stopTime="247.691">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="241.807" offset="1101074">Well, the broadest possible construction, I suppose, would include states.</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_r_siegel" startTime="247.691" stopTime="295.555">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey R. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="247.691" offset="1124584">I think there is an argument to be made for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.684" offset="1140571">However, in Will, and I think the substance of Will is that the interest of federalism in the Eleventh Amendment override that broad construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.932" offset="1181635">Indeed, it makes sense that Congress would not intend, given the context of the act, that states would be liable under... states would be persons for the purpose of Section 1983 given their Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.362" offset="1243284">And the petitioners would submit that that is indeed the overriding considerations this Court employed in Will, in holding that states were not persons, that they are given a special respect and special sovereignty by the Constitution and the federalist system.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="295.555" stopTime="309.854">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="295.555" offset="1316114">Well,... sort of a standard rule of construction that if you, if you intend to include a sovereign or a state you ought to say so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_r_siegel" startTime="309.854" stopTime="352.073">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey R. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="309.854" offset="1373269">The rule of construction I think Justice White is referring to is that person does not ordinarily include the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.448" offset="1407647">However, that is not a hard-and-fast rule, as this Court ruled in Omaha, in Wilson v. The Omaha Tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.545" offset="1436068">The Court must examine the purpose and context, as well as the legislative history of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.987" offset="1461772">Congress would never, and has never indeed, considered any territory to be a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.982" offset="1489776">Congress is the plenary sovereign over any territory, and certainly over Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.527" offset="1516003">I suggest then, that given that context and given that understanding of Congress,--</text>

            <text syncTime="392.599" offset="1704293">I'm saying that it is illogical to consider that Congress would have intended to immunize a territory, which is a creature of Federal law, from an act of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.425" offset="1747552">The logic of Polyblank is that the territory itself creates the rights which flow to the citizens of the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.193" offset="1794677">Therefore, it is immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.604" offset="1804290">That's the explicit language.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.266" offset="1810977">I would suggest that there, that any immunity from the Federal law must be a matter of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.723" offset="1840757">And there is no tradition of immunity from Federal law in territories, because they are indeed creations of Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.649" offset="4164505">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.695" offset="4192613">Whether the government of Guam is liable under Section 1983 is a question of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.938" offset="4221661">What did Congress intend concerning the territories in 1874, not 1871, but 1874, when territories were added to the 1871 Civil Rights Act, and what did Congress intend in Guam's Organic Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.050" offset="4286027">Now, Petitioners would disregard Guam's mandate for self-government in its Organic Act, and Petitioners would avoid the intent of Congress to allow the people of Guam, through their duly elected legislators, to balance the interests of private litigants and the goals of public government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.241" offset="4350811">One of the first things you can look at is the purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1874.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.034" offset="4377978">A major purpose was to provide a Federal forum to enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.909" offset="4405459">Local officials in the states either would not or could not grant the citizens the equal protection, due processes and privileges and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.168" offset="4450494">However, in territories the situation is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.481" offset="4463764">And I think there is some confusion here about the courts of the territories, because the territories had Congress... Congress established the courts in the territories, and Congress... or the President appointed the judges that presided over those courts in the territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.562" offset="4528130">In... you can see in the 1874 revision and consolidation of the Federal laws, the provisions common to all territories, it indicates that under Federal law the Congress had a Supreme Court in each territory with three judges who were appointed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.516" offset="4611931">And then the territories were divided into three judicial districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.800" offset="4629067">And one of those judges, then, would preside in that judicial district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.763" offset="4648920">And then the courts in those districts would... the judges in those districts would hold court</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.308" offset="4679118">"for the purpose of hearing and determining all matters and cases, except those which United States is a party. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.972" offset="4709733">So these were courts appointed by Congress, or created by Congress, and these were judges appointed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.990" offset="4741812">And if a 1983 action was to be brought in the territories, it would be brought in those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.728" offset="4780786">So, we didn't have the same situation as we had in the states, where they needed to provide a Federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.601" offset="4804296">In fact, the courts of the territories were, in the sense that they were created for the territories by the Federal Government with judges appointed by the President, a Federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.839" offset="4845256">So that purpose really doesn't apply in the territories as it did in the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.892" offset="5041384">That district court had all jurisdiction, but then they allowed the legislature of Guam to create such other courts as it decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.707" offset="5072731">And so, one year later the legislature created well, basically the island court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.962" offset="5097704">But it... at that point it left jurisdiction in the district court for most felony cases and for cases... civil cases above $2,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.061" offset="5142112">So, there again, if you had a civil rights action at that time brought in a court of Guam it would be brought in the district court unless it was less than $2,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.116" offset="5174295">But, so... but in 18... in 1974 then the legislature went ahead and created the Superior Court of Guam, which at that time then actions under Federal law were brought in the district court and actions under local law were brought in the Superior Court of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.099" offset="5258305">But the appeals from this superior court still go to the District Court of Guam before, and then to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.306" offset="5291114">So District Court of Guam still has that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.308" offset="5303131">But in 1874, if we look at the intent of the Congress when it added territories, you can see that at that time... what they were trying to get at that a Federal forum did exist in the territories at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.658" offset="5360496">The situation on Guam that happened in 1974 didn't apply to the territories at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.542" offset="5388081">Another important thing, of course, in deciding what the intent of Congress was is the common law sovereign immunity that existed in the territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.691" offset="5436669">And this Court has held that Congress did not intend to override established common law defenses and immunities without specific language to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.129" offset="5478360">In 1874 the territories had an established tradition of immunity from suit without its consent, and this Court so held in the Kawananakoa case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.808" offset="5529142">And in fact in that case this Court specifically rejected the argument that was made that territories are like municipal corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.224" offset="5570729">And the Court held that the territories had immunity by the nature of the type of government that was created in their Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.961" offset="5609704">And then in the Rosaly case in 1913, this Court then applied that reasoning to the unincorporated territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.146" offset="5642409">There were, of course, only incorporated territories in 1874, but the reasoning was applied to the unincorporated territories, which Guam is, in 1913 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.925" offset="5685563">Now, Petitioners argue that Kawananakoa and Rosaly don't apply, because that means there is only sovereign immunity in the local courts under local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.152" offset="5738435">Well, what that overlooks, of course, as I talked about a minute ago, is the nature of the court system in the territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.549" offset="5772081">And in fact these congressionally created courts were the local courts, although they were created by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.683" offset="5800607">And they were to hear all matters and cases, and that would include 19... Section 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.878" offset="5833416">And also, Kawananakoa was a... the action where immunity was held... was upheld was actually brought in one of those congressionally created courts, and the immunity was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.337" offset="5887229">And also, Kawananakoa cites with approval three prior territory cases, which are Wisconsin v. Doty, Langford v. King, and Fisk v. Cuthbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.087" offset="5934249">And there again, those were cases in which immunity was upheld and the courts in which the cases were brought were these congressionally created territorial courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.329" offset="6527229">But what we're saying is it does apply in those very courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.014" offset="6545932">And those very courts were the ones in which the Kawananakoa case was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.109" offset="6566308">The other thing we can look at, and this is... this is... specifically is the definition of the word person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.295" offset="6603088">We can look at the act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.946" offset="6609671">And I think again there was some confusion because territories were not in the act in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.913" offset="6649482">It was only prohibitions for persons acting under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.928" offset="6673619">It wasn't until 1874 that territories were added.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.471" offset="6687725">And in 1874, when territories were added, that was, in that same act, was when the Dictionary Act was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.056" offset="6718132">And it was changed from bodies corporate, or politic and corporate to partnerships and corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.102" offset="6746239">Therefore, in that same act... and the reason for the change was stated by the committee, was so that the... a drafter of a Federal statute would not have to take care to exclude states, territories, foreign governments and the like from the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.913" offset="6809560">So here, when territories are specifically added, the definition under Federal law does not include territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.451" offset="6843624">Another indication of congressional intent in both 1874, and this has to do with Guam also, is... and an indication that the Federal... the Congress is really treating territories like states, was the provision that was in the Organic Acts of the territories at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.084" offset="6926171">And this is in the provisions common to all territories, it is stated that the Constitution and all laws of the United States which are not locally inapplicable, of course 18... Section 1983 had been made locally applicable in 1874, those which are not locally inapplicable shall have the same force and effect in the organized territories as elsewhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.982" offset="7025749">So those laws were to have the same force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.513" offset="7035885">Then on Guam in 1968 the Fourteenth Amendment was specifically added to the Organic Act and those rights that were in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.210" offset="7082696">And when the Congress added that provision it specifically stated in that same amendment the provisions, and that would include those provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, shall have the same force and effect as in the United States or in any state of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.333" offset="7155212">It went on to say in that same amendment all laws of Congress in the Guam legislature inconsistent with this are repealed to the extent of their inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.412" offset="7199516">So I think that this indicates that the residents of Guam, like the residents of the states, in Section 1983 action were to have the same rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.309" offset="7247059">They were to have rights against individuals who violated their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.173" offset="7266598">But it did not provide for damages against the territory governments, just like it didn't in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.638" offset="7292407">Now, if we... another indication, of course, is the role in 1874 that the Federal Government played in financing this... the territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.506" offset="7339846">At that time there were, under the provisions common to all territories, there were direct appropriations by Congress to the territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.643" offset="7372447">And they paid the expenses of the legislature and government appointed officials, and there was even a direct appropriation, a contingency expense for the Territory of Washington of $1,500 and of $1,000 for the other territories then existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.095" offset="7438275">And because of the direct financial role that Congress played, it's doubtful that they would intend to incur liability for the territories without specifically saying so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.262" offset="7482892">Now, the other indication of intent, we go to the Organic Act of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.187" offset="7510582">And when Congress exercised its plenary control and created the government of Guam in 1950, it created one of those entities it had under Kawananakoa: common law sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.356" offset="7567320">We have to remember, before 1950, if you brought a suit against the administering body of the territory of Guam, you brought it against the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.733" offset="7604832">So it was a suit against the Department of the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.626" offset="7612355">It wasn't until 1950 that the government of Guam was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.130" offset="7630432">And they created one of those bodies in the tradition of the territories that had common law sovereign immunity with separate branches of government with separate powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.846" offset="7673273">But there was a question then even whether you could sue the government of Guam, even if they consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.632" offset="7700440">So in 1959 the Congress corrected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.484" offset="7719771">And in corrected that, they gave... stated clearly in the situations in which immunity would be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.980" offset="7757805">They said that the government of Guam could be sued with the consent of the legislature evidenced by enacted law in contract and in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.798" offset="7797093">And the Assistant Secretary of the Interior submitted a letter with the bill when it went before the Congress, and he indicated in there the purpose was to allow the officials, or the elected officials of the territory to determine when the best interests of the territory would be served, you know, by balancing private litigants against public goals of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.841" offset="7885178">Now, the Guam legislature has struck the balance under which authority they were given by Congress, and they have allowed negligence actions against the government with a maximum of $100,000 for wrongful death and $300,000 for personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.342" offset="7947245">The petitioners' claim would allow unlimited damages for intentional torts under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.850" offset="7989250">Now, this would negate the intent of Congress and negate the intent of Guam's duly elected officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.556" offset="8016104">Therefore, we feel that since the intent of Congress, at least in 1959, it is explicitly clear with respect to torts, and it says we are going to let the Guam legislature balance the interests in this, in cases of tort.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.311" offset="8903118">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.391" offset="8971454">The position of the United States is that, for the reasons given in our brief, first, Guam is not a person for purposes of Section 1983, and second, Guam is entitled to assert sovereign immunity as a defense to this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.931" offset="9025580">In other words, because Guam is a self-governing entity much like states, it is entitled to be treated as a state would be treated for purposes of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.839" offset="9065181">I would like to make three major points this afternoon, other... among those that are made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.794" offset="9093080">First, with respect to the question of whether Guam is to be considered a person, there is direct and rather conclusive evidence that the Congress that added the words 1874 did not intend to include territories within the scope of the word person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.026" offset="9157968">And, in addition, that that Congress did intend that states and territories be treated alike for purposes of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.782" offset="9189002">Second, this Court has repeatedly stated that 19... that Section 1983 was not intended to override well accepted common law notions of immunities and defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.601" offset="9232260">In 1874, in fact both in 1874 and before and after that date, the idea of territorial sovereign immunity was well accepted in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.517" offset="9275937">Congress would therefore not have expected that a territory would be liable under Section 1983, and under this Court's reasoning in Will and a whole line of other cases, did not intend to make a territory liable under Section 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.271" offset="9354932">No, I don't believe there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.913" offset="9361514">For one thing, in 1874 when this Congress acted, there was no such distinction in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.959" offset="9385652">But, in any event, when that distinction came into the law just after the turn of the century, it was primarily for purposes of determining which constitutional rights apply to a territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.155" offset="9426507">It was not for purposes of determining whether sovereign immunity applied to a territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.509" offset="9451898">And, indeed, when... as has already been pointed out, when the Court reached those issues in the Hawaii case, Hawaii was an incorporated territory, I believe at the time, and the Court held that it was entitled to the sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.406" offset="9499441">And when the Court reached it in Puerto Rico, which was not an incorporated territory, the Court held the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.797" offset="9621067">The District of Columbia is a bit more difficult a case for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.781" offset="9636949">First, the District... the statute, as it reads now, includes states, territories and the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.415" offset="9663490">Now, states and territories are categories of entities, but the District of Columbia is an individual unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.719" offset="9688776">There is only one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.751" offset="9692852">And that possibly may indicate that the District of Columbia after all does have a sui generis quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.318" offset="9723154">But in any event, the relevant congressional intent with respect to the District of Columbia was that of the 1979 Congress that added the District of Columbia to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.236" offset="9770801">And that Congress was acting in a rather different legal environment than were the Reconstruction Congresses in the 1870s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.482" offset="9799745">Therefore, in short, I don't... I think you would have to look specifically at that action to determine the status of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.976" offset="9829733">But insofar as the District of Columbia is a fully self-governing entity, and Congress intended to make it such, I think many of our arguments would apply to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.221" offset="9866723">It... my third point... well, my third point I wanted to make today was that with respect to sovereign immunity issues, there is no substantial dispute that Guam is, as a general matter, entitled to assert sovereign immunity, both as a result of the Organic Acts and as a result of the long-established tradition of territorial common law sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.067" offset="9954180">Petitioner asserts, however, that Guam is not entitled to assert its sovereign immunity in the courts of a separate sovereign or in cases arising under the laws of a separate sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.974" offset="9989812">Now, in fact, Guam is not an entirely separate sovereign from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.728" offset="10008724">But even if it were seen as a separate sovereign, the law has been fairly clear since the very early years of this country, and you could look at Judge... at Chief Justice Marshall's decision in The Schooner Exchange case, that a sovereign that is entitled to assert immunity is entitled to do so both in its own courts and in the courts of the United States, and both with respect to causes of action arising under its own laws and under those arising under the laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.579" offset="10184163">It really... the sovereign immunity issue arises... was not passed on by the court of appeals, and arises only if the Court were to determine, contrary to our argument, that Guam were a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.247" offset="10222824">Then it... you... it... the issue of sovereign immunity would have to be confronted by someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.440" offset="10239647">It could be remanded to the court of appeals, but it has been fully briefed here and this Court could choose to decide it also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.346" offset="10263261">With respect to the Dictionary Act, I think most of the important points have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.913" offset="10305475">It was the 18... the very same Congress, in fact in the very same piece of legislation that added the word "or territory" to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.650" offset="10336509">It was that very same Congress at the same time that changed the Dictionary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.750" offset="10352914">Now, although we don't have any specific commentary relating to the addition of the word "or territory", we do have specific commentary cited in the brief of Respondent for the meaning of the word person at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.862" offset="10409338">And the Revision Commission indicated both, that the word person should not ordinarily apply to states, territories or foreign governments, and that that why... that was why it was recommending the change in the Dictionary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.852" offset="10461269">I would suggest that this is relevant both because it establishes that that Congress did not intend to include territories within the scope of the word person, and because that Congress intended that states and territories be treated alike for purposes of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.452" offset="10523650">There is no indication of any contrary congressional intent about this issue, and indeed, this Revision Commission note is in full accord with the statement in Will that the word person does not ordinarily include the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.970" offset="10577776">In fact, it applies... it supplies conclusive evidence that that Congress felt that those entities entitled to sovereign immunity, states, territories and foreign governments, were not... were not generally intended to be encompassed within the word person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.240" offset="10638798">With respect to the... with respect to the sovereign... a second basis for holding that that Congress did not intend to include territories within the scope of the word person, is the long history of sovereign immunity that is cited in the briefs and that has been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.953" offset="10721658">I would point out, in addition to that, that having decided... made... having decided the Will case the way the Court did, the evidence that Congress intended states and territories to be treated the same for this statute, and in fact that the Court had in the past and has in the past treated territories and states as a general matter of common law sovereign immunity in identical fashion, would suggest that the same result should be reached here as was reached in the Will state... Will case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.922" offset="10829596">It would be odd to say that the Congress that was interested in protecting civil rights in the southern states in the 1870s intended that Section 1983 apply with greater force to territories than to states, when the addition of territories to the statute was, after all, just an afterthought on Congress' part, made three years later, and was not... the focus of Congress's intention, of course, at that time was on enforcement of constitutional rights in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.442" offset="10951640">With respect to the sovereign immunity issue, if the Court were to reach it, the... I don't think, in response to Justice Stevens' question before, that Nevada v. Hall establishes that Guam could not... that Guam sovereign immunity should not be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.544" offset="11024052">Nevada v. Hall recognized the long tradition of comity, and recognized that the general rule is that sovereign immunity would be recognized in the courts of a different sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.261" offset="11062922">Of course, in the case of Nevada v. Hall, California had specific reasons of policy relating to California's own lack of sovereign immunity that it asserts itself, and also the fact that Nevada... what was at issue in the case was a car driven by someone from Nevada in California, not to apply sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.086" offset="11142229">I don't think in this case there is any overriding policy concerning the application of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.122" offset="11170337">In fact, all of the considerations are that this Court and Congress--</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.055" offset="11186115">Well, if we thought Congress had meant to include Guam as a person, that would be a fairly strong overriding policy, wouldn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.379" offset="11211402">If we... because your argument is making that assumption now, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="2780.728" offset="11256750">--Well, Congress may have intended that Guam be treated as a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.502" offset="11267826">First of all, I think the two issues of sovereign immunity and as treatment as a person are independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.535" offset="11287993">The Court said that, I think both the majority and the dissent in the Will case, and it said that a number of other times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.989" offset="11313802">In fact, in the pre-Will cases where the Court held, for instance in Alabama v. Pugh, that a state could be sued only with its consent, it must have been assuming at that point that even if a state were a person it would still be entitled to a sovereign immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.361" offset="11375346">And therefore it could waive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.880" offset="11381407">So I think that they are two independent issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.263" offset="11402932">In addition, that would have some bite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.904" offset="11413485">Guam has waived its sovereign immunity for some purposes, as was pointed out, and Guam could waive its... might waive sovereign immunity in such a way as to bring it within Section 1983, even though it might assert sovereign immunity in other cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey R. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="2841.870" offset="11501361">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.493" offset="11515885">This Court stated in Polyblank that the sovereign is exempt from suit not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.545" offset="11596029">I think it's clear that it was the intention of the Court, and the only tradition of immunity with respect to territories is for acts arising under territorial law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.555" offset="11648065">I think amicus has a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.787" offset="11661021">It says on one hand that Guam is sovereign enough, has enough self-government to be treated for a state... as a state for Section 1983 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.071" offset="11698115">However, when this argument is raised, that it is not an immunity which extends to acts under Federal law, amicus says well, it is not really a separate sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.560" offset="11744091">And I think that points up the reasoning of this Court's prior decisions concerning Section 1983 in the Eleventh Amendment, specifically that it is... the Eleventh Amendment had always... has always played an enormous role in determining governmental liability under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.995" offset="11821831">Indeed, the Court did not hold in Monell that simply cities are liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.719" offset="11840744">It said that arms of the state, arms... entities which are not arms of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes, is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.778" offset="11877002">I will suggest that there will be no finding, if we review the legislative history, of any comment in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.580" offset="11904169">But that is the conclusion that the Court drew from the use of the word person and the legislative context of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.436" offset="11939591">I think it's appropriate to maintain that as a... as at least a guide or a consideration, as the Court said in Will, in determining the scope of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.436" offset="11987656">With respect to Respondent's point that initially the only courts existing in territories were Federal courts, I will suggest that in 1871 or 1874 Congress was well aware that the territories were going to become states, and at some point state courts would be established in what would become states, formerly territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.793" offset="12093087">I'd suggest, then, that that in no way diminishes the Court's point in Will that the purpose... one of the purposes of Section 1983 was to provide a Federal forum for vindication of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.164" offset="12154527">Much has also been made of the 1874 revision of the Dictionary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.620" offset="12184306">But the more specific and applicable revision was to Section 1983, declaring that acts under color of territoriel law were now subject to liability.</text>
