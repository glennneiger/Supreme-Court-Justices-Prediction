            <label>Mr. John H. Blume</label>
            <text syncTime="12.099" offset="171203">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.742" offset="181756">The question presented in this case is whether Arizona v. Roberson created a new rule of law for retroactivity purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.188" offset="211536">The court of appeals held, with five judges dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, that although the facts of this case were not distinguishable from Roberson, that Roberson was not applicable because it was not the law at the time of Mr. Butler's trial in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.508" offset="268796">Since the court of appeals' decision, the law of retroactivity has changed somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.151" offset="287395">In Teague v. Lane, this Court held that new rules of criminal procedure do not apply to cases which are final on direct review at the time the new rule is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.249" offset="327728">However, common to all of this Court's retroactivity decisions, is the following principle which is dispositive to this case: when a decision of this Court had done nothing more than apply subtle precedent to a different fact situation, no real question arises as to retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.740" offset="397737">Because Arizona v. Roberson was nothing more than a straightforward application of Edwards v. Arizona, to a slightly different set of facts, it applies retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.356" offset="440160">The first place to look, I believe, is the, this Court's decision in Roberson.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.718" offset="461684">In the first paragraph of the majority opinion, the Court stated that the Attorney General of Arizona asked us to craft an exception to the rule of Edwards for cases in which the police wish to interrogate an individual about charges which are unrelated to the crime for which the person initially invoked the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.121" offset="535245">This Court rejected, by a vote of six to two, the Attorney General's proffer distinction of Edwards, and the opinion clearly reveals that this Court believed that Roberson was directly within the logical compass of Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.440" offset="592506">Thus, as was true in Yates v. Aiken, another South Carolina retroactivity case decided by this Court two terms ago, this case does not involve a new rule of law.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="128.199" offset="635555">But every... every decision of ours is... almost every decision of ours is within the logical compass of another decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.879" offset="742240">The hard facts of Teague, of course, do involve a situation which would require overruling, and the language... however, of course, I think Teague must go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.816" offset="774004">I agree with Justice Scalia, with you to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.420" offset="784453">However, the language of Teague, I believe, was that if the result is not dictated by prior precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.813" offset="805978">Roberson certainly is dictated by the rule of Edwards, and in essence what the State of Arizona asked was this Court to craft an exception to the rule, not to extend the rule, but to create an exception, and this Court declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.011" offset="862821">I think if this Court determines that any time there is an intellectually tenable distinction of one of your cases, that the resolution and rejection of that distinction creates a new rule, then you will in effect be skewing the constitutional balance, and putting a premium on the most grudging interpretation of everything this Court holds, rather than a more faithful interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.177" offset="963444">The reason we sought to draw it, I thought, was that we came to the conclusion that the main purpose of habeas is to make sure that the state courts are behaving lawfully and doing their best, you know, to follow federal precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.058" offset="1023004">Now, you think they are behaving unlawfully whenever they would, let's say, reject... well, let's use the term exception, reject a perfectly plausible claim for an exception that they thought we might accept.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Blume</label>
            <text syncTime="241.018" offset="1086847">I think the purpose underlying the rule is does the state have a legitimate, essentially reliance interest, in expecting that the decision will be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.413" offset="1120388">If the definition of what is a new rule is drawn too narrowly, then essentially the states will have an incentive to offer whatever distinctions they have of any case, rather... that are beyond the hard facts of a particular holding, rather than applying the decision more faithfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.354" offset="1184231">For example, Edwards contemplates that the police will conduct their behavior in conformity with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.527" offset="1212862">If they don't, then we expect prosecutors will not offer those confessions, and if they do the state judges won't admit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.842" offset="1238148">But, if any time a distinction is rejected that creates a new rule, then police, prosecutors and state judges have no incentive to apply this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.531" offset="1288930">Rather, prosecutors will offer the confession, the resulting confession and any distinctions they can offer in support of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.397" offset="1320382">Now, those distinctions may prevail or may not in convincing a federal judge that Edwards is not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.354" offset="1352146">But nevertheless, the state would win either way, for the rejection of the distinction would itself create a new rule and would deprive that person and everyone within that temporal cohort of the benefit of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.824" offset="1398017">And that essentially is the Attorney General's argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.407" offset="1408362">That the State of Arizona... that the Arizona Attorney General, by litigating Roberson all the way to this Court, and losing and having its distinction rejected, should deprive everyone between Edwards and Roberson of the benefit of Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.157" offset="1471369">And that doesn't seem to be a fair interpretation of what can be a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.891" offset="1490386">Every member of this Court agreed in the opinions in either Teague or in Penry that Yates v. Aiken was a case which did not involve a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.490" offset="1548692">Yates was a case decided two terms ago, and the question presented in Yates was whether Francis v. Franklin created a new rule, or rather was merely an application of Sandstrom v. Montana to a different set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.270" offset="1595817">This case is very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.211" offset="1603653">Just as Francis merely applied Sandstrom, Roberson merely was an application of Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.045" offset="1635000">Thus, because Roberson and Edwards are distinct... are not distinguishable, and because Roberson was within the logical compass of Edwards, the real question presented in this case is whether Edwards is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.483" offset="1684737">Because Mr. Butler's case was on direct review at the time Edwards was decided, Edwards is clearly applicable, Roberson is clearly applicable, and the court of appeals decision was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.801" offset="1729982">For these reasons, the decision of the court of appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.051" offset="1782958">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="420.214" offset="1803647">The issue being presented before this Court is whether Arizona v. Roberson, a decision of this Court during the last term, has retroactive application under this Court's analysis in Teague v. Lane to a situation in which a confession was entered in 1980 and an appeal was raised that was resolved in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.348" offset="1888179">It is our position that the decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, when it concluded that Arizona v. Roberson should not be applied in this case, is well founded in the decisions of this particular Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.308" offset="1940006">In the Fourth Circuit's decision, it stated that we are fully satisfied that Butler may not claim any retroactive benefit from Roberson.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.643" offset="1977309">In their panel decision the court held that the interrogation was conducted in strict accordance with the established law in 1980, and there was no support in the record that there was any actual violation of his Fifth Amendment rights in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.935" offset="2042511">The court found in its lower decision that it was undisputed at the time of the trial and all the way through the court that Butler twice evidences knowing consent to interrogation without the presence of counsel by signing his waiver with full understanding of his rights to counsel, particularly asserting that he did not want to have a lawyer represent him in these particular proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.279" offset="2223905">There was a statement given.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.570" offset="2229025">Subsequent to that statement being given on August 31st, there was a bond hearing on the unrelated assault charge, at which time, and for the first time, we would submit, retained counsel appeared on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.720" offset="2281688">Later that evening, after, we would submit, there was a reasonable opportunity for Mr. Butler to have consulted with his counsel, at approximately 12:50 in the morning, which would be on September 1st, 1980, another interrogation began.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.001" offset="2342814">At the outset of that interrogation, it is undisputed before this Court, we would submit, that Sergeant Frasier did give his Miranda warnings to Mr. Butler, first orally, then in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.073" offset="2399030">Mr. Butler then gave an initial statement in which he acknowledged some knowledge of the particular murder that he was charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.378" offset="2428287">It is important to note that at the outset of the interrogation, before the Miranda warnings were given, Sergeant Frasier particularly advised him that you are being charged now with the murder of Pamela Lane and that will be the focus of the particular inquiry in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.500" offset="2492757">During the Miranda warnings that were given after that information was given to him, on two occasions Mr. Butler advised him, when asked about his knowledge of his right to counsel, he asserted clearly, unequivocally, I do not want a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.128" offset="2547301">I do not want a lawyer in these particular matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.920" offset="2558481">And then he chose to give his statement, his initial statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.702" offset="2573632">When further information was revealed to him by Sergeant Frasier, after the initial statement was given, Miranda warnings were again presented to him, he waived his right to counsel, sustenance during the interrogation, again at that time, and entered a statement in which he admitted some significant involvement in this crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.003" offset="3478827">On basically the same grounds that we have asserted in our second response, that it would not have applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.318" offset="3500039">And the court, on the basis of the assumption that it presented, did not accept that, and we have raised that in our petition... opposition to the petition for certiorari, and we have raised that before this Court as our second argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.097" offset="3551134">But we would submit that, under this Court's decision in Arizona v. Roberson, that the Teague requirements that this is a new rule, we submit, would be clearly applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.087" offset="3607141">This was the first time... not this, but the court's decision in Arizona v. Roberson, was in fact the first time that this Court had specifically addressed the Edwards situation to a situation where there were separate interrogations.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.160" offset="3679448">In Arizona v. Roberson, it focused on two separate investigations at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.355" offset="3700241">The common element between these cases and this case was a continuous custody, but a significant difference was that in Arizona v. Roberson and in Edwards v. Arizona counsel was requested but was never permitted to discuss the matters with the accused under those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.928" offset="3774533">Whereas, in our situation, counsel was made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.989" offset="3786759">Roberson was the first case to apply Edwards bright-line test by this Court to separate investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.636" offset="3817270">We would submit it is a new rule because Edwards itself concerned the same particular investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.700" offset="3841616">As the dissent in Roberson noted, the rule now would bar law enforcement officers from questioning suspects about an unrelated matter if in custody, and that he has requested counsel to assist in that particular interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.199" offset="3903578">In the prior decisions of this Court, particularly Maine v. Moulton, the Court held, in footnote 16, that incriminating evidence from statements pertaining to other crimes as to which the Sixth Amendment, right to counsel, had not attached, are admissible in the trial on those particular offenses, even though that same information and the results of those types of interrogations or information would not be admissible in a trial on the original crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.566" offset="4057074">In Moran v. Burbine, the Court again affirmed the Court's decision in Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.540" offset="4080897">But particularly noting how this matter would be considered a new rule was Justice Burger's... Chief Justice Burger's dissent in Maine v. Moulton, where he acknowledged in 1986 that until the day the prevailing view in the state and federal courts was that the case law up to that time, under Messiah and its successors, did not protect the defendant from the introduction of post-indictment statements deliberately elicited when the police undertook an investigation for separate crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.689" offset="4193537">We would submit that those types of understandings, that was presented throughout the United States by the state court jurisdictions, clearly revealed that when a separate investigation is involved, Arizona v. Roberson, as it applied the Edwards situation, created a new rule of criminal procedure that did not exist, we would submit, prior to the time Roberson was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.085" offset="4291131">Many state courts, we noted in our brief, have taken the position that, since Edwards and since Maine v. Moulton, have accepted the view that Edwards did not apply to separate investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.805" offset="4337942">Like Edwards before Roberson, we would submit, is a new rule of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.348" offset="4360199">Edwards v. Roberson is not a matter of a constitutional command, but, however, it is a court-made rule of procedure that, we would submit, do not require the application under the retroactivity principles of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.109" offset="4423206">Here, in Edwards and in Roberson, it was developed to protect from police badgering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.815" offset="4450060">The constitutional issue... the current constitutional issue and the constitutional issue that was available to the defendant at the time of his trial in 1981, was whether he knows and understands his constitutional rights and is willing to waive them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.666" offset="4509410">In conclusion on this particular issue, since Roberson is a new guideline, it should not be applied to collateral review, since it does not fall within either the Teague exceptions or it did not create a new rule under those particular exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.179" offset="4575448">As each state court that has addressed this issue has held, and the federal courts below, Butler made a knowing and voluntary statement without coercion, and he waived his Fifth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel during the interrogation in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.548" offset="4640963">The written and oral warnings were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.511" offset="4648800">A clear and unequivocal waiver was made on the record, and no request for the assistance of counsel on the murder charge was ever done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.815" offset="4678057">Now, some nine years later, Butler seeks to have a technical change in the law applied, where the evidence is undisputed that he knowingly waived his right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.073" offset="4719017">Habeas corpus relief, where a fundamentally fair trial was held and where the opportunity to litigate this issue at the time of the state trial was available to him, should not allow, where the truth-finding function was not tainted, to allow for him to have a new trial on these particular charges without the admission of this evidence which was proper under the law in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.210" offset="4811595">In our second argument, we would submit that Edwards v. Arizona is factually and legally distinguishable from Butler's case because Butler never requested the assistance of counsel during any of his interrogations and, unlike Edwards and Roberson, and the counsel met with Mr. Butler prior to the interrogation that was done on this particular charge that resulted in the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.368" offset="4924235">Particularly, we have noted that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached on the assault charges; however, he never requested the assistance of counsel at any time during any interrogation which was protected by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.798" offset="4985988">The critical fact is that Butler failed to request his assistance during any interrogation, and that counsel was made available to him for purposes of the bond hearing on the assault charge, where there was a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.629" offset="5041263">The concerns of the Fifth Amendment right to have counsel's assistance during a custodial interrogation were satisfied, as we have asserted, when counsel was made available with a reasonable opportunity to meet with him during that time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.208" offset="5099568">The record before this Court reveals that he did in fact meet with him at the time of the jail.</text>
