            <text syncTime="9.442" offset="124851">This case is here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.858" offset="138539">The question it presents is as follows: In determining whether there is diversity of citizenship between the parties as is required for federal diversity jurisdiction, complete diversity is required, that is, all the plaintiffs must be citizens of different states from all the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.009" offset="211159">We have long held that the citizenship of a corporate plaintiff or defendant for these purposes is not the citizenship of all of its shareholders but rather the state of the corporation’s incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.214" offset="263927">For ordinary partnerships, however, we have long held that the citizenship of all the partners must be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.046" offset="299244">In this case, the plaintiff, Arkoma Associates, is a limited partnership organized under the laws of Arizona suing two individual citizens of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.485" offset="341040">One of Arkoma’s limited partners is also a citizen of Louisiana which would destroy the complete diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.952" offset="370924">The issue is whether at law, it does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.994" offset="387016">The District Court held not, and denied a motion to dismiss on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.653" offset="405719">The Fifth Circuit affirmed holding that only the citizenship of Arkoma’s general partners was relevant for determining whether there is complete diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.743" offset="442082">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.261" offset="460159">Arkoma cannot itself be considered a citizen of the state of its organization as that term is used in the diversity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.793" offset="490252">We have steadfastly refused in the past to accord to unincorporated associations the unique treatment that we give to corporations for that purpose rather, in a suit by or against an unincorporated association, we have looked to the citizenship of all the association’s members to determine whether there is complete diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.483" offset="564962">Arkoma argues that courts should make an exception to this rule in a case of limited partnerships and should look to the citizenship of only the general but not the limited partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.277" offset="608221">Arkoma argues that this exception is required by the realities of modern business organizations like limited partnerships, in which only the general partners control the litigation in the day to day operations of the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.512" offset="657122">The proposed exception is not supported by our cases and we decline to adopt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.964" offset="674885">Arkoma’s arguments are more properly addressed to Congress and to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.499" offset="693066">Magee Drilling Company and intervenor below asks that we affirm the judgment with respect to it because diversity of citizenship indisputably exist between it and Arkoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.504" offset="733086">This question was not considered by the Court of Appeals and we leave it to be decided in the first instance on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.525" offset="757223">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.099" offset="775509">Justice O’Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun have joined.</text>
