            <text syncTime="8.437" offset="174410">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.522" offset="186844">I will be sharing argument this morning with someone from the Solicitor General's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.926" offset="204398">I will summarize the facts and address the nature of the claim before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.746" offset="223729">He will then address the case law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.546" offset="234909">My intention is to reserve five minutes of our allotted time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.817" offset="256016">Vera English worked for nearly 12 years in a laboratory at General Electric's nuclear fuel processing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.339" offset="286109">She did analysis to assure the quality of material placed in nuclear fuel rods.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.160" offset="309306">Over the years she made a number of complaints concerning safety and quality, both to General Electric's management and to the NRC.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.449" offset="342534">As a result of those complaints, on March 15, 1984, she was removed from her job in the analytical lab; and on July 30th of that same year, she was discharged from her employment with General Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.858" offset="408153">We have alleged, and for purposes of this appeal it must be accepted as true, that the actions taken against Mrs. English were indeed taken in retaliation for her reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.166" offset="453397">In fact, the Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge found that she was the victim of retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.987" offset="480669">He also found that GE's witnesses were just not believable in attributing the actions against to concerns that she might endanger other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.295" offset="529884">But I want to make it clear that we are not here relitigating the Section 210 action under a state law theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.400" offset="562276">This is an intentional infliction of emotional distress case, and the issues that will be before a jury at a trial of this matter are significantly different from those considered under a Section 210 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.029" offset="624865">Under North Carolina law, we must first establish that the conduct directed towards Mrs. English was extreme and outrageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.151" offset="669273">As set forth quite thoroughly in the National Conference of State Legislators' brief, that is a very, very high standard, and only the most egregious situations will meet it.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.193" offset="717443">It requires considerably more than merely a retaliatory discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.635" offset="2511220">As this Court stated in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Congress has decided that the Federal Government, and not the states, should regulate the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.350" offset="5574129">It says that Silkwood is distinguishable because there was some legislative history indicating that Congress assumed that the persons who had been injured by exposure to radiation could pursue state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.210" offset="5633584">We agree with the First Circuit in the Norris v. Lumbermen's case that it's reasonable to suppose that Congress intended to supplement remedies to allow whistleblowers, as well as those injured by exposure to radiation, to pursue claims such as Petitioner's as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.957" offset="5716548">Let me make just one point with respect to... or further point with respect to conflict preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.027" offset="5744865">The Court should keep in mind that all three of the subparts of Section 210 that GE focuses on in... in that part of its brief are virtually identical to provisions in six other environmental statutes where state regulation is specifically contemplated by the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.607" offset="5827099">Thus, none of the three statutes... none of the three subparts, either individually or in combination, inherently conflicts with concurrent state regulation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1442.188" offset="5909437">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.140" offset="5921244">Contrary to what certainly Mr. Payne has said, and to a certain extent to what the Solicitor General's office has argued, this is a case about nuclear safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.829" offset="5956039">Section 210 of the Energy Reorganization Act is a statute that protects whistleblowers at nuclear facilities from retaliation by their employers for the purpose of ensuring that those facilities are operated consistent with public health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.653" offset="6011314">The enforcement mechanisms and procedures and remedies provided by Section 210 are an integral part of the field of safety that the Congress and this Court have long recognized to be an exclusive matter of Federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.913" offset="6064395">There is frankly no room for an alternative mechanism or procedure under state tort law for activity plainly covered under Section 210.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.585" offset="6099086">And, therefore, Petitioner's efforts to obtain additional relief in the form of a $1.3 million request for compensatory damages and a $2.3 billion request for punitive damages for a claim that she describes in her own complaint as one arising for reprisals with respect to her terms and conditions of employment for disclosing to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission noncompliance with law by General Electric, must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.402" offset="6202322">Because safety in the operation of a nuclear facility is directly implicated in this case, it must properly be analyzed under the field preemption doctrines that this Court applied in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and in Silkwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.960" offset="6248506">In those cases, the Court made absolutely clear that the Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.881" offset="6280271">Accordingly, the appropriate legal standard for analyzing the preemption in this case is the standard the Court announced initially in Rice and reaffirmed in PG&amp;E, and the question is whether the matter on the which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the Federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.742" offset="6347667">In order to evaluate that, then, we must begin by examining what it is that the Federal statute regulates in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.079" offset="6373058">Clearly, the Federal scheme regulates retaliation in the work place for reporting violations of safety requirements and threats that such retaliation... excuse me... and treats such retaliation as itself a serious safety concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.739" offset="6427706">What the Solicitor General ignores and what the Petitioner plainly ignores is the fact that these kinds of reprisals and retaliations have been recognized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since 1973 as a serious matter of safety vel non.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.784" offset="6495833">That is, that the fact of retaliation is itself a significant risk to the safety of the nuclear facility, and the NRC has explicit and specific authority not only to condition a license but to revoke a license solely as a consequence of an employer retaliating against an employee for actually presenting the NRC, or even the employer, with a concern with respect to safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.150" offset="6597293">Thus, this is not peripheral concern to the NRC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.185" offset="6609414">This is at the core of how the NRC ensures both technical safety in the facilities, management concern for safety in the facilities and assures that other employees are not deterred from bringing forth either to the NRC or to the employers the kinds of concerns about safety that they may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.848" offset="6688095">In addition, I think it's pretty clear by looking at the elements of Section 210 that it is... that it is designed ultimately to promote safety as its ultimate goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.804" offset="6723935">While it does, of course, provide specific remedies for the employees, its discrete elements also reflect that the ultimate purpose of this legislation is to ensure nuclear safety at every facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.929" offset="6772418">First, Section 210 does have a short limitations period, which is unquestionably going to encourage problems with safety to be reported quickly to the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.117" offset="6813169">Second, the provision directly contemplates a close interrelationship between the Secretary of Labor and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission so the Commission can act immediately upon being informed of a problem with the Secretary of Labor--</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.794" offset="6867922">A... there's not going to be much of a chance for retaliation unless somebody's already reported something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.916" offset="6904388">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.220" offset="6925600">The majority of circuits hold that a report to the employer which has not made it to the NRC is itself protected activity under Section 210 and, therefore, retaliation for those reports are compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.111" offset="6977113">The NRC would never have learned about that kind of conduct but--</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.700" offset="7011491">But the second part that Section 210 worries about as a safety concern is the fact of retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.787" offset="7035837">The fact, if proved, that Mrs. English was subjected to a course of harassment in the four months before her final layoff is a concern to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by itself and, therefore, you need to have Section 210 in order to promote that secondary but very vital safety concern embodied in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.486" offset="7126638">In addition, Section 210 provides full compensatory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.454" offset="7142521">There's an opportunity for back pay and reinstatement and compensation for injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.544" offset="7178883">No, because the value of knowing the nature of the remedy is that the legal test under Rice is, is this a matter in anyway regulated by the Federal Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.518" offset="7218798">If the Federal Government is providing you a specific remedy for the precise claims you bring as a matter of state law, then it's absolutely clear that the action on which the state is operating is precisely the same as the Federal Government, and if you are in an area of Federal preemption, then the state action must be set aside.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1803.773" offset="7355784">--in terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.408" offset="7362367">But, as this Court recognized in Silkwood, it felt at least some uneasiness with the inadequacy of the remedy that otherwise would exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.762" offset="7387758">To the extent that was any concern in Silkwood, it is clearly not a concern in this specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.183" offset="7413463">With respect to the last two elements of Section 210, it only permits the Secretary to obtain punitive damages, not the employee, and the reason for that is to insure against over-deterrence from employer's who have reason to respond to employee problems which themselves can be a serious safety concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.877" offset="7480232">And finally, Section 210 precludes relief when an employee deliberately violates Section 210(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.448" offset="7506459">And I think in that respect it's important to I think get a little more mileage out of Section 210(g) than perhaps we did in our brief because if you read 210(g), it accepts a remedy under Section 210(a) itself, which the Solicitor General pointed out in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.291" offset="7565913">But that suggests to me that Congress must have anticipated that Section 210(a) is the only appropriate relief for these kinds of work place problems because it is inconceivable that Congress would have said, no, we absolutely don't want you to get any recovery, including reinstatement, under Section 210(a), but we have no concerns whatsoever that you can go to state court on a wrongful discharge action and be placed right back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.608" offset="7667164">That's not the way Congress would have operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.977" offset="7676568">I think the limitations in Section 210(g) clearly reflect Congress' expectation that state law was not going to be available to an individual in Mrs. English's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.951" offset="7728500">Accordingly, the elements of Section 210 operate in tandem with the general preemption of the field of nuclear safety in a way that makes Mrs. English's claim unquestionably preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.258" offset="7777714">One other element that I suggest aids us with respect to the preemption question is the kind of analysis the Court employed in Schneidewind, where it said when you're dealing with occupation of the field problems what you need to worry about is whether there is an imminent threat of conflict between the way the state operates... the state law operates and the way the Federal concerns are being employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.106" offset="7861097">And in... and in this case, it's clear to me that if you give someone the opportunity to seek punitive damages, $2.3 billion, they are going to go to state court and they are not going to go to the Secretary of Labor, and a lot of impertant safety concerns are not going to be brought timely and promptly to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a way that is completely inconsistent with the way the scheme operates and completely inconsistent with notions of field preemption.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1958.775" offset="7975827">That is a calculation at the time, at least of the complaint, of 5 percent of the... I think gross... of the assets of GE, and it was a calculation the district court made in this case as to what... as to what was asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.118" offset="8037162">Notwithstanding in my mind the clear field preemption argument that applies in this case and ousts Mrs. English's claim, Petitioner and her amici offer three rationales for holding that the claim is not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.342" offset="8082093">First, Petitioner's primary answer in her reply brief is that Section 210(g)... excuse me... Section 210 is not itself a serious safety statute in the nuclear field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.400" offset="8130263">It may concern safety, but it is... it has antecedents in non-nuclear areas and, therefore, is beside the point for purposes of nuclear safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.756" offset="8163700">I submit to you that that is an incredible interpretation of a statute that is clearly part of the nuclear field that has been occupied by the Federal Government for the last 25 years and is an incredible assessment of how Congress operates when it enacts legislation, and that there's simply no basis for ignoring the safety concerns underlying Section 210 that exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.002" offset="8248754">Second, Petitioner and her amici argue, I think somewhat more strenuously, but with no greater effect, that field preemption doctrine in the nuclear area ought to be turned on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.025" offset="8288774">That is, that in this area alone... in the area of nuclear safety, which I submit is probably as important and one that requires a uniform Federal role as any area of law that I can imagine, the Federal Government comes to the Court and says in this one area what you need is a good purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.987" offset="8360663">That is, if you have a non-safety purpose in your state law for what you're doing, that you are free to walk through the Federal field that's otherwise preempted by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.426" offset="8398384">That is not what this Court held in Silkwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.960" offset="8408519">In fact, it is manifestly inconsistent with what the Court said in Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity, where it held it would be clearly impermissible for California to regulate the construction and operation of a nuclear facility for such regulation, even if enacted out of a non-safety concern, would nevertheless directly conflict with the NRC's authority over plant construction and operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.659" offset="8503396">The government turns the issue of state purpose on its head in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.527" offset="8518860">The purpose inquiry in that case was, if you're in an area ceded to the state and you have nevertheless a purpose to interfere with nuclear safety or you're operating for nuclear safety reasons, you are nevertheless preempted even though it's an area that Congress had ceded to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.989" offset="8592630">It in no way supports the argument that if you are in the area of operations of a nuclear facility that if your purpose happens to be not to interfere with nuclear safety in anyway, that that nevertheless is somehow exempt from field preemption analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.824" offset="10124033">Now, it may not be that the specific problem is safety related, but that kind of defiance is something the NRC needs to know for purposes of providing... of deciding whether or not this is somebody who should retain the privilege of a license to operate a nuclear facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.100" offset="10189130">Let me turn just quickly to the point that I think is terribly important in this case, and that is the scope of the preemption that General Electric urges in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.439" offset="10222462">We're not saying that all whistleblowing statutes preempt all state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.426" offset="10238449">Section 210 was enacted against a backdrop of a very specialized concern of nuclear safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.413" offset="10262377">The history of nuclear regulation in this country, as outlined in the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric case, makes that clear, and I think Congress knew that when it enacted this statute and had reached the conclusion that it did, that this is the appropriate way to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.138" offset="10313264">And that's... and so that if the Court holds that Section 210 is preemptive, to my mind that says nothing about preemption elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.619" offset="10519213">Everything else is... is covered because Section 210 not only deals with sort of technical and formal altering of the terms and conditions of employment, but, like Title VII in the Meritor analysis the Court employed a couple of terms ago, it also responds to the problems of general reprisals and an atmosphere of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.603" offset="10615135">And all of her claims fall squarely into that and all of those claims have been upheld as stating a claim under Section 210 by the Fourth Circuit with respect to Mrs. English herself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2769.651" offset="11219295">Well, there's no question that there might be a broader theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.519" offset="11230788">But I am content, frankly, to win on the theory that this is precisely the same thing that Section 210 provides for, and that, to me at least without any question in my mind, has to be part of the field preemption analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.494" offset="11278645">Whether it could go further is certainly there, and we make some arguments in the briefs that might reflect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.815" offset="11299961">But I think the basic... easiest basis for deciding this case is to say what is the relationship between the 210 recovery and what she seeks from state law, and there's a complete correspondence on that point, and what is leftover, to the extent that there is not a complete correspondence, is insufficient to permit her to go forward as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.942" offset="11372477">Let me conclude by what I started.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.659" offset="11379373">This is a case about nuclear safety, and it is clear to me that Petitioner's complaint predominantly intrudes into the area of exclusive Federal concern and what is left of her claim is simply insufficient as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.167" offset="11425348">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing her complaint should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.654" offset="11443321">If there are no further questions, I waive the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.260" offset="11485744">Without conceding it, I will say to you that even if you determine that Section 210 is a statute affecting nuclear safety, that that is its predominant role... even if you conclude that, we still win in the following ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.071" offset="11557006">This Court has spoken the premier field... premier examples of field preemption are the issues dealt with in Sections VII and VIII of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.398" offset="11606325">Yet this Court has addressed those issues and the issue of state court preemption in two very different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.885" offset="11632238">They have in fact... this Court has in fact applied the field preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.789" offset="11655853">Anything that the states do is preempted in the situation where the states have enacted a specific narrow state statute dealing with the specific matter of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.430" offset="11706426">Garner v. Teamsters way back when, a more recent version of that, Gould v. Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.017" offset="11732757">But then there are the NLRA cases where the state law at issue is a state law that has nothing to do with labor relations, is in fact one of general concerns of the state, such as intentional infliction of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.962" offset="11804542">When this Court has confronted a state law of general application, a state law that applies separate and apart from the field of labor relations, it has in fact applied the conflict preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.321" offset="11862011">I think, Justice Scalia, your point is well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.107" offset="11873192">We look at United Auto Workers v. Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.625" offset="11887193">We look at, in fact, Farmer v. The Carpenters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.648" offset="11919272">There the state law, as I recall it, did not deal just with labor relations and yet we held it preempted.</text>
