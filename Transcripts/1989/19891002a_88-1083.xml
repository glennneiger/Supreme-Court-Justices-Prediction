            <text syncTime="1023.637" offset="4245168">In, in... in Abramson this Court said, in, in construing this exact compiled-for-law-enforcement-purposes provision, said it is critical that the compiled-for-law-enforcement requirement be construed to avoid the release of information that would produce the undesirable result specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.079" offset="4310892">And... in other words, the Court said that the exemption has to be construed in a coherent manner, so that, so that information the Congress was especially concerned about wouldn't fall between the cracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.537" offset="4356763">And I think it is significant in this regard that Congress in 1986, after Abramson, amended Exemption 7(A) and, and... to provide not simply that records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but also information compiled for law enforcement purposes, could be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.617" offset="4424995">And it was the absence of the word information that was of significance to the dissenters in Abramson because the Act at that point only referred to records.</text>

Abramson and says that these amendments which were intended to ease the burden of law enforcement agencies were</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.963" offset="4518409">"intended to ensure that sensitive law enforcement information is protected under Exemption 7 regardless of the particular format or record in which... in which the record is maintained. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.415" offset="7132221">I would like to emphasize, as I just have, that there is only one affidavit on the facts in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.022" offset="7174644">And it appears on page 60 and 61 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.136" offset="7195124">It's an affidavit submitted by an Assistant United States Attorney, named Sean O'Shea, who was the grand jury attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.312" offset="7231800">And it states all the facts that were in this record when the District Court made its decision and when the Court of Appeals made its decision, with one qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.040" offset="7270775">There were a number of exhibits attached to the government's answer to the complaint, which are also in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.635" offset="7297106">And all that he says about the facts is that the documents in this case were removed from the DCAA by the FBI for the purpose of presenting them to a grand jury, that the documents were compiled by the DCAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.138" offset="7379131">There is no statement in this affidavit or in any subsequent affidavit that they were ever compiled by the FBI or recompiled by the FBI, or that they were compiled by the DCAA for any law enforcement purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.280" offset="7443705">It is clear from the affidavit that they were compiled in the normal routine of the agency's performance of its oversight functions, in this case, reviewing contractor charging practices under government defense contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.191" offset="7507340">There is no suggestion in this affidavit or in any other affidavit that the DCAA was cooperating in a law enforcement investigation with the FBI at any time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.942" offset="7690301">The first response to the request to the DCAA for the documents is give us more time to locate them; they are very old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.688" offset="7721335">Obviously, they were not being used for any law enforcement purpose at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.207" offset="7751428">They were sitting in the dead files of the DCAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.790" offset="7765743">There is no suggestion any place in this record that at any time after they were retrieved from dead storage and withheld from the requestor, the corporation, that they assumed a law enforcement purposes in the DCAA's possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.113" offset="7843065">What the DCAA said when they denied production of the documents was the FBI, in fact an Assistant United States Attorney, whom they designate by name, Mr. Milton, has directed us to withhold these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.845" offset="7913909">Therefore, we can't give them to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.118" offset="7923000">And in a later... and, and there is in the record the letter from the DCAA to the same Assistant U.S. Attorney, in which they say to the U.S. Attorney, since you have now directed us to withhold these documents and you have possession of them, will you handle this appeal that the corporation is filing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.307" offset="8031774">This was the FBI saying to the DCAA, don't comply with this FOIA request.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.909" offset="12286180">It has no significance on the record in this case as the construction of these key words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.334" offset="12311885">We point out in our brief that the government demeans Professor Howe's compilation of the Holmes-Laski Letters in his famous work by comparing it to what the FBI did in this case when it removed custody of these documents from the DCAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.637" offset="12393178">But let us, let us assume for a moment that instead of publishing this historic work, what Professor Howe did was this: He learned that someone else was on the trail of Justice Holmes' letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.446" offset="12452319">So first, he directed Justice Holmes not to disclose them to someone else or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.384" offset="12484084">And then he appeared in Justice Holmes' chambers and removed the letters from Justice Holmes so that no member of the public could thereafter have access to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.371" offset="12536015">We might call such high-handed conduct by many names, but I don't think any of them would be compilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.288" offset="12575722">Without sugarcoating it, that is just what the FBI did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.972" offset="12598500">By doing that, they thwarted the administrative process in this... in all FOIA cases, and they did it without any of the justifications in an executive order, such as apply to Exemption 1 cases, which specifically authorize that kind of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.765" offset="12669658">After an FOIA request is filed, by the explicit terms of the executive order, a document may be classified or reclassified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.030" offset="12702677">That is not the case with respect to any of the other exemptions, and the fact that they had to say in an executive order documents can be classified or reclassified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.207" offset="12743428">This... there is nothing about compiling or recompiling in Exemption 7 means that... if they had just said classified, they would not have assumed that classify meant classified or reclassified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.372" offset="12788045">You wouldn't have to use both words if the government's interpretation of Exemption 7 have merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.277" offset="12811660">If I may borrow a phrase from the government's Reply Brief, it would trivialize Exemption 7's threshold test, to equate the conduct in this case with the compilation of information or records for law enforcement purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.369" offset="12880100">Despite the focus on semantics and grammar in briefs, the argument between the corporation and the government is not just over words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.067" offset="12926807">What the government really is concerned about is the ability of the subject... of a subject of an investigation to obtain any information, any evidence that might be useful to the subject of the investigation which he could not obtain prior to or unless he is indicted under the federal rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.132" offset="13019072">It's because of those provisions in Exemption 7 that the President vetoed the 1974 bill, that the Attorney General testified, strenuously opposed it, and the FBI was apoplectic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.532" offset="13084691">Prosecutors much prefer a system under which they can carry on their investigations with two, three or, in this case, over four years, this investigation, we are told, has been in progress, while the subjects are on standby, and then make whatever disclosures the federal rules permit in the 70 days between arraignment and trial, and as close to trial as they can make it in any particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.152" offset="13199212">As North v. Walsh, which we discussed in our supplemental brief, points out, the Department of Justice has, in fact, again proposed an amendment which would prohibit use of the FOIA as a discovery device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.051" offset="13262742">But Congress has not adopted that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.923" offset="13278311">And what it adopted, over the strenuous objections of the Department of Justice in 1974, which is language which contains no such limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.172" offset="13319271">Having failed before Congress, the government would like an interpretation of Exemption 7's threshold requirement from this Court that would nullify its significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.107" offset="13358977">But to prevail in this case the government must stretch the facts beyond recognition, write its own dictionaries and rules of grammar, and convince the Court to rewrite the language of the statute and its legislative history, since, in our view, there is also no record in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.807" offset="13481857">There are several points I'd like to bring to the... to the Court's attention in, in the discussion that is focused on the word compiled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.314" offset="13511846">I think it is important to understand what Congress was driving at and what it... what the responsible agencies understood Congress to be driving at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.768" offset="13541625">Because, as this Court said in Abramson, Exemption 7 is, is an exemption of substance and not one of technicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.243" offset="13571509">The first... the first thing I want to point out is a passage from the Attorney General's memorandum, page 6 of the Attorney General's memorandum on the 1974 amendments to FOIA, which is discussed in the District Court's opinion in Hatcher, which is discussed in the briefs, and it's the same page of the Attorney General's memorandum that was discussed by this Court in footnote 5 of Abramson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.895" offset="13646115">And there the Court says... or there the Attorney General, in explaining the recently enacted... amendments, states that although ordinarily records used in monitoring agencies would not... or activities, would not be covered by Exemption 7, it then continues to say except where the purpose for which the records are held and used by the agency becomes substantially violation oriented, i.e., becomes refocused on preventing, discovering or applying sanctions against non-compliance with federal statutes or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.695" offset="13773384">So here we have a contemporaneous construction of the statute by the Attorney General in a memorandum that this Court has relied upon and agencies have relied on ever since, saying that the status of records, once they become refocused on a... on an exemption, is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.496" offset="13828554">The second thing is, in the legislative history Senator Philip Hart of Michigan, who was the sponsor of the amendment, described the threshold in the same sort of pragmatic terms in the same passage, another portion of which the Court discussed in Robbins Tire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.695" offset="13885397">The... Senator Hart said that the amendment is broadly written, but he wanted to point out that the material cannot be exempt merely because it can be categorized, he used that word, as an investigatory file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.573" offset="13928864">You also have to prove one of the six harms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.026" offset="13942657">But he did use the word categorized, which is exactly the concept that we are trying to... explain is what the... what the amendment refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.431" offset="13976303">And then he says in broad terms, the amendment... the exemption would apply whenever the government's case in court, a concrete prospective law enforcement proceeding, would be harmed by the premature release of evidence or information not in the possession of known or--</text>
