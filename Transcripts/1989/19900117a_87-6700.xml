            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138708">We'll hear argument now in No. 87-6700, John Henry Selvage v. James A. Lynaugh.</text>

            <text syncTime="10.558" offset="180922">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.441" offset="200461">As in the case of Johnny Paul Penry, the jury that sentenced John Selvage to death did so without being able to consider or give effect to the mitigating circumstances he proffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.079" offset="250930">Unlike Penry's lawyers, however, John Selvage's lawyers did not object to this constitutional defect in his sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.127" offset="291159">As a result, when the pre-Penry claims in both of these cases got to the court of criminal appeals in Texas, in the Penry case the court denied the claim on the merits, and in Mr. Selvage's case the court denied the claim on the basis of the procedural default at trial, the failure to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.988" offset="366600">The question before the Court today is whether the court of criminal appeals' ruling should prevent the Federal habeas courts from deciding the merits of Mr. Selvage's Penry claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.285" offset="415815">When this question was first presented to this Court in Mr. Selvage's cert. petition which was filed back in March of 1988, no issue was raised concerning the adequacy of the state procedural ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.246" offset="471612">Since that time, however... as a matter of fact, 15 months after that time... when this Court announced its decision in Penry at the end of June 1989, and as a result of the Penry decision, there is now no state ground barring review of the merits of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.858" offset="546114">Accordingly, in the time since the question was first presented in our cert. petition to the Court, a new threshold question has arisen: whether the default ruling in the state courts is now based on an adequate state ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.954" offset="702430">Your Honor, I think that the Court is in a position, because of the clarity of Texas law and because of the posture in which this case is in... we are here on a Federal habeas proceeding with the merits not having been reached because of the default ruling... this Court certainly has the power, and, indeed, has usually given itself the obligation to determine whether the procedural ruling is an adequate state ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.493" offset="808592">The Court could look at state law, determine... and we would ask that the Court do this... that the ruling is no longer an adequate state ground and hold that there is no default which bars consideration of claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.490" offset="948608">The procedural rules in Texas at the time that the Penry case was decided, as a result of those rules excused the procedural default at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.120" offset="1003152">For that reason, the... the ruling of the Federal courts, which was based on that default, is now no longer, we submit, an adequate ruling because there is no default.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.510" offset="1048710">So, as a matter of Federal habeas procedure, we are here on a Federal habeas petition on a defaulted claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.772" offset="1077758">There is certainly a Federal interest in deciding whether there is still a viable state ground for this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.949" offset="1114434">If not... and we submit this Court is empowered and certainly because of the State of Texas law ought to go ahead and decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.275" offset="1143795">If there is no default, then the merits ought to be determined in the Federal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.624" offset="1989118">Let me describe that procedural rule for a moment, if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.807" offset="2009911">It is probably most often quoted from a case called Ex parte Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.389" offset="2040213">The Court has formulated the rule in Chambers as follows, and I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.983" offset="2062574">"A defendant has not waived his right to assert a constitutional violation by failing to object at trial if at the time of his trial the right had not been recognized. "</text>
            <text syncTime="492.683" offset="2109386">Now, that rule has been applied according to, we submit, four parameters.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.755" offset="2133627">First of all, the Court has made plain that it applies if a supervening subsequent decision of this Court recognizes a claim which at the time of trial would have been novel... novel in the sense of Reed v. Ross... that the constitutional theories and principles were simply not available to put the claim together.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.409" offset="2212308">That is not our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.779" offset="2217741">The second parameter where Chambers forgives a prior default is that if the claim is, as the state courts put it, futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.717" offset="2265493">And what the state courts in Texas mean by futile is that the tools were there to make the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.661" offset="2289317">It had been made on all the constitutional grounds to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and categorically rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.166" offset="2315335">At that point Texas law does not require that a defendant continue raising claims that it has categorically rejected with no new theory available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.932" offset="10190417">Mr. Selvage asserts that cause exists for his procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.057" offset="10210897">As this Court noted... as some of the questions that I've heard noted, Lockett v. Ohio clearly predated Mr. Penry... or, Mr. Selvage's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.018" offset="10278711">This Court's opinion in Penry dictates the result on... as far as whether there is novelty for his procedural bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.355" offset="10320089">Clearly, a claim that is dictated by precedent that exists prior to the trial, a person can never claim novelty as an exception to the procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.291" offset="10355825">Selvage asserts that his default involves a claim of basic trial process... pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.083" offset="10418937">Excuse me, I'd like to back up for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.806" offset="10425833">The concept of futility... and this is nothing more than futility... has been firmly established that that cannot constitute cause for a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.415" offset="10488318">It was established in Engle; it was reaffirmed in Smith v. Murray.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.189" offset="10507439">It was... and particularly in Smith v. Murray.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.352" offset="10520083">I believe that that is probably more on point than would be even Engle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.046" offset="10538891">In Smith v. Murray, it was a constitutional claim that was presented to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.601" offset="10565013">And that was whether there was a violation... or the defaulting claim was one of whether there was an Estelle v. Smith error for... in having the psychiatrist testify in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.901" offset="10618303">In that case, specifically, the... this Court found that that claim had been percolating and that even though the state court... even though counsel could reasonably have concluded that the state court would never have granted him relief, the fact remains that the tools were available for him to formulate a constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.815" offset="10709941">There simply is no difference in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.299" offset="10719867">In this case, for instance, Mr. Selvage suggests that the state rule foreclosed consideration of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.816" offset="10765947">If one looks at the existence of the state... of the state law at the time, there could be nothing further than the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.240" offset="10795622">The claim... most of the cases that Mr. Selvage cites involve not as applied constitutional challenge but, rather, facial challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.446" offset="10840448">In each of the cases, even though they state that mitigating evidence couldn't be considered, it was in the abstract, stating that because the concepts of deliberate... the "deliberately" was not defined, for instance; therefore, it was somehow... somehow might have allowed in the abstract the... that mitigating evidence could not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.824" offset="10941908">In... in none of those cases did... did the Petitioner... or did the Appellant state that he presented mitigating evidence which could not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.052" offset="10982868">As I understand the difference between "as applied" and "facial challenges", is a person... especially in the Penry context, it would be the idea that I have mitigating evidence; it cannot be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.312" offset="11027903">Certainly, none of those cases stand for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.713" offset="11041487">The one case that does stand for the proposition is Quinones v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.915" offset="11058310">Quinones was decided one month prior to Selvage's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.748" offset="11073670">Quinones had not sought, and this Court had not ruled on certiorari by the time Selvage's trial resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.763" offset="11105748">Even if the Court were to somehow adopt any concept of foreclosure one case subsequent to Lockett... and no determination of certiorari by this Court could hardly constitute foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.934" offset="11166352">This Court has... turning to the question of whether there is a fundamental miscarriage of justice... this Court has recognized that principles of finality underlying the procedural default obviously have to give way where such fundamental miscarriages have resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.735" offset="11289546">The case of Carrier... Murray v. Carrier first addressed the question of what constituted a fundamental miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.482" offset="11328625">In previous cases, both in Engle... in Engle and in fact Carrier, they rejected the concept that there would be a fundamental miscarriage of justice... this Court rejected the concept that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would constitute an undermining of the fact... reliability of the fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.058" offset="11426845">It rejected the concept that if... that the error impacted on fundamental... the fundamental fairness of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.555" offset="11456834">This Court stated that that was nothing more than the... a restatement of the prejudice prong of Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.521" offset="11492778">The one thread that runs through the... this Court's jurisprudence in regard to the... in regard to what a fundamental miscarriage of justice is, is that whatever happens, a fundamental miscarriage of justice must be a far narrower focus than whatever would constitute cause under... under Wainwright v. Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.850" offset="11598104">To have any... any larger focus than that, or the same focus, would in fact undermine the cause and prejudice standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.986" offset="11626630">Therefore, this Court adopted the concept that there would be fundamental miscarriage of justice only in the event that a defendant could show that the error probably resulted in the conviction of a person who was actually innocent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.197" offset="11731433">And this Court has... this Court has, of course, encountered that problem, has expressed a... a... a problem with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.020" offset="11754734">How to... how to translate actual innocence into the concept... into the concept of capital sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.846" offset="11778035">The... the... this Court was undoubtedly... undoubtedly aware of the problem that resulted from the fact that we have used the concepts of guilt and innocence and translated it, which is a... a question of historical fact... and translated those into the concept of a largely... of a profoundly moral question of whether somebody should... should live or should die.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.415" offset="11892347">Now, this Court has, of course, decided that certain classes of persons are not eligible for a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.771" offset="11937696">Persons who are under the age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.764" offset="11945741">Persons who are... persons who would fit within the Enmund or Tison rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.970" offset="11974581">Those people are... and... and... those people are not eligible for sentence and obviously a defendant who... those would be historical facts that a court could conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.367" offset="12012092">So if, of course, Penry, alleged Penry error resulted in the exclusion of evidence that would establish that, we could of course demonstrate that a person was actually innocent or the death sentence in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.439" offset="12076458">Amicus for the state suggest that this Court should go no further and just avoid entering the subjective morass of morality which would inevitably result from this Court adopting, particularly the rule of that Mr. Selvage suggests, any concept that somehow he deserves... that a Federal court, years after the fact, would state that he deserves the death penalty, number one, in my opinion, it would... would do nothing more than restate what the prejudice prong of... of Strickland v. Washington is since in effect of assistance of counsel is in fact a standard for cause to excuse a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.590" offset="12273004">To repeat nothing more than the prejudice standard of Strickland would in fact negate in effect of assistance of counsel as cause for a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.836" offset="12309993">Since this Court obviously intends... or, certainly appears to want to have a far narrower focus than that which constitutes cause, it necessarily has to be a greater... a narrower inquiry than whether a person deserves a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.619" offset="12377180">Moreover, to say that he... to have a habeas court ten... in this case, ten years later, decide what... whether a person deserves a death sentence is... is nothing more than to ask for de novo fact-finding on a moral question when the Court has neither heard the evidence, viewed the evidence, viewed the demeanor of the witnessed who testified; and, in fact, would amount to... would amount to nothing more than a habeas court imposing its moral judgment on... on fact-finders who very well may never have possessed the identical moral judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.463" offset="12516465">Thus, the state has suggested a standard which would... which would, I think, narrow the discretion... so narrow the discretion of the... of the habeas court reviewing for a fundamental miscarriage of justice and actual innocence of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.857" offset="12602042">And that would be to revise the Jackson v. Virginia standard so that... to force the habeas court to look through the eyes of a rational juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.372" offset="12636106">If the jury were properly instructed, if it were presented with the evidence, would that jury... would a jury... or could a habeas court conclude that no rational juror would have reached the same result, that being a death sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.053" offset="12698904">We fell that adopting that standard, if a standard is to be adopted at all... and I'm... I... we agree entirely with amicus that we should probably stop at the... whether they fit within an excluded class of the death penalty... but if this Court is to adopt a standard, it must take pains to avoid the... the idea of imposing moral judgment years after the fact... upon... upon the proper... the proper vehicle... the proper fact-finders which would be, of course, the jury or a judge in a--</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.585" offset="12832964">To adopt Mr. Selvage's rule, the Court would do... pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.808" offset="12905898">In... I would wish to close at this point and I would ask the Court to recall that it has taken great strides to ensure the reliability... or assure... ensure the preeminence of a trial and the direct appeal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.330" offset="13039959">It's commenced with Wainwright v. Sykes, it concluded at this point in Teague v. Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.697" offset="13069425">To adopt... to adopt Selvage's proposal as to what constitutes cause would be nothing more than to allow Selvage to do what Penry could not do, and that would be a de facto overruling or Jurek v. Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.757" offset="13137657">To adopt his concept of actual innocence would do nothing more than ask... than render a trial as a preliminary hearing, at which... a preliminary hearing to be reviewed years later de novo by a Federal habeas judge who neither heard nor viewed the evidence and would be imposing his moral judgment upon the proper fact-finders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.463" offset="13248520">If the Court has no further questions, we ask that the matter be affirmed and the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</text>
