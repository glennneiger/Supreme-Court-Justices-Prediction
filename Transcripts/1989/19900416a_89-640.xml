            <text syncTime="10.272" offset="193239">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.224" offset="200972">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.212" offset="225004">That court held that Respondent had standing to challenge hundreds of Bureau of Land Management land orders entered over the course of several years affecting 180 million acres of public lands in 17 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.952" offset="279966">The court concluded that a single affidavit of one of Respondent's members, Peggy Kay Peterson, was sufficient to confer that standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.541" offset="314239">In her affidavit Ms. Peterson claimed that she used Federal lands in the vicinity of the South Pass/Green Mountain area of Wyoming, and she claimed that she was injured by a BLM decision to open that area to the staking of mining claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.587" offset="378500">The district court found that the area in question covered some 2 million acres, of which only 6,000 acres had ever been closed to mining, and of those 6,000 the BLM decision only opened 4,500 to the staking of mining claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.446" offset="445896">The court noted that Peterson's affidavit said nothing about using the 4,500 affected acres and, therefore, concluded that she had shown no injury and that Respondent, therefore, had no standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="89.224" offset="509008">That claim was in the Greenwalt declaration, one of the other of the three original affidavits that were submitted by Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.862" offset="539623">The claim there was that the organization had standing in its own right, without regard to any injury to its particular members.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.352" offset="577553">And the district court, we believe, correctly concluded that that declaration, the Greenwalt declaration, was completely conclusory and devoid of specific facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.125" offset="616632">But more important, it's really just Sierra Club against Morton all over again.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.462" offset="642023">With respect, Your Honor, no, it did not reach the Greenwalt declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.933" offset="659891">It didn't pass on that, choosing to rest its decision entirely on the Peterson affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.003" offset="684133">The district court, however, did address the Greenwalt declaration and found it, as I've indicated, conclusory and devoid of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.257" offset="713181">It is, as I've mentioned, the Sierra Club case all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.459" offset="730004">In fact, it's... it's helpful to compare the allegation of standing in the Sierra Club case with that in the Greenwalt declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.048" offset="756335">They're really quite similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.431" offset="761873">Each of them says our organization has experience and expertise in conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.468" offset="782039">We're vitally interested in this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.404" offset="789772">In the Sierra Club case the affidavit said we responsibly serve and represent our members.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.606" offset="810565">In the Greenwalt declaration, Ms. Greenwalt claimed that the organization needed information and public participation in order to represent their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.312" offset="845360">But this court in the Morton case said that that sort of interest was insufficient to confer standing because it was in no way distinct from the interest any citizen could claim coming in the courthouse and saying I'm interested in this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.637" offset="902621">Turning back to the Peterson affidavit, what Ms. Peterson claimed was that she used land in the vicinity of this 2 million acre parcel, the South Pass/Green Mountain area of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.731" offset="955075">The District... the D.C. Circuit on appeal presumed that she meant to say something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.849" offset="975555">It presumed that she meant to say she used the 4,500 affected acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.587" offset="994467">The reasoning was that she claimed that she was injured, claimed that she had standing, and she would only be injured and only have standing if she used the 4,500 acres and, therefore, she must have meant to say that she used those 4,500 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.612" offset="1058519">This is exactly backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.798" offset="1067297">Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.833" offset="1079417">The presumption is that they are without jurisdiction, and the plaintiff must affirmatively prove that he has standing to invoke the power of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.356" offset="1113586">The court of appeals presumed Peterson meant to say she used the 4,500 acres because otherwise she wouldn't have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.260" offset="1141171">But what Peterson said is that she was in the vicinity of this 2 million acre area, not even within the 2 million acres, just in the vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.616" offset="1174608">Even assuming we can place Peterson somewhere within the 2 million acres, the court of appeals had no basis for drastically narrowing the focus of her allegations on the 0.225 percent of that area that was the only area affected by the challenged decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.153" offset="1312743">Well, I know that, but is it anything more than just a geographical designation selected by the... by Ms. Peterson?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="298.943" stopTime="476.158">
            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="298.943" offset="1347852">Yes, Your Honor, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.145" offset="1352658">It is the term that the... the Bureau used in the land use planning process.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.030" offset="1372198">I refer the court to page 132 of the Joint Appendix, the affidavit of Jack Kelly, who's the administrator of the area, in which he refers to the South Pass/Green Mountain area as consisting of these... these 2 million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.022" offset="1424234">By any token, it is a vast expanse.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.808" offset="1435310">South Pass is some 55 miles from Green Mountain.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.860" offset="1451610">So, even taking the allegation as narrowly as possible on its face, what she's referring to is essentially the equivalent of being in the vicinity of the Baltimore-Washington area.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.068" offset="1492361">And it's important to remember that there's never been any mystery about where these 4,500 acres are.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.453" offset="1513886">This isn't a case where she alleged a vast area because she didn't know where the government was affecting the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.875" offset="1539591">Two years before her affidavit was filed the Bureau published in the Federal Register a very exact designation of the parcels comprising the 4,500 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.064" offset="1576371">Respondent knew this.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.347" offset="1581491">It cited the Federal Register notice in its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.516" offset="1594239">Therefore, if we're going to indulge in presumptions, the more reasonable presumption would be that if Peterson or any other of Respondent's members could have alleged that they used those particular 4,500 acres, they would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.609" offset="1646588">But neither Peterson nor anyone else did.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.661" offset="1658813">Now, the court of appeals compounded its error many times over when it ruled that the Peterson affidavit conferred standing on Respondent to challenge not only the South Pass/Green Mountain order, but hundreds of other BLM orders affecting another 178 million acres of public lands throughout the West... this, despite the fact that the Peterson affidavit said nothing beyond the confines of South Pass and Green Mountain.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.395" offset="1769677">Respondent's argument on this score is that it's complaining about a program, that BLM has a program to review land classifications and land withdrawals.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.936" offset="1811891">In a certain sense this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.555" offset="1822340">Such review is a very big part of what the Bureau of Land Management does.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.674" offset="1838849">But saying they have a program to review land use classifications is like saying that NASA has a program to explore space or the Department of Justice has a program to prosecute criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.564" offset="1882422">Of course they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.264" offset="1885138">That's what the agency does.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.183" offset="1892871">But it's beside the point so far as standing is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.801" offset="1907290">The Respondent relies for its standing on section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.205" offset="1928919">That provision gives a right to judicial review to a person who is aggrieved by final agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.293" offset="1961311">The Respondent cannot be aggrieved by the sort of program it complains about.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.680" offset="1982836">It may not like the way the BLM is going about its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.215" offset="1996942">It may even think that the BLM is violating the law in the way it goes about its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.969" offset="2015959">But until that program or policy culminates in a final agency action, Respondent is not aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.939" offset="2043858">The final agency actions in this case are the land orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.201" offset="2928887">To cite just one example, 31 of the challenged land orders govern some 5 million acres of land in Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.767" offset="3739205">As the Court noted in Allen against Wright, the standing focuses on whether the particular plaintiff can raise the particular claims asserted.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.299" offset="3833351">Now the court of appeals' decision in this regard giving the Federation nationwide standing based on one injury to a particular plaintiff under one land order raises the most serious separation of powers concerns because it aggregates in the district court all of the Bureau of Land Management orders since 1981, even though before that district court is one plaintiff complaining of one order.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.919" offset="3947767">Those types of separation of powers concerns are precisely what the standing doctrine is designed to avoid.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.200" offset="4048913">If the Court disagrees with us on those and if, in fact, the supplemental affidavits establish standing, it would only be to the limited parcels, the limited orders mentioned in those affidavits.</text>
