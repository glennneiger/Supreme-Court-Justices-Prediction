            <text syncTime="54.301" offset="367489">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.170" offset="378983">Unlike the first case before you this morning, this one does not involve the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="399567">It involves rules of procedure for civil cases in the United States district courts and the rules governing appeals in the United States courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.762" offset="441363">And lawyers arguing about such rules face the unique task of arguing to you about what you probably meant, must have meant, when you considered rules submitted to you by the advisory committee, the standing committee, the judicial conference, and you approved them for submission to the Congress and they were in fact effective upon the completion of the rules enabling act process.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.247" offset="543345">Although not rising to the level of constitutional issues, we submit that the three questions before you this morning may have an enormous impact on the availability of legal services to clients throughout this country who bring to lawyers every day cases and ask them to carry those cases to court and the lawyers are confronted with the responsibility of doing justice to the clients and meeting their duties to the court, particularly duties imposed now by the current state of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.050" offset="674480">The briefs of the parties in this case, as well as the briefs of the amici curiae, have addressed the facts at some length and I choose not to do that this morning unless the Court wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.757" offset="709379">I would like to spend a moment or two on the facts because they lay the groundwork for the three issues that I would like to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.310" offset="739577">Briefly, the facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.929" offset="750026">The litigation that resulted in sanctions began as a suit on a contract brought by a subsidiary of the Hartmarx Company against a client of Petitioner... Petitioner's law firm Cooter &amp; Gell.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.289" offset="803420">This suit was met with a counterclaim, a Robinson-Patman counterclaim, and thus began the litigation that ended up in this Court with the sanctions issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.461" offset="840201">As the investigation into the counterclaim took place and facts were gathered, Petitioner discovered what it believed to be serious antitrust violations, broad Robinson-Patman violations in a number of cities around the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.137" offset="898819">And allegations by its client, a clothing company, distributor of men's clothing that had done business at various locations since 1969 in Washington, D.C., that Hartmarx Company and two of its principle subsidiaries had engaged not only in Robinson-Patman violations, but it engaged in price fixing that was supported by an exclusive dealer arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.845" offset="1049703">That the Petitioner represented to the district court that its investigation was based upon allegations made by its client.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.083" offset="1082617">And if I might elaborate, the... the... on that little bit because the record in this case is not the record that I would like to have before you, and I--</text>

            <text syncTime="244.507" offset="1128383">--It is the record we must deal with and... and the reason for that is Rule 11 had just taken effect in its revised form in August of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.747" offset="1165268">The complaint in this case, the class action complaint which gave rise to sanctions, was filed barely three months thereafter and this was one of the early sanctions cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.138" offset="1210826">When the complaint was filed in this case, it was met with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and almost immediately thereafter a request for sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.028" offset="1250428">Almost immediately after the request for sanctions was filed, Mr. Chief Justice... gets to the point about who made the allegations... request was made by the defendant in the case to depose one of the principals, the leading shareholder and the president of the client company.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.372" offset="1315838">Petitioner opposed the deposition at that time, which was focused only on Rule 11, because the district court hadn't addressed the 12(b)(6) motion, hadn't considered the merits, and enormous clients... enormous questions of attorney/client privilege and the difficulty of dealing with privilege questions and Rule 11 issues at a time when this case was in its infancy and there was the previously filed Robinson-Patman claim pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.153" offset="1410924">And they opposed the deposition and the district court ordered that the deposition take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.105" offset="1426702">And it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.039" offset="1430463">During the course of that deposition, which is in the Joint Appendix before this Court, this Court can see that counsel essentially instructed its... the principal of its client not to answer any questions with respect to what the client said to the law firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.132" offset="1486783">Instead, Petitioner offered to make available any member or the law firm to explain the origins of the complaint, the information that was relied upon, anything else, without waiving the attorney/client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.007" offset="1530356">Well, if I might jump ahead in the law for a moment, if we had the benefit of all the cases, if we had... had had in 1984... in 1983 the benefit of all the cases decided in the next four or five years, one could say, well, didn't they know that procedures would be developed whereby in camera you could go before the district court and make certain representations that wouldn't be disclosed, that there wouldn't be a waiver of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.586" offset="1616664">And there are ways to deal with attorney/client privilege problems that might have enabled the deposition to take place, information to be provided to the judge, without waiver of the privilege and the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.561" offset="1664521">With the benefit of what came afterwards, it might have been possible to do things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.882" offset="1681866">But this was early 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.648" offset="1688867">It was early in Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.334" offset="1695659">And, in fact, the record indicates that the client basically said, I relied on the law firm and was instructed not to answer any questions about what the client in fact told the law firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.605" offset="1736723">The Petitioner represented to the district court and represented to the court of appeals, and represents to this Court, that its investigation was at all times based upon the information and belief provided by this experienced client, a client that had been in the men's clothing business for 14 years prior to the filing of the complaint, that it had experience in the industry and that one of the difficulties with this record was the difficulty of dealing with attorney/client privilege questions and an early sanctions motion... early in the case... before the merits were even to be addressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.684" offset="2009023">If the Court decides that a higher standard should have been used than the court of appeals, the Court would, under the question granted, be justified in remanding this case for further consideration by the court of appeals on whether--</text>

            <text syncTime="618.767" offset="2625409">Our position is that with respect to criminal contempt, 18 U.S.C. 401, as well as 28 U.S.C. 1927, the penalty provision for lawyers who vexatiously multiply proceedings, that the court's power to impose and to consider contempt and penalties on the lawyer under that statute are not... are not ended when a Rule 41(a)(i) dismissal is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.067" offset="2726555">And the reason is that the Congress has provided by statute for very particularized sanctions for the most egregious forms of behavior and that prior to the amendment in 1983 of Rule 11 there was no indication that contempt or other sanctions for misbehavior, particular affront to the court, couldn't be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.731" offset="2805236">What we have today, and the reason this case we submit is different than the issues presented from those statutory provisions, particularly contempt, is that we have your rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.270" offset="2847345">We have your Rule 11, your Rule 41, and a construction of those rules and what you intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.324" offset="2871587">And your rules provide two exceptions to Rule 41... 41(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="685.109" offset="2890708">They provide that that rule will be subject to 23(e), the class action rule which requires the judge consider notice to the class before the dismissal becomes final, and 66, the receiver's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.084" offset="2930623">No one suggested when... in 1983 when the rule was amended, that there ought to be an additional exception for Rule 11.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.882" offset="3337820">The arguments that Respondents make to the Court... now, the Court, of course, can accept less of this argument... the arguments that Respondents make is that indeed Rule 11 does give the federal district court the power to dismiss the case with prejudice as a sanction, notwithstanding Rule 41 saying dismissal will be without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.827" offset="3405634">They are... and they are in effect forced to that position because all of the cases decided in the lower court say that the district judge has essentially a whole array of sanctions, whatever the district judge deems appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.484" offset="3452237">And their argument is that that is... you can square that reading of Rule 11 with Rule 41 by simply saying that the with prejudice is a penalty imposed because of a Rule 11 violation and that somehow that doesn't interfere with Rule 41's guarantee to the client that dismissal would be without prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.757" offset="3697370">One of the things that Rule 11 does, at least if our argument is accepted and the law, at least as it's developing now, is that there are at least minimum procedural requirements that must be employed before any sanctions are imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.600" offset="3748674">One of those requirements is, at least in some instances where the sanction is severe, that there be fact-finding by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.253" offset="3775319">And those facts may very well give rise to collateral estoppel fact unless there is an appeal and unless the appeal is... produces a... an overturning of the lower court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.894" offset="3821921">What happens on Rule 11 is there are no sanctions in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.930" offset="3838013">There are sanctions because the district judge makes a decision that something was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.000" offset="3854313">And if the district judge decides that something was wrong has to do with the merits of the case, we now have a situation in which 41 says you can dismiss without prejudice, but Rule 11's dismissal may in fact be, as a practical matter, prejudicial not only in the sense of economically prejudicial but prejudicial in the very legal sense of making it more difficult, if not impossible, to bring a subsequent suite based on those same facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.912" offset="5665957">That offends almost everyone's basic sense of what seems right, at least at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.299" offset="5687482">But there is no Rule 11 case... there's no Rule 11 case that doesn't raise this question, which is how are we going to know whether or not there was an inadequacy unless we start the procedural machine rolling to make the Rule 11 determinations?</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.742" offset="5745265">And our submission is Rule 41 has always served a very valid and important purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.883" offset="6913879">Now, Mr. Chief Justice, no one is suggesting that the defendant should be obligated to go through every line of a complaint and to review it for all the law and all the little... you know, intricacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.572" offset="6948570">But where it's one essential fact and they're saying, we think this is what we've found out... if they think there's something wrong, they ought to say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.595" offset="6980648">In the court of appeals they said they had an 800 number... never mentioned in the district court, never mentioned it in this Court in any of the papers... which they said that the Plaintiffs could have called to find out where these distributors were.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.701" offset="8365138">First, there was a series of litigation, related litigation between the parties here... various subsidiaries and the Petitioner's client, various subsidiaries of my client and the Petitioner's client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.742" offset="8409232">The litigation was not finally resolved until July of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.646" offset="8428877">The Advisory Committee notes expect that... suggest that Rule 11 sanctions should be imposed at the end of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.918" offset="8462000">Well, the litigation didn't end until July of '86.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.538" offset="8476419">Within two or three months thereafter, Mr. Cooter, Petitioner's senior counsel, appeared before Judge Gasch in another completely unrelated case, the Kuwait Airlines v. American Security case that's referred to in the Petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.463" offset="8536188">When that case was completed in the district court, as Petitioner has noted, Judge Gasch called the motion up for... for a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.736" offset="8573281">It could have been complete... it's completely equally plausible, is our submission, that the... we could speculate that Judge Gasch was essentially giving the Petitioner and its senior partner consideration in not ruling on the Rule 11 motion that was pending before him in our litigation while Mr. Cooter was before him in a... in a completely separate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.066" offset="8650604">Now, that's equally plausible speculation, I say, but it's speculation and, in any event, it doesn't have a jurisdictional foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.403" offset="8683936">It doesn't stop the district court from... from finally acting when it... when it did act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.290" offset="8703476">But it seems clear to us that Rule 41 cannot preempt or give a... a lawyer an absolute immunity bath for anything he does before the dismissal of the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.980" offset="14094209">We believe Rule 38 of the appellate rules and Section 1912 of 28 U.S.C. govern the recovery of fees, including attorney's fees on appeal, and they are the exclusive rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.621" offset="14140811">Nothing the advisory committee notes on Rule 11 indicates that it was intended to be a fee-shifting statute or rule for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.691" offset="14169023">With respect to the tripartite analysis that we urge upon you in terms of scope of review, you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, it's likely to produce more appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.881" offset="14201833">It's likely to produce more careful appellate review, it's like to have lawyers coming up to the courts of appeals more often.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.801" offset="14225552">It's what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.151" offset="14230881">It really is about where the lawyer is hamstrung with questions of attorney/client privilege back at a time where they didn't know how to deal with that question and put forth all the facts before the district court... whether they're entitled to careful findings, the most careful kinds of scrutiny before the district judge rules, and whether before their reputations are impugned they're entitled to careful appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.412" offset="14303920">We submit that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.614" offset="14308726">Thank you.</text>
