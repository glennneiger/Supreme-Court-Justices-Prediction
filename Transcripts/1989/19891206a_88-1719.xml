            <text syncTime="41.708" offset="297118">The question presented in this case is whether there is a right to a jury trial in a case where an employee sues his union alleging a breach of the duty of fair representation whenever he seeks also some type of monetary damages, which in this case are the back pay.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. David James</label>
            <text syncTime="60.486" offset="372246">It certainly didn't draw the crowd that the first one did.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.038" offset="382486">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="64.489" offset="388233">It is, however, important for not only these parties, but for the large number of cases that this raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.411" offset="419893">We contend that there is no right to a jury trial in such a case, and we do that based upon the historical analysis that this Court has set forth we should follow in Seventh Amendment questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.987" offset="478199">We have to go to the Seventh Amendment because, like everybody agrees, there is no statutory right to a jury trial and so the question turns on if there is a right to a jury trial, it could be found only in the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.497" offset="532324">The first, and this Court has set out that that's a two-pronged test, look at the historical analog to see if this is more like an equitable or a legal action, and then turn to the more important issue, what are the types of remedies asked for in the case, the nature of those remedies and are they more legal or equitable in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.141" offset="606825">We say, turning to the first prong, that this, while not recognized in... at the time the Constitution and the Seventh Amendment was enacted... the duty of fair representation action was not recognized then... that the duty of fair representation action does have its origin in the traditions of equities law trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.276" offset="707449">And we have discussed that our brief... in our briefs at some length, how the union in a duty of fair representation case is much like a trustee situation that was found prior to the enactment of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.737" offset="777248">A union, like a trustee, is given discretionary power to be exercised for the benefit of certain employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.057" offset="806505">In Steele v. L&amp;N Railroad, this Court recognized that the union, like a trustee, must act on behalf of these employees non-arbitrarily, must act in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.567" offset="868572">The relationship that we find between a union and the employees that it represents is very much like that between a trustee and beneficiaries that it represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.458" offset="912145">The union has broad discretion, just like a trustee has broad discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.545" offset="932520">The trustee, or a union, can represent employees or beneficiaries with divergent, even conflicting interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.253" offset="979332">That's unlike the lawyer/client relationship where the client controls and tells the lawyer what he has to do and can withdraw, have other counsel, if he does not like what the attorney is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.578" offset="1032621">With a union, an employee cannot insist that the union take any specific action.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.517" offset="1060416">It... the union, like a trustee... has discretion to decide itself what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.003" offset="1090300">And as long as it stays within the certain bounds allowed by the courts in that discretion, the employee cannot force the union, just like a beneficiary could not force a trustee to take any particular action.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.211" offset="1139096">Thus, we say that the duty of fair representation action is very similar to the trust action which was found prior to the enactment of the Seventh Amendment, and it's clear that those trust actions were developed solely in equity, that they were not recognized in law courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.142" offset="1218822">And we say that, therefore, if you look at the nature of the duty of fair representation action, it is most like that trust analogy and it's thus equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.766" offset="1261350">That's particular seen in the sort of hybrid action that we have here where a union is sued by an employee who claims that the union did not take some action properly and at the same time the employee claims the company that it... is its employer also acted improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.763" offset="1345359">That is very similar to the old trust actions where a... an... a beneficiary of a trust would say the trustee should have taken some action against a third party but... and it was an abuse of its discretion, the trustee's discretion, not to take that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.842" offset="1429683">And, therefore, in equity courts... not in law courts, could not do it there... but in equity courts the beneficiary would go in and say to the court, the trustee has acted improperly in not taking this action against the third party, and the third party has acted improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.619" offset="1492794">Give me a remedy against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.638" offset="1504811">That is something that it is clear could not be done in law courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.410" offset="1539919">In that situation it was not unusual for the equity court to give money damages as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.265" offset="1571371">It was... they could give the traditional equitable remedies also, but they also gave money damages against a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.585" offset="1604599">And we've cited some cases and cited some authorities about that so that if actions of the third party were harmful to the beneficiary, caused it to lose some money, and because of running the statute of limitations or some reason that money could not be recovered from the third party, it could be recovered from the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.581" offset="1688608">Or, it could be recovered from both.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.448" offset="1696132">But, in any case, it was a money damage recoverable in equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.518" offset="3892403">And that was recognized by this Court, I think, in Curtis v. Loether where it says that just because it's monetary damages you don't say that that always makes it legal relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.778" offset="5117441">If you look at our brief, we talk at length about how the parties in these agreements really negotiate for a decision by an arbitrator and give an arbitrator wide discretion as to what relief is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.087" offset="5174597">It is not at all unusual for an employee who is discharged to go to arbitration and be found that the company has improperly discharged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.360" offset="5211691">But then be placed back at work without back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.062" offset="5222558">It is not at all unusual to have that sort of remedy come in an arbitration proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.132" offset="5246799">If the idea is to make whole the employee, not give him a windfall, then I think that you have to look at what were the possible remedies he could get in an arbitrator's decision but for this DFR breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.158" offset="5310956">And if that's true, then there is this wide range of discretion given to arbitrators that I think carries over into the DFR area as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.283" offset="5347423">And because you have that wide range of discretion which is applicable not only to the arbitrator's decision, not only applicable for the board, but also by the courts in the duty of fair representation area, the remedy, the nature of the remedy, is an equitable remedy and not a legal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.328" offset="5427567">When you take that prong, the stronger of the two prongs, and it clearly says that the remedies are equitable, and attach it to the first prong which says that the nature of the action was basically an equitable... like an equitable... not exactly the same, but like the old trust action... then I conclude that the action here, the duty of fair representation action in this sort of hybrid situation, is an equitable action, does not call for a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment, and that the district court was incorrect below when they denied our motion to strike their jury trial demand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.498" offset="5776249">The question in this case is whether there are legal issues and remedies involved in this case which must be tried before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.121" offset="5806760">If there are, this Court has said in its past decisions, that the Seventh Amendment applies and that my clients, or respondents, are entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.144" offset="5838839">Now, in response... or in his argument, the petitioner states, or tries to wrap the entire action in a trust cloak, so to speak, and tries to say that because this action has some resemblance to a trust, that that analogy should pervade the entire analysis and go off over to the second prong of the Ross test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.961" offset="5942179">And, therefore, since there maybe some resemblance to a trust, that the remedy sought in this case should be considered trust remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.483" offset="5980213">We contend that that analogy does not fit for a number of reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.914" offset="6805996">My point is that in this case we're not talking about a great discretionary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.668" offset="6832954">We're talking about an absolute duty to these union members to represent them on a grievance, which is a duty much more akin to the duty of a lawyer than it is to the duty of a trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.447" offset="6904112">The essence of our case is discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.249" offset="6919263">The change of operation procedure was designed to allow my clients the right to follow their work to Winston-Salem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.105" offset="6954685">At the time they followed their work they were supposed to have some seniority preferences because they were following their work, theoretically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.277" offset="6991361">The order of recalls and layoffs after that were in direct violation of that procedure which had been devised by the collective bargaining procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.001" offset="7038277">At that time we have alleged that the union, in direct discrimination or blatant discrimination against my clients, sided with the locals, the local inactive people who had been off the board, to try to bring them back on the board, at which time they would dovetail in my clients seniority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.583" offset="8268644">Now, you know... and there are other... there are certainly other characteristics of this action which are not so close to a lawyer, and I'm not denying that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.988" offset="8302290">But I'm just saying that's probably the best common law analog to the case in its posture before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.661" offset="8332905">But there are several other reasons the trust analogy does not fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.362" offset="8347743">Trust, as I understand it, was created by the courts of equity because courts of law did not recognize the distinction between legal and beneficial title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.219" offset="8383165">Therefore, beneficiaries... beneficiaries had no rights before courts of law and the re... courts of equity recognized rights... that there was no adequate remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.241" offset="8423289">So these trusts... beneficiaries had to go to courts of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.728" offset="8441261">There's no property in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.728" offset="8449203">And that was it... an absolute essential element of a trust, that there be a corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.333" offset="8475639">Now the petitioner tries to argue that the contract rights was property in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.904" offset="8497895">But I'd contend that the only thing about this case that resembles the trust relationship is the relationship itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.142" offset="8526839">And that relationship is recognized and was recognized at law just as well as it was at equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.498" offset="8556305">It's... it's the confidential relationship between these parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.283" offset="8571456">It's no different from the relationship between the director in the corporation in Ross... there's no difference between that relationship and the relationship we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.971" offset="8606146">And if the only thing that resembles a trust is the relationship which was also recognized at law, the trust analogy loses... loses its force, its persuasive force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.946" offset="8654107">That relationship, as this Court found in Ross, could be the focus of an illegal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.052" offset="8686499">In Ross the case... the legal issues that were found were negligence and breach of contract by a director who owed a fiduciary duty to his corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.758" offset="8725369">Another issue was breach of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.479" offset="8748252">So, the union membership... the union member relationship in this case does not magically convert this action to a trust action any more than the director's relationship did in Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.786" offset="8793496">Even beyond the derivative stockholder standing issue, the relationship itself is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.440" offset="8824112">Going to the second part of the Ross test, the nature of relief, in this Court's... it's clear that this Court has recognized on a number of occasions that, generally speaking, monetary relief is traditional legal relief because there was an adequate remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.322" offset="8915541">And that's what we have here in DFR actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.174" offset="8927034">But more importantly, when this Court has been... has decided cases involving statutory rights to a jury trial, the Court has looked at statutory intent on the specific statute at issue, such as Title VII or the ADEA in the Lorillard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.171" offset="9006969">We contend that in deciding the issue in this case there is no statutory intent because it's a judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.341" offset="9035704">But this Court should look at the judicial common law, the federal common law which has evolved over the years in DFR actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.633" offset="9076873">And that... the number of decisions decided by this Court in the DFR... 301 DFR area indicates that this... that monetary damages is a form of legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.940" offset="9126088">Even the Steele case said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.023" offset="9134342">The Steele decision, while saying it was a grant of power to act on behalf of another... which inferred some relationship not necessarily trust, Steele also said that the full range of judicial remedies should be available to a victim of the breach of duty of fair representation, including injunction and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.104" offset="9214695">The Vaca court underscored that in talking about the compensation principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.441" offset="9236115">The Faust court, while striking punitive damages, again emphasized the compensation principle and the very distinction between this kind of action and the action before the NLRB on an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.850" offset="9289719">That this type of action that's involved is focused on the individual, the private right of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.004" offset="9314274">And I believe this Court underscored that principle once again in its decision yesterday in the Breininger case, that there are two different types of actions, two different sets... at least, to some extent, two different sets of policies and two different sets of rules because one was created or implied... or one was recognized by the board according to a statute and the other was recognized by this Court and implied... developed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.404" offset="9419913">And in the Faust case I think it becomes even clearer in the concurring opinion by Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.975" offset="9442169">Justice Blackmun stated, along with three other members of this Court, that punitive damages... there should be no per se rule against punitive damages because Steele recognized the full range of judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.800" offset="9497549">And that should include punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.502" offset="9508311">Now, this Court, as a matter of federal labor policy, the majority decided to strike punitive damages at least in that kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.306" offset="9535479">But the fact remains that while limiting the range of remedies, this Court has always at least implicitly recognized that we're dealing with legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.214" offset="9583126">And for that reason, this case is very distinguishable from the Title VII case and the cases under the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.289" offset="9631505">The last point I'd like to make on the second part of the Ross test is that the other theories on which back pay in various types of actions has been found to be equitable relief has to do... is whether it's restitutionary, whether it's ancillary to or incidental to equitable relief or whether specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.489" offset="9728262">As Justice Marshall I think stated in Curtis, for the same reason restitution was not an appropriate theory in that case, it's not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.296" offset="9775492">This... this... we're not trying to discourage the company or the union from any kind of unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.748" offset="9793255">We're not trying to follow money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.366" offset="9799733">We're trying to seek compensation for what we've lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.402" offset="9815929">In conclusion, we contend that these individuals who've alleged that their union sold them out in effect, and discriminated against them in favor of the other members, have a right to a jury trial on this case which presents legal issues and monetary relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2514.697" offset="10189062">In hindsight, we should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.597" offset="10192719">It was just one of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.547" offset="10196481">We never could understand that claim, and we always thought it was inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.934" offset="10214035">They never said it once before, and so we didn't make that motion at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.136" offset="10226888">But I think he's right, it is inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.837" offset="10233679">I've never understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.704" offset="10237128">There's no contract breach about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.371" offset="10243815">They got what the contract was... required about the moving expenses, and so I've always ignored that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.527" offset="10268370">I do want to say that we think that the trust analogy is much more apt than the legal malpractice analogy principally because of the discretion given the union to act on behalf of these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.001" offset="10322287">An attorney does not have that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.120" offset="10330750">It... an attorney cannot represent conflicting views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.822" offset="10345588">A union does do that all the time and so did a trustee who had beneficiaries with conflicting interests, directly conflicting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.397" offset="10395848">And that's why we say that the trust analogy is more apt in this case than is that legal malpractice action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.902" offset="10421865">In fact, a union doesn't have any duty to file the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.370" offset="10439733">If it files it, it doesn't have to take it to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.322" offset="10451541">it can even refuse to take something to arbitration because it's too costly if in its exercise of discretion yet in good faith determines that for the best interests of everyone in that group this grievance should not be taken to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.768" offset="10525415">An attorney doesn't have that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.126" offset="10594796">I've seen someplace... some people call it the standard of conduct rather than the standard of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.514" offset="10612350">That doesn't help me a whole lot to understand the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.216" offset="10623113">But with a trustee and with a union, they have this discretion... discretion of whether they should bring this claim or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.572" offset="10656550">If a client comes to an attorney and employs and attorney and says, I want you to bring this claim, and the attorney just doesn't, well, he breaches his standard of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.594" offset="10692703">He can't make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.511" offset="10700331">The union can make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.213" offset="10707123">The trustee can make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.646" offset="10712870">That's why we think that analogy is more apt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.915" offset="10725931">It's also... the rights of the employee in this case are not equal to simple contract rights against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.924" offset="10777967">The employee must rely upon the union, like a beneficiary must rely upon the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.578" offset="10800641">And the rights the employees have are like the rights beneficiaries have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.197" offset="10819136">That is, they come from this trust relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.684" offset="10837003">All of that leads us to conclude that this is more analogous to the trust situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.838" offset="10869604">Finally, just one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.290" offset="10875456">In talking about whether the... he mentioned in Ross how there was a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.944" offset="10906071">This Court specifically reserved the question and did not say that... whether that had a right to a jury trial on that issue or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.965" offset="10934179">The only issues in Ross that it found it... was a right to a jury trial were the clearly legal issues.</text>
