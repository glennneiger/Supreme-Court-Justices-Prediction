            <text syncTime="14.574" offset="203527">In a series of cases involving Fourth Amendment challenges to various traffic-checking procedures, the Court has applied a balancing test which weighs the public interest against the right of individuals to be free from arbitrary interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.917" offset="260892">In these cases, the Court recognized that different procedures involve different balances and different constitutional safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.839" offset="292657">For example, probable cause is required for a search of a vehicle either by a roving patrol or at a fixed checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.909" offset="324944">A seizure of an automobile by a roving patrol is permissible if it is based on reasonable suspicion, and in Martinez-Fuerte the Court held that seizure of an automobile at a fixed checkpoint is permissible without individualized suspicion if there are neutral and objective guidelines which limit the discretion of officers in the field and limit the nature of the intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.810" offset="424523">The case today presents no new legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.345" offset="438629">The only question is whether Michigan's temporary sobriety checkpoints are like the roving patrols in Delaware v. Prouse or, as we argue, are more like the fixed checkpoints in Martinez-Fuerte in which no individualized suspicion is required.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.999" offset="2141290">The purpose is a little different, but the Court has recognized in Delaware v. Prouse, for example, that the state... pardon me... the state has a very significant interest in assuring that drivers are properly licensed and have proof of insurance and registration and that vehicles have the required safety equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.611" offset="2215687">The nature of the problem here is even more serious than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.480" offset="2231151">We're talking about hundreds of deaths and tens of thousands of injuries every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.116" offset="2245780">In Brown v. Texas, the Court applied a balancing test and discussed several of the traffic-checking cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.657" offset="2291860">In all the parties below in state courts, we use the Brown v. Texas articulation as the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.577" offset="2319550">There, the court identified three factors which go into weighing whether a particular procedure is reasonable or not: the gravity of the public concern, the extent to which the seizure advances the public interest and the severity of the interference with individual liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.503" offset="2383288">We believe that the record in our case is sufficient to demonstrate that the checkpoints are reasonable under all three of these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.443" offset="2415053">The gravity of the public concern is undisputed by plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.978" offset="2433235">It's widely recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.928" offset="2436996">The key point where the state courts went wrong, we submit, is in its conclusion that the checkpoints were not effective enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.285" offset="2474404">The court in Michigan said that we did not prove a sufficiently high arrest rate, we did not prove long-term deterrent effects from the operation of the checkpoints and we did not prove that they were the most effective method the police could use.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.795" offset="2536470">We submit that the state courts severely distorted the appropriate balancing test when they held us to that kind of impossible burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.984" offset="2569176">We think that in this context where you have a very serious public problem and minimal intrusion, all that the... all that needs to be shown is reasonable effectiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.907" offset="6612931">There are two reasons why the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.977" offset="6637173">The first is based on this Court's decision last term in Von Raab, and also in the Court's decision in Skinner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.963" offset="6661101">In that case... in those two cases, this Court indicated the situations under which the Court would refer to the balancing test in determining whether a particular Fourth Amendment intrusion was in fact unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.871" offset="6716794">In Von Raab and Skinner, this Court indicated that where the particular type of intrusion serves law enforcement needs... or, excuse me... serves governmental needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement, then the Court would refer to a balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.518" offset="6791295">This case presents, for the first time, I believe, in this Court, a situation in which a suspicionless, warrantless seizure is being conducted solely for one purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.075" offset="6841555">And that is to enforce the criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.944" offset="6853048">Under the decisions of this Court's last term, in Skinner and Von Raab, this Court need not even refer to the balancing test, in light of the fact that there is no dispute that the reason this particular seizure takes place is to in fact enforce the criminal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.155" offset="12113901">But as this court found in Delaware v. Prouse there is a sort of marginal utility, if you will, to the... a police technique which has to be analyzed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.197" offset="12162070">In Delaware versus Prouse, for example, the court found that these types of stops which were at issue in that case weren't going to result in a marginal increase in the... in the problem, the crime problem which the police were attempting to combat in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.372" offset="12222779">The same is true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.158" offset="12229884">The third prong which I would like to address of the Court's balancing test concerns the scope of the intrusion, and on this point I think there's a couple of misconceptions regarding the position which the State has taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.870" offset="12300728">The State attempts to justify this program on the basis that this is a minimal intrusion for approximately 30 to 60 seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.309" offset="12338554">In... in fact, there are a number of other factors related to the intrusion which impact on... on the analysis which this Court must apply in the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.033" offset="12389440">First of all, there is the... the point which has been made before with respect to the number of innocent drivers passing through these checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.155" offset="12425907">At... at its best, these checkpoints allow 99 percent of the cars to go through because these people are innocent of any wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.030" offset="12473346">In addition, there is another disquieting, I believe, aspect to these sobriety roadblocks which has come out in the evidence in this case, and that is there is a significant number of what I would call false positives which have been developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.456" offset="12531128">In other words, the program works that people will go through a... go through these sobriety roadblocks, be stopped temporarily... that is, the stop which the... which the State represents as being very short in duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.716" offset="12584105">In actuality, a number of people will be diverted to another area where they will be further investigated, including a number of tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.738" offset="12624229">What the evidence from other sobriety roadblocks has indicated is that you have twice as great a possibility of being diverted to these... for this further investigation and not being drunk than you have of being drunk when you're diverted to these--</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.999" offset="13213238">We brought this case not in attempt... not in an attempt to demonstrate that drunk driving is not a serious societal problem in this country.</text>
