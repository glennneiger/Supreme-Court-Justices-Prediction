            <text syncTime="14.352" offset="204972">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.529" offset="253664">This case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.291" offset="264740">First, whether a court order directing a parent to produce her child compels incriminating testimony in violation of the Fifth Amendment and, secondly, whether in this case the mother's privilege claim is overcome by the important societal interest in protecting a child plainly at risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.035" offset="351676">I will address the first of these issues and the child's counsel will address the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.327" offset="372887">The child who is the subject of this case was born in October 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.723" offset="394412">As of four months of age he had been hospitalized twice with confirmed fractures of major bones.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.316" offset="424818">During his second hospitalization his mother was observed shaking him and dropping him into his crib while he was in a cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.592" offset="461912">The Baltimore City Department of Social Services filed a petition with the juvenile court in Baltimore asserting that Maurice was a child in need of assistance, as defined by Maryland law.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.392" offset="513112">A court hearing was held on that petition at which all parties were represented by counsel and the parties stipulated to the facts of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.938" offset="555326">Maurice was placed in foster care, where he remained for some months when the order was modified to return physical custody to the mother.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Tyler, III</label>
            <text syncTime="124.932" offset="647277">I think... certainly with benefit of hindsight it was a great error to return the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.747" offset="666503">The record reflects that the agency opposed that before the Master, but did not take an appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.452" offset="701403">Well, I would have to respectfully answer no, it wasn't apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.355" offset="720943">The parties determined and the court concurred that the child should be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.738" offset="742467">At a further hearing in the case in August, the parties, again all represented by counsel, agreed to an order of protective supervision finding Maurice to be a child in need of supervision under the supervision of the Department of Social Services and the mother had physical custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.262" offset="824596">Importantly, that order provided, among other things, that the mother was required to cooperate with the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.858" offset="855003">She, represented by counsel, agreed to that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.919" offset="871199">Agency personnel have last seen this child in December... in September of 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.114" offset="900038">In April of '88, after making repeated efforts to locate the child, the Agency filed a petition in the juvenile court in Baltimore seeking a review of the court order and ordered a show of cause and a petition for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.303" offset="956776">After arrest, the mother, with counsel at her side, told the juvenile court that the child was with the mother's sister in Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.768" offset="990631">This proved to be false and she gave other information as to the child's whereabouts, which similarly proved to be false.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.454" offset="1017380">The court held her in contempt and sent her to jail providing that she could purge herself of contempt by either producing the child before the court or revealing his exact whereabouts.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.112" offset="1135976">Well, in cases where orders have been entered to require turning over some kind of paper, this Court has indicated in its opinions that to do so has testimonial aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.073" offset="1203894">Why wouldn't turning over the child have some testimonial aspects as to her possession or control, or something of that sort?</text>

            <text syncTime="275.322" offset="1248825">--Because, Justice O'Connor, in the cases where the Court has said that there would be testimonial content to an act of production, the identified variables have been existence, possession, authentication.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.180" offset="1304309">And if those items are foregone conclusions or not in dispute, which we submit is this case, then the act of production has no testimonial effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.470" offset="1357390">You don't know where the child is.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.500" offset="1373586">She has apparently given untrue statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.773" offset="1386647">And so it isn't known.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.684" offset="1394275">And I assume the state would want to use the testimonial aspects if it were ever to file criminal proceedings against her.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.782" offset="1630735">Secondly, she was then arrested and brought before the court and gave the court an address in Dallas where the child was to be found.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.852" offset="2235000">And the state could make it a laser-like limited immunity so that just the testimonial aspects of production could be protected, I gather.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.078" offset="2279826">But, again, I would stress that first we should not be put to that choice until she prevails entirely in this Court as would any person who was asked to perform an act if it is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.979" offset="2339489">The state should not be required to provide immunity because, for example, as the court noted in Braswell, there are costs to doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.785" offset="2370732">The costs of granting immunity should be considered and the state should not be required to grant it until she absolutely prevails here.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.522" offset="2413677">But the state's position, we believe, is supported really by two lines of authority in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.636" offset="2438128">First, the Schmerber line of authority and then the Fisher and act of production cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.112" offset="2468012">The Schmerber line certainly established that the general rule is that the Fifth Amendment does not relieve a person of the obligation to produce incriminating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.969" offset="2515450">And we submit that the great flaw in the decision below, and a flaw which is largely conceded in the brief of the Respondent, is to put all the weight in the case on the potential incrimination of producing the child when in fact that is only half the test and that we do not dispute that it may have some incriminating effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.943" offset="2611372">But that does not make it testimonial any more than a person is relieved of the obligation to provide a blood sample, a handwriting exemplar, stand in a lineup, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.152" offset="2656198">Further, the elements in the act of production cases of existence, possession, authentication are here not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.257" offset="2696531">Maurice was with his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.570" offset="2709801">She has never claimed to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.522" offset="2721609">She has never claimed that she cannot comply with the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.846" offset="2738954">Her sole defense in this case and the holding of the Maryland court was not that she could not comply, but that she need not comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.650" offset="2778138">That the order was... was void the moment it was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.993" offset="2791512">And that, in our view, is a dangerous and unwarranted extension of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.657" offset="2822232">To hold as a matter of federal constitutional law that a parent cannot be required to produce her child in court because to do so would constitute testimony, would ultimately remove from the juvenile court the single most important power it must have, and that is the minimal power to require a parent to bring her child before the court so that the court can satisfy itself that the child is safe or if not safe, to provide protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.450" offset="2957338">And that is what is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.991" offset="2967473">It is the power of the court to command the parent to bring her child into court.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.838" offset="3110938">First, this Court must decide whether the needs of my client, an infant who is defenseless, who has been previously abused and whose whereabouts have been unknown for the past 18 months, must be abandoned in favor of an unprecedented extension of the... of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.806" offset="3290765">Your Honor, limited use immunity is available only upon the consent or the request of the state's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.231" offset="3324515">The state's attorney was not a party to the juvenile court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.954" offset="3339352">The state's attorney has discretion whether his or her law enforcement interests outweigh the needs of the juvenile court.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.790" offset="3374670">The juvenile court does not have the power to confer use immunity nor did any of the other parties in the juvenile court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.436" offset="3405285">Similarly, in other states where use immunity may not be available, that solution... would not assist the juvenile court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.693" offset="3442379">In this particular case, however, limited use immunity would satisfy the need for Maurice's production, but it is a speculative assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.372" offset="3485011">And if we look at the availability of immunity for every conflict which arises between civil regulatory systems and potential incriminations, then the entire line of cases of this court, dating from United States v. Sullivan in the income tax reporting system through wartime price regulation in Shapiro v. United States, on through deterrence of drunk driving and traffic accident reporting in Byers v. California, would automatically fall out.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.801" offset="3618758">Immunity is not the answer that this Court has held to those fundamental clashes between civil regulation and potential incriminating disclosures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.819" offset="5046820">In that case, the court upheld a less vital state interest, the adjudication of civil property damage claims against appreciably stronger Fifth Amendment interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.626" offset="5094049">Byers held that neutral noncriminal statutes can compel incriminating information if they are part of a civil regulatory system which in no way targets criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.465" offset="5141383">That was a plurality opinion, and Justice Harlan joined that opinion to create a majority by establishing a balancing test when valid civil governmental interests are asserted against possible Fifth Amendment incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.224" offset="5208466">Justice Harlan phrased the balance test by looking at the nature of the governmental interest, the nature of the type... or the type of incrimination which would incur, and, finally, the necessity for the information which would be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.345" offset="5276907">Under either approach, the plurality approach, or Justice Harlan's approach, this case amply satisfies those tests.</text>
