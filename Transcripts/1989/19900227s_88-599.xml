            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87119">The opinion of the Court in No. 88-599, Washington against Harper will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.301" offset="124317">This case is before us on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.417" offset="144693">It is Washington versus Harper.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.288" offset="156187">Walter Harper is the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.444" offset="164859">For most of the times since 1976, he was a prisoner in the Washington State Penal System.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.203" offset="191922">He has been diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder which causes him to pose a likelihood of serious harm to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.936" offset="222851">It is an accepted medical practice to treat persons with conditions like Harper’s with antipsychotic drugs these are sometimes called psychotropic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.442" offset="268827">The drugs in most cases are an effective means of treating some mental illnesses, but they may have serious side effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.112" offset="299547">While in prison, Harper accepted this treatment for a time, but then objected to its continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.370" offset="324520">He brought suit in the Washington State Courts alleging, among other points, that he was entitled to a judicial hearing before the drugs could be administered to him by prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.977" offset="366943">Reversing the State Trial Court, the Washington Supreme Court held that a judicial hearing is required before the drug treatments can continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.634" offset="401633">We granted certiorari and we now reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.454" offset="420859">There is an initial procedural point as to whether or not the case is moot, and we hold that it is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.117" offset="447504">We hold that the written policy of the Washington prison officials governing the use of these drugs does not violate the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.056" offset="491286">Although Harper has a clear liberty interest in avoiding the unwarranted administration of antipsychotic drugs, the state has an interest in providing a prison inmate with appropriate medical treatment for a mental illness which renders him dangerous to himself or others.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.888" offset="554606">Washington’s written policy which permits a dangerous and mentally ill inmate to be treated with antipsychotic drugs when medically appropriate is a reasonable means of reconciling the inmate’s and the state’s interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.040" offset="603194">The policy satisfies the procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.234" offset="616046">The decision is made by a committee composed of the prison psychiatrist or psychologist and an administrator, none of them concurrently be involved in the inmate’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.944" offset="658887">The decision is made after a full hearing with the prisoner having a knowledgeable person to assist him in presenting any objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.945" offset="686890">The decision to be made here is medical in nature, not judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.151" offset="703713">Our precedents recognized that in such cases, the state can reasonably decide that medical professionals, not judges, are the most appropriate decision makers.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.653" offset="737672">Justice Blackmun has joined the opinion of the Court and has filed a separate concurring opinion; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Brennan and Marshall join.</text>
