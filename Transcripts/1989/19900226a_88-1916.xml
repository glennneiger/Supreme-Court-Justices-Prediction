            <text syncTime="1296.187" offset="5328777">In fact, you could see that without any basis, other than someone saying that, by the way, in the apartment next door there's a dangerous felon, you wouldn't want the police, in the ordinary run of the situation, to go into homes on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.161" offset="5376738">In this case, there's arguably a little bit more, because the police had talked to the occupant of the lower unit before, and what she said was corroborated by what the telephone tipster said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.908" offset="5455628">If the detective had not called inside, he would have had to mount an impromptu stakeout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.895" offset="5483631">That was not reasonable, because the detective could reasonably anticipate that Olson would have discovered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.966" offset="5503902">There were eight uniformed police officers in marked patrol cars outside the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.120" offset="5524487">The odds were overwhelmingly likely that Olson, a fugitive from justice and on notice that the police were after him because he had just escaped from them the morning before, would have peeked outside and discovered the stakeout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.010" offset="5572134">In that event, you would have... all the dangerous things would have happened of evidence taking, armed resistance... or evidence destruction, excuse me... or hostage taking, or armed resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.966" offset="5615915">Nor should, I think the loan homicide detective on duty that Saturday and Sunday be faulted for failing' to seek an arrest warrant, because the police did not plan the arrest of Olson at any home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.256" offset="5661055">Even if the police thought that Olson would return to the Bergstroms' unit for some reason, an arrest warrant would not have been sufficient to justify the intrusion on the Bergstroms' privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.862" offset="5699507">They would have needed a search warrant to search for Olson under Steagald v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.366" offset="5721554">And again, there would not have been probable cause to obtain that warrant at least until the occupant of the lower unit had called detective... the homicide detective at the police station at 2:30 p.m., at which time, of course, it was too late to have the couple of hours it would have taken to get a search warrant, enter the Bergstroms' unit, and find Olson in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.381" offset="5809535">Therefore, we submit that in this circumstance where the police reasonably believed that Respondent Olson was armed, that he was implicated in a violent crime... you know, felony murder, for which he was convicted... and knew that the police were within moments of surrounding him and getting him, that exigent circumstance justified the immediate entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.289" offset="6365211">Consent, or a right to admit, is really just the corollary or converse of a right to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.859" offset="6391438">Put another way, consenting to a search is just another way of saying that a person has waived his or her legitimate expectation of privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.831" offset="9743367">The Minnesota Supreme Court at great length expressly relied on Jones v. United States in making its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.853" offset="9775445">The factual circumstances of Jones are that Jones, on the day of the incident in question, admitted himself with a key, had a suit and a shirt at the apartment, that his home was elsewhere, that he paid nothing for the use of the apartment, and that he'd slept there for but a single night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.796" offset="9839184">The only distinguishing factor between this case and Jones is that Jones had possession of a key.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.855" offset="10615438">At the outset, let me point out that I'm not certain that this is a very good case for this Court to decide whether or not exigent circumstances existed, because the Solicitor General and the petitioner both agree that one of the prerequisites for the determination of an exigency is that there be probable cause at the time of the respondent's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.001" offset="10700075">In its decision, the Minnesota Supreme Court expressly decide... determined that they would not decide the probable cause issue but simply assume that probable cause existed for the purpose of answering his constitutional challenges and ultimately reversed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.630" offset="10770606">Accordingly, if this Court wishes to look at exigent circumstances, I think that the appropriate resolution here would be to remand it... remand this decision back to the Minnesota Supreme Court with instructions to determine whether or not probable cause in fact existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.772" offset="11543099">I don't have any problem with the finding that all that would be needed in this case is an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.076" offset="11564310">I began the defense with the assumption that all that was necessary was an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.294" offset="11585208">However, even if a search warrant was necessary, that doesn't very well... that doesn't very much help the state's claims as far as exigent circumstances, because their entire position in this proceeding is that an arrest warrant is very difficult to get it and a search warrant is very easy to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.572" offset="11650305">So if all that was necessary was a search warrant, it would have been very easy for them to get one to arrest my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.143" offset="11672666">Certainly on the day before the police were able to obtain one in a relatively brief period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.845" offset="11691474">As far as the state's argument is concerned that an arrest warrant was more difficult to obtain, they're very hard-pressed to come forward with any proof of that, Your Honor, because they made no effort to obtain one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.486" offset="11737972">Indeed, the investigating detective testified that in his 20 years as a police officer, he'd never before tried to obtain an arrest warrant on a weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.258" offset="11773081">So there is nothing before this Court that suggests that respondent's arrest would have been delayed, if the police would have simply taken the step of approaching a neutral and detached magistrate and requesting some type of warrant be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.653" offset="11842671">More than that, I would suggest that it's basically conjectural to believe that the respondent was armed at... when the police made the decision to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.746" offset="11895020">Certainly the crime involved was a grave one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.980" offset="11904007">I'm not about to deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.098" offset="11908395">But at the time he fled from the police, the respondent was observed to be unarmed, and even the police anonymous tipster made no allegation that the respondent was armed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.537" offset="11946220">In essence, what we have here is a situation whereas the prosecution and the Solicitor General hope to define exigent circumstances, it will in effect strike away at the heart of Payton v. New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.130" offset="12000555">The Solicitor General comes in here and says that whenever a dangerous felon is known to be... knows that he's cornered by the police, the police have a right to go in and arrest him without making the presumption... without going before a judge and attempting to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.425" offset="12073698">But consider the implications of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.626" offset="12082580">In this case, the police called up the respondent and said, come out and surrender yourself to us, and when he refused to do that, they used that as an exigency to suggest, having done that, now that he knows we're here, we can come in and arrest him, rather than simply trying to go before a judge at the outset and obtaining a warrant to authorize to authorize the respondent's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.807" offset="12175262">If exigency is defined as the Solicitor General hopes to define it, there will be no situation... absolutely no situation... where an arrest warrant will be required for a felon, because in every instance, the prosecution will be able to establish an exigency simply based on a phone call demanding that the suspect surrender himself voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.374" offset="12277558">And if he refuses to cooperate, then there's an exigency and they can go in and make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.345" offset="12297411">That will in essence sweep away most of the protection offered by the Fourth Amendment, at least in an arrest context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.832" offset="12327399">I would like to briefly conclude by mentioning something to the Court that occurred to me as I was rather nervously preparing for this argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.842" offset="12379435">It's almost exactly two years ago that I stood before a jury and that I told that jury that they had a young man's future in their live... in their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.912" offset="12411722">Well, this Court's decision will still have an immediate impact on Rob Olson's future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.149" offset="12432620">This case is now about something more than Rob Olson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.153" offset="12448607">It's about us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.303" offset="12453309">It's about what authority our Constitution gives to police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.124" offset="12472536">It's about who is protected by the Fourth Amendment, and it's about the judiciary's role in supervising the police exercise of their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.461" offset="12505868">I submit to this Court, the Fourth Amendment protects and cloaks me when I travel to California later this spring and stay with my friend and former roommate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.369" offset="12549545">I suggest that it cloaks my friends and associates who have come to watch me make this argument and are staying with their friends in Virginia, and I contend that it protects petitioner's counsel when she visits the home of her own parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.345" offset="12605447">I suggest and suspect that each one of us has a privacy expectation in these living arrangements, and I suggest that it is one that our society is prepared to honor, and that I ask that this Court recognize in its decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.047" offset="12728222">Not all guests have no expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.600" offset="12746403">It's important, however, to realize what the facts were in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.719" offset="12762913">In answer to the Chief Justice's question, he slept on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.956" offset="12779840">There was no evidence that he'd been given the run of the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.408" offset="12797708">Although he said that he had permission to stay indefinitely, the Bergstroms testified that he asked if he could stay a couple of days, and Louann Bergstrom testified that he could stay until she asked him to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.704" offset="12862909">He could have been evicted at any point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.104" offset="12872418">That, I think, is different than the situation when you stay at a relative's home, or you stay at a friend's for a specific length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.893" offset="12903660">In this case, furthermore, the Bergstroms were asked:</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.797" offset="12927275">"Miss Bergstrom, counsel just said that Mr. Olson was living there. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.265" offset="12941068">"Was he living there? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.232" offset="12944934">Answer:</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.899" offset="12947651">"No, he wasn't living there. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.617" offset="12954547">"He stayed there one night. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.751" offset="12959040">Moreover, it's true that police bear a heavy burden when attempting to demonstrate an urgent need for a warrantless home entry arrest... to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.995" offset="13032078">Such an urgent need is shown, however, when police must prevent an armed suspect, wanted for murder, from escaping into the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.951" offset="13067814">We ask that this Court reverse the holding of the Minnesota Supreme Court.</text>
