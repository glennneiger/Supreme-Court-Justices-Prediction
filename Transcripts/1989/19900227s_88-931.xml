            <text syncTime="9.995" offset="127038">These cases come to us on writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.382" offset="152638">Five individual petitioners, each received substantial severance payments from the Boeing Company, which is also a petitioner in one case, before leaving their jobs at Boeing to take jobs at the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.423" offset="208749">The government brought an action seeking to recover the amount of the payments against the employee and Boeing alleging violations of criminal statute 18 U.S.C. Section 209(a) which forbids a private party to pay and a government employee to receive any supplemental compensation for the employee’s government service.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.915" offset="294744">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that Section 209(a) does not apply to a severance payment made before a payee becomes a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.638" offset="337585">A literal reading of the statute’s text, as well as application of the rule of lenity support our conclusion that a recipient’s status as a government employee is an element of a Section 209(a) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.710" offset="393905">The judgment is accordingly reversed.</text>
