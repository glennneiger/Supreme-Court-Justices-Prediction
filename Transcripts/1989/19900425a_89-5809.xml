            <text syncTime="218.507" offset="1007282">Finally, Your Honor, in the third episode of argument, the prosecutor reached the level described in the Caldwell dissent where the court in dissent said... the dissenter said, if you go so far as to tell the jury that the appellate court's going to correct them if they're wrong, then that is the most severe kind of violation imaginable.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.186" offset="1094008">And even the dissent was willing to recognize that kind of statement would violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.574" offset="1111562">It was in this third episode where the prosecutor said, don't feel like you're the one.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.891" offset="1224829">Finally, the last words the jury heard from the prosecutor in the second rebuttal closing argument were as follows: I ask that you recommend because all you are doing is making a recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.465" offset="1271118">I ask that you recommend to this Court and to any other court that reviews Robert Sawyer's case that, as a jury, you recommend death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.228" offset="2506188">The compulsion coming down upon the state courts is coming from Zant v. Stephens, the Ramos decision, decisions which focus on the unacceptability of false information.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.988" offset="2565225">It's not a question of the jury relying on somebody, one actor or another, but false information being interjected into the jury's deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.113" offset="2609737">And that false information was clearly something a state court would have regarded as unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.866" offset="2632725">Those decisions suggest that false information makes it... would make a jury's verdict unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.853" offset="2656653">Then we have a second line.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.372" offset="2662713">The Caldwell problem stands where two doctrines... where two lines of authority converge.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.907" offset="2684865">That second line is the Lockett and Eddings cases which suggest that a sentencer, namely the jury here, cannot be precluded from considering mitigating evidence fully, as is their responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.850" offset="2744633">So, it is those two lines of authority upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.071" offset="2761561">In looking at the substance of the Caldwell rule, it is important to note that it is a narrow one.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.811" offset="2816522">It is the rare prosecutor who engages in argument, such as the argument that one finds in this case which was clearly prohibited under ABA standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.369" offset="2862707">Indeed, if this Court were to look at grants of Caldwell relief since Caldwell and before Caldwell, this Court would find that it is the rare prosecutor who engages in this error.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.474" offset="2899174">The narrow rule that is created to solve this narrow problem is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.228" offset="2926237">The statements must be false and misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.180" offset="2938044">The statements need to refer to the non-finality of the jury's verdict, to go to the heart of the jury's function to talk about the jury's decision-making power not being final.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.655" offset="2987886">A highly specialized kind of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.174" offset="2998021">Third, and perhaps most important, those statements must be focused, unambiguous and strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.261" offset="3026338">And, finally, they must uncorrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.313" offset="3042534">It is possible that if they... if they are corrected, that... that even these kinds of statements will be regarded as ones which have been taken care of.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.035" offset="3709388">--Well, counsel... I mean, Your Honor, an answer to that question is provided by a glance at the district court's opinion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.724" offset="3744183">If you look at the district court's opinion what you discover is the counsel in that case made a Donnelly claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.028" offset="3769365">In other words, the argument in that particular case was very specifically that it was unfair, that it was inflammatory, that he made statements that were not allowed to be made under the scope of state law, the Code of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.121" offset="3821714">And he added... blended, if you will... the kind of inarticulate seed of a Caldwell claim by saying, well, and it also lessened the jury's responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.775" offset="3852330">Then that particular claim was abused, but the district court went ahead and considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.964" offset="3881169">And this Court held in the per curiam opinion that it was really too late for this counsel to be bringing up another claim which had been abused and, moveover, the district court acted properly in relying on Donnelly, as he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.538" offset="3935399">And I believe the district court did act properly because that's the way the counsel painted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.509" offset="3951282">It would not be appropriate to allow counsel to... to make a claim that was really not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.163" offset="3973956">It was Justice Stevens in concurrence, who acting as perhaps defense counsel, might have or should have, noticed the... the seeds of a Caldwell error, which in fact was at that time well established under all these state court precedents, was something that would be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.589" offset="4035605">When faced with the narrow problem of Caldwell error, state courts responded in the pre-Furman era and in the post-Furman era responded dramatically by condemning these kinds of arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.967" offset="4105195">They used the same reasoning that was later adopted as Caldwell itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.371" offset="4130795">After Furman, state courts, mostly in the south, gave the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.192" offset="4158067">They would not tolerate this kind of argument in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.977" offset="4169143">We have Georgia and South Carolina in 1975... pardon me, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.714" offset="4192131">We have South Carolina and Louisiana in 1970 and 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.083" offset="4205610">Maryland, Mississippi, Kentucky, Oklahoma, more and more states join this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.170" offset="4233927">And these states, in their opinions, relied on pre-Furman death penalty law logically, as well as on Eighth Amendment principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.176" offset="4273946">They had two sources driving them toward the Caldwell rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.496" offset="4291291">If you are wondering how one can tell when state court decisions are informed by Federal principles, we would suggest two indicia which might be persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.304" offset="4338521">First, when state courts actually cite directly Eighth Amendment precedence, that suggests that they are cognizant of the Eighth Amendment principles and taking them into account and believe that they support the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.628" offset="4391811">And further, and most intriguingly, the use of these state court cases that were decided before Caldwell, when they come after Caldwell, they are treated interchangeably with the Caldwell opinion by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.955" offset="4445100">It's unusual, I would submit, for a state to treat its own decisions as though they were illustrations of a problem that was made up of Eighth Amendment law unless they really believe that those were the... equal in significance, the same kind of decision, the same kind of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.166" offset="4517930">Your Honor, with regard to Caldwell, some of the characteristics which explain why Caldwell is old law also suggest strongly that Caldwell belongs in that small catalogue of rights under Teague which deserve retroactive application as bedrock rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.199" offset="4614060">While it is... may usually be true that Teague's second exception was reserved for rights which are new, in fact, it's perfectly possible that a right that is very old may also be fundamental enough for Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.641" offset="4675814">And we submit there are two main reasons that Caldwell should belong in this bedrock rights category, as the ABA has suggested and as we argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.199" offset="4718028">First, Teague did establish some guidelines for bedrock rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.484" offset="4735164">Those guidelines reveal that this Court will look to see whether a right has emerged over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.574" offset="4767556">Caldwell is one of those rare Eighth Amendment rights which did emerge and there was a powerful state consensus supporting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.512" offset="4803291">Second, Teague's guidelines focus on a few cases, cases that the Teague court suggest belong in the category, and Caldwell is similar to those kinds of cases, such as the Mooney case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.307" offset="4874553">And perhaps most importantly, the Teague opinion stressed with regard to bedrock rights the significance of the liability and accuracy as the sort of the touchstone of the bedrock-right category.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.939" offset="5273078">However, that means that if the question to Your Honor's question is yes, then you have, and I have just accepted, a per se... shall we say carte blanche... validation of all Eighth Amendment rights into Teague.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.057" offset="5801482">Donnelly relied on the... so in fact the trial as to violate due process standard, which was not unique to closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.980" offset="5833247">That was the standard of this Court used again and again for due process violations with regard to jury instructions, the admission of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.634" offset="5863863">It was the garden variety due process expression of the test that this Court uses whenever an error is committed and the impact of that error needs to be weighed in light of the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.727" offset="5916212">A Donnelly situation involving a prosecutor, Your Honor, can happen in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.196" offset="5938051">The prosecutor can stray into an error, talk about something outside the record, say something bad about the defendant, and surely the due process test is appropriate for that kind of error for the same reason it fits all other traditional errors in all criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.307" offset="6002521">The Caldwell test is for a different problem, a problem that is avoidable, a rare error, and the Caldwell test has a special prejudice component built into it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.363" offset="6362697">The issue here... here is the retroactivity of Caldwell v. Mississippi to Sawyer's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.333" offset="6386625">Caldwell v. Mississippi cannot be applied retroactively because it is a new rule of law and it fits within... it does not fit within the second exception of Teague v. Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.807" offset="6432496">Caldwell is a new rule of law because it extended the Eighth Amendment to an area formerly regulated by due process and by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.330" offset="6466560">Before 1985, no case had addressed prosecutorial argument in the light of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.019" offset="6501355">Prosecutorial argument had always been dealt with under... due process analysis or under state law analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.792" offset="6532493">The prior cases of... from Furman to 1985 from this Court dealt with the Eighth Amendment as applied to procedures by which states would impose a death penalty and dealt with substantive issues which should go before the jury, such as aggravating circumstances; mitigating circumstances, jury instructions and things that the court would tell the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.740" offset="6628206">But never before had argument, mere argument, been raised to the level of the Eighth Amendment until Caldwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.077" offset="6657567">Now, we know from this Court, most recently in Boyde v. California, that argument is considered different from jury instruction and evidence, that a jury is told that they are not to rest their verdict on argument that mere argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.670" offset="6719948">Their verdict is to rest on evidence and on jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.789" offset="6736457">And so, when we talk about argument, we are talking about a different entity from what the cases had dealt with prior to Caldwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.160" offset="6769894">And there is no Federal case law to have predicted or dictated the outcome in Caldwell which applied the Eighth Amendment to prosecutorial argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.135" offset="6817855">And we know that from Caldwell itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.087" offset="6825587">If we look at the Caldwell opinion, Justice Marshall used Donnelly as a comparison, but then he used state law cases and the development of analysis on prosecutorial argument in the state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.143" offset="7381891">And that was the case out of Louisiana where the prosecutor did tell the jury about the mandatory statute that mandates an automatic direct appellate review of death penalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.582" offset="7423582">He used... and he used that statute to tell the... to urge the jury to vote for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.670" offset="7452003">When this Court reviewed it, it issued a per curiam opinion and said of the four issues on that case, the contentions warrant little discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.526" offset="7491396">But in the per curiam opinion this Court did review... briefly review the issues, and in response it acknowledged that the District Court had viewed the improper prosecutorial arguments under the Donnelly... under the Donnelly due process and... despite the fact that this could have been dismissed for abuse of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.040" offset="7577391">So, in 1983 this Court could have applied the Eighth Amendment to prosecutorial argument and it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.611" offset="7603722">And between 1983 and 1985, there were no Federal cases which predicted the outcome in Caldwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.633" offset="7635801">And that's my basic premise for arguing that Caldwell is a new rule of law if you look at the precedents out of this Court and out of the Federal circuits around the country up until 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.793" offset="7688464">The petitioner urges this Court to rely on the development of the jurisprudence in various states in order to say that Caldwell is not a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.201" offset="7742067">If this Court would rely on state court jurisprudence developed based on state law in order to say that Caldwell is an old rule, that would in itself would be a new rule for this Court and would be inapplicable to Sawyer here on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.728" offset="7816150">Because this Court as... most recently as Dugger v. Adams, said that the availability of a claim under state law does not establish a claim that was available under the U.S. Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.322" offset="7866514">And I submit to you that the... all of the state cases that the petitioner does cite address improper argument based on state law or based on no argument at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.213" offset="7918132">That some of the cases just merely say this argument was improper and they vacate the sentence or reverse the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.799" offset="7940493">So that the state law... if this Court says Caldwell is an old rule because of state law jurisprudence, that in itself would be a new rule and would be not available to Sawyer here on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.543" offset="7995455">I also think that petitioner is misguided in using Butler v. McKellar as a guidance that that discussion of state cases in Butler supports their view of Caldwell being an old rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.303" offset="8054491">In Butler v. McKellar this Court used the state court's interpretation of Edwards v. Arizona.</text>

            <label>Ms. Catherine Hancock</label>
            <text syncTime="2825.286" offset="11434423">First, Your Honor, the... the date of final conviction is this case was April 2nd, 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.825" offset="11472562">The Fifth Circuit unanimously treated that as the date properly under Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.462" offset="11487086">That was the date cert. was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.096" offset="11493669">The state here suggests that the date should be July.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.033" offset="11509447">If that were to be true, this Court would have to hold that when cert. is granted and a judgment is vacated, that's not a... somehow that's a final conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.488" offset="11547272">Teague sensibly uses the cert. denied date, because it provides a bright-line boundary for the last opportunity for review of Federal questions following a state appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.677" offset="11588023">Now, Ramos was decided the same day that the conviction was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.045" offset="11605473">Second, it's quite clear that the Darden case in a footnote recognized the dramatic difference between Caldwell error and Donnelly error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.335" offset="11642567">This Court established a wall between the two doctrines, recognizing the unique aspects of Caldwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.340" offset="11670674">Essentially the state's argument would do away with that wall, would blend back by various means the Donnelly analysis into a Caldwell inquiry, whether by modifying the correction standard or by other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.148" offset="11721874">The Fifth Circuit made a mistake that really was based on its belief that Caldwell added something to Donnelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.020" offset="11761371">With all due respect for the Fifth Circuit majority, Caldwell dealt with a problem that was an old capital sentencing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.943" offset="11793032">Donnelly dealt with a problem that was a generic, fair trial, every kind of case problem And when Caldwell came down, it ratified and echoed the consensus of what the rule should be for this old capital sentencing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.254" offset="11862309">Thus, Caldwell didn't add something to Donnelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.106" offset="11873698">It reinforced a particular line of thought about a particular problem, and it was really in some ways a coincidence that the two cases dealt with closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.014" offset="11925316">Finally, Your Honor, on the merits we submit that we have met the Caldwell standard, the Caldwell formula, which is strict and demanding, that we are similar to those rare cases where relief has been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.639" offset="11975785">And we seek to have this Court reaffirm Caldwell, reaffirm that wall between the doctrines and grant a re-sentencing hearing where a verdict may be determined by a jury that is not misled about its sentencing responsibilities.</text>
