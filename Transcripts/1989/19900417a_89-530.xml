            <text syncTime="13.824" offset="200994">The issue in this case involves the deductibility of the unrelated non-member business expenses of an exempt social club.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.913" offset="237357">Specifically, whether the government is correct that there is a per se rule requiring an exempt social club to intend to report a tax profit on its tax return in order to deduct a loss on such business.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.958" offset="301513">Here, Petitioner is a tax-exempt social club.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.827" offset="313007">It is a golf club.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.593" offset="320008">It has operated one of the finest golf courses in Oregon for the past 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.997" offset="341637">In addition to its golf course, it operates a food and beverage business for members and also for non-members whose private parties are sponsored by members.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.573" offset="395972">Virtually all the private party business is categorized as an unrelated business by Section 512(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.596" offset="436096">In the years at issue, this food and beverage unrelated business produced tax losses when... when computed according to a method stipulated by the government to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.189" offset="490431">These losses were used to offset other unrelated business income... unrelated business income from another activity, the investment income.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.497" offset="535675">The government disallowed the deduction which produced the losses on the basis that the food and beverage unrelated activity was not entered into with an intent to earn a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.721" offset="584576">We contend that no profit motive is required because the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms in Section 512(a)(3) do not require a profit motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.629" offset="636194">The resolution of this case, in our view, depends completely on the terms of Section 512(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="129.183" offset="662421">Accordingly, I would like to take a few minutes to analyze the operation of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.039" offset="689797">Section 512(a)(3) of the Code divides the activities of a social club into two parts, and for our convenience today I would like to call these parts categories or baskets.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.429" offset="747371">Section 512(a)(3) creates two categories for the activities of an exemption... social club called the Exempt Category and the Unrelated Business Category.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.070" offset="789899">Section 512(a)(3) then defines which club activities are to go into each category.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.426" offset="823335">Section 512(a)(3)(b) narrowly defines the exempt category to consist of those activities which are member-paid social or recreational goods or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.901" offset="877252">Goods or services that the members pay for; that's the exempt category.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.654" offset="1092292">The tax treatment of the income and deductions of an activity is determined by which category Section 512(a)(3) assigns that particular category.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.128" offset="1138163">The income of an exempt category is exempt, and the deductions... and the expenses are not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.151" offset="1174317">The income of the unrelated business activity is taxable and the deduction... and the expenses are deductible if those expenses are of the type allowed to a business by Chapter 1 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.743" offset="1236592">Now, the government maintains that after Section 512(a)(3) assigned Petitioner's unrelated food and beverage business to the unrelated business category it must then meet a profit motive test under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.289" offset="1306810">However, the profit motive test is generally a precondition to the existence of a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.043" offset="1337843">The existence of a business is a requirement for Section 162 to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.010" offset="1441706">Once the Section 512(a)(3) precondition for an unrelated business are met, it would be contradictory to attempt to apply the profit motive precondition for a Section 162 business.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.530" offset="1667822">And since there is no profit motive requirement in Section 512(a)(3) of the Code, then profit motive is really basically irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.783" offset="4880779">Well, I think the... the practical reason is that in 1969 tax-exempt social clubs were only allowed to have 5 percent of their total gross receipt represented by all active non-member income, including non-member food and beverage income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.747" offset="4960609">So that it really was not a... a major problem in Section... in 1969, the thought that maybe there would be some losses on the non-member side and they would be offset against the... the investment income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.357" offset="5023094">So Congress certainly... there was nothing in the legislative history that indicates that they thought that losses on unrelated business... food and beverage business... should not offset the investment income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.298" offset="6398911">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.667" offset="6412286">In 1969 Congress enacted a provision addressing the tax treatment of the income of social clubs and in that provision Congress treated social clubs differently from other tax-exempt organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.075" offset="6465993">With respect to other tax-exempt organizations, Congress imposed a tax only on the income from an unrelated trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.664" offset="6496295">With respect to social clubs, Congress imposed a tax on all income except for what was called the exempt function income which was primarily the payments from members for the purposes of the club.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.638" offset="6540181">Congress was explicit in the legislative history about the reason for this different treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.709" offset="6564527">With respect to other tax-exempt organizations, the concern was a concern about unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.629" offset="6588142">It was a concern that if a tax-exempt organization engaged in a trade or business in competition with a taxable entity, the tax-exempt organization would have an unfair competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.421" offset="6639342">With respect to social clubs, Congress explicitly stated in the legislative history that there was that concern, but there was another concern as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.442" offset="6671420">And the additional concern had to do with the entire reason for the exemption for social clubs in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.930" offset="6697438">The reason for the exemption for social clubs was so as not to penalize individuals for coming together and pooling their resources for their pleasure and recreation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.321" offset="6738921">But Congress specifically noted, to the extent that outside income was not taxed, it represented a tax subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.642" offset="6768282">And in the words of Congress, such a subsidy would be a distortion of the purpose of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.396" offset="6791270">Well, in the legislative history Congress specifically identified investment income as the kind of income that it sought to tax of social clubs, and it specifically identified the failure to tax investment income as the kind of tax subsidy that it sought to prevent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2631.810" offset="10672857">Now, under Petitioner's plain meaning argument that clearly should be the result because the fees from the non-members are taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.131" offset="10702219">They're gross income, they're not from members, so they're unrelated business taxable income.</text>
