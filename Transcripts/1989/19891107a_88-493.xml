            <text syncTime="1684.119" offset="6878042">In our view, four broad considerations should guide this Court's analysis in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.427" offset="6919211">The first is that privileges, although fostering important relationships, also stand as obstacles to the ascertainment of truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.754" offset="7088589">But the Court, Justice Blackmun, has been reluctant to recognize privileges that have not enjoyed the sanction of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.977" offset="7129445">Second, the recognition of privileges is a well-established function of the judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.467" offset="13931417">It is now very apparent just how narrow this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.519" offset="13947613">We have been given assurances as to the EEOC's procedure, how they do not come with a blunderbuss and how they first carefully examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.160" offset="13994215">That is not at all our experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.845" offset="14008948">But the important point is that the EEOC's procedures and whether they are adequate and whether they really do give protection or not is now at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.652" offset="14048132">Under the Third Circuit's holding, that is not at issue; it's irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.390" offset="14071120">This case must be reversed so that the Third Circuit can consider exactly that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.227" offset="14098392">It has been conceded that confidentiality is a value, but it is asserted that it is trumped here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.381" offset="14123051">All that we are asking is that the inevitable and irrevocable holder of the trump card is not the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.570" offset="14159832">What happened in the Gray case, to which the Solicitor General pointed with pride, is exactly what we're asking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.410" offset="14191178">Not that our final day on these important issues be our adversary, but that it be... that it be a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.931" offset="14225242">Look at what happened to poor little Franklin &amp; Marshall, and this is why redaction... redaction may be the answer in some instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.502" offset="14255544">It is one of several factors that ought to enter into the balance scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.406" offset="14271113">But in the case of Franklin &amp; Marshall, also in the Third Circuit, what the EEOC asked for... I see my time is up.</text>
