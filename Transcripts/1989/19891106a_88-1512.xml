            <text syncTime="116.363" offset="609799">They were registered to do business in Mississippi, they maintained a registered agent there, and they were in fact doing business in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.088" offset="644698">It is clear, therefore, that venue and jurisdiction were appropriate in the Southern District of Mississippi.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="130.250" offset="665387">Mr. Tucker, could the court sitting in Mississippi have declined to grant or allow the transfer?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III</label>
            <text syncTime="138.227" offset="697257">It certainly could have, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.569" offset="706661">And I think that is one of the important things that we want to stress for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.550" offset="722543">It is not our argument in this case that a plaintiff filing a motion under Section 1404 has an absolute right to a transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.968" offset="764234">That is clearly not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.900" offset="775937">We may have a right to file a motion, but the determination of whether or not that case is going to be transferred is to be made by the district court after weighing all of the various factors that are appropriate for consideration under Section 1404.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.651" offset="846990">In fact, in this very case, had the Respondents filed some objection to the motion to transfer, it is conceivable that the court in Mississippi would have denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.677" offset="891085">Had that happened, we would have had a forum in which to try this case, because the Mississippi forum was clearly appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.443" offset="926089">Instead, by asserting the statute of limitations of Pennsylvania after the transfer had occurred, the Respondents have essentially engaged in the practice of using the transfer to defeat the state law advantages accruing to the Plaintiff from its initial selection of the forum, and Van Dusen proscribes that kind of conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.329" offset="1013652">The holding of Van Dusen I don't believe is inconsistent with the result reached by the Third Circuit here.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.324" offset="1045625">Are you, you are saying some of the language is--</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Tucker, III</label>
            <text syncTime="227.167" offset="1053044">I am saying the reasoning in Van Dusen, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.807" offset="1059627">I am not... it is not our position that Van Dusen held that, in this particular case, the law of Mississippi had to continue to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.855" offset="1099751">In fact, the court specifically reserved judgment on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.395" offset="1109887">We are not claiming otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.457" offset="1118141">But it is our belief that the reasoning in Van Dusen is equally applicable in the present case, and that therefore the law of Mississippi should have continued to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.435" offset="1162132">Now, the venue privilege that is accorded to a plaintiff is well established in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.749" offset="1191389">The Judicial Code of 1948 established venue rights for plaintiffs seeking to bring suits in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.603" offset="1222736">Section 1391(c) of the Judicial Code... of that provision, provides broad latitude to plaintiffs seeking to bring suits against defendant corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.905" offset="1287937">Not only is venue appropriate in a district where all the plaintiffs reside, or in the district where the cause of action arose, but venue is also appropriate with respect to corporations in the district where the corporation was incorporated, in any district in which it is licensed to do business, and in any district in which it is in fact doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.170" offset="1381038">Implicit in the provision of broad venue rights to a plaintiff is the recognition that a plaintiff can select law in one of those forms that is more favorable than his selection of another form in the applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.691" offset="1459092">In Van Dusen this Court recognized the propriety of the exercise of the venue privilege and of the accrual of state law advantages that arose because of such a selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.942" offset="1516143">Indeed, this Court specifically deemed those rights worthy of protection against defendants who sought to use Section 1404 to defeat those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.791" offset="1567552">Now, there is nothing about Section 1404 that indicates that it is any way intended to defeat plaintiff's venue privilege and the accrual of advantageous state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.020" offset="1616453">--Your case would have more, perhaps, gut appeal to it if you had kept your so-called venue privilege in Mississippi and not transferred it back to Pittsburgh, where the action... or accident occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.848" offset="1671728">Well, Your Honor, what I am suggesting though is that the applicable law selection is a result of the initial selection of an appropriate venue forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.667" offset="1723033">That's implicit by the way that Section 1391 is phrased.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.183" offset="1745080">Section 1404, which provides for transfers, is not an automatic right.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.256" offset="1773397">It does not provide a plaintiff or a defendant with a right to select a different forum and a different set of laws that will be applicable to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.823" offset="1819686">The law that should be applied in the case is that which is applied as a result of the initial selection of the forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.089" offset="1856675">That is what the venue privilege establishes, that we have a right to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.275" offset="1877469">And nothing in 1404 defeats that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.687" offset="1891052">1404, if you view the specific express language, contains nothing indicating that a transfer of venue should result in a transfer of the applicable law.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.384" offset="2181848">Section 1404's enunciated policy is to provide for the convenience of the parties and witnesses in the interest of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.406" offset="2253945">Finally, in what meager legislative history there is that deals with Section 1404, there is nothing to suggest that it was intended to defeat a plaintiff's venue privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.718" offset="12587255">Well, but Mr. Helwig, here is what troubles me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.919" offset="12603973">I don't see any basis in the text of the statute or anything else for saying that you... federal court has to apply one law where the plaintiff moves, another law where the defendant moves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.888" offset="12647859">I mean, we would be making that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.666" offset="12650994">There is just no basis in there for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.990" offset="12660293">There is a basis in the statute, however, for meeting the problem that you are concerned about in a different fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.774" offset="12683490">That is, for simply saying if somebody has filed in a forum that is an inconvenient forum, and if the affect of transferring it is to send it to... at his instance, is to... at his instance is to send it to a forum where he would not have been able to win had he sued there, the court should not allow the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.995" offset="12760290">You have language that permits that here, it says in the interest of justice a district court may transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.998" offset="12780352">In other words, the decision whether to transfer or not to transfer is very much at the discretion of the court, by... the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.543" offset="12810550">And I feel sort of free to follow my gut feeling which, frankly, is somewhat like yours, that this seems like a, you know, a legally permissible thing, but not the kind of thing we ought to encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.762" offset="12859346">So why... why shouldn't I do it that way rather than by saying yes, you can transfer, but the... but the law that applies is the law of the transferee forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.668" offset="12899052">Well, the first answer to that question is the issue which has been granted... of which review has been granted, is what happens when there is a transfer, not whether or not transfer should be granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.969" offset="13092254">As a pro... but as a matter of common sense, I agree with you, that also would be a desirable prophylactic rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.413" offset="13182011">I am not sure that I see that there, although as a common sense way of dealing with the question, I think it has much to commend it.</text>

I am not saying that the question of choice of law couldn't be taken into consideration under that heading, but I don't think it's going to be entitled to dispositive weight because you do have these other factors which, as in this particular case, everything about the case is back in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.793" offset="13303532">So, it wouldn't... the interest of justice approach wouldn't necessarily compel the district court to deny the transfer motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.469" offset="13458177">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.881" offset="13463924">There are just three points that I would like to touch on very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.083" offset="13476672">Justice Scalia's interest of justice analysis, I think, results in this case in the requirement that the Third Circuit's decision be reversed and this case be remanded to the Western District of Pennsylvania for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.182" offset="13533097">And if the Court adopts the position, or at least the suggestion, that Justice Scalia has indicated from his questioning, I think that that is the appropriate outcome in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.109" offset="13584819">I wanted to address something that Justice Stevens was talking about, asking in terms of what enlargement of rights is there from the transfer of the case from the Southern District of Mississippi back to the Western District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.879" offset="13643856">As Your Honor pointed out, there is no enlargement of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.324" offset="13665694">There is only one benefit to the Plaintiff in this particular case; it is more convenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.297" offset="13685547">And lo and behold, you look at Section 1404 and what does it say, for the convenience of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.320" offset="13713655">The transfer of the case was for the express purposes set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.654" offset="13738941">If you listen to the arguments that are being made by the Respondents, they are all in favor of discouraging plaintiffs from utilizing forums which would be properly available for them under the venue statutes set forth in the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.329" offset="13817622">How are they going to discourage that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.299" offset="13825563">They are going to discourage it by making it inconvenient and expensive for plaintiffs to try cases in those forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.724" offset="13859209">Again, I submit that any argument that fosters an application of Section 1404 against the convenience is--</text>
