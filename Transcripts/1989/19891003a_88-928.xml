            <text syncTime="2419.077" offset="9821712">If the statute said that on its face, and then the IRS issued a summons like this, claiming that it wants to investigate the merits of that deduction, the taxpayer could reasonably come into the summons enforcement court and say, look, there's nothing for them to investigate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.449" offset="11539210">And the two dissenters in that case, Justice Harlan and Justice Fortas, wanted to limit the Court's decision just to the... to cases where there was no contest in the state court, where it was, if not collusive, at least consented or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.880" offset="11592918">And the Court didn't... the majority did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.568" offset="11599605">So, I think at least the agent certainly has very strong reason to think here that he... that he can do it--</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.425" offset="11623116">And, apart from that point, though, I don't want to let slide the fact that the petitioner and the district court have conceded that the statute is not as we said in the hypothetical, that it can be set aside under certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.248" offset="11678391">Now, how likely those conditions are to occur is not something to be determined before we're allowed to make an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.307" offset="11702632">In fact, I think that's most clearly stated in Petitioner's reply brief at page... pages 9 and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.835" offset="11736696">I... I read as a concession that the IRS can issue a summons to the attorney of the estate as a... as a means of conducting an investigation of an attorney's... of the legitimacy of an attorney's fee that has been approved by the surrogate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.344" offset="11810779">That's exactly what it says here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.608" offset="11819765">Now... because of the possibility that there might be fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.951" offset="11837215">Now, what Respondent... I'm sorry, Petitioner's defense, that... that he still maintains, is that that's not applicable in this case because the IRS agent didn't say that he was investigating fraud at the time he issued the summonses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.413" offset="11891027">And so, maybe you can do that in another case, but not in this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.224" offset="11906283">But I think it's clear enough that we don't have to say at the outset of our investigation where the investigation is going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.503" offset="11927390">In fact, we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.377" offset="11934913">And there's no reason to we should be expected to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.970" offset="11945258">The nature of an investigation is that you start looking into a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.249" offset="11958423">As you develop facts, your attention becomes more focused; then you move along and maybe you find fraud, maybe you find that the deduction was perfectly reasonable, or maybe you reach the conclusion that the surrogate made a mistake of New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.574" offset="12011713">But we don't know where it's going to go in the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.508" offset="12019445">To... in order to get an IRS summons enforced, we have to allege a purpose of investigating tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.163" offset="12045986">That was clearly the purpose here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.958" offset="12053196">And that's the end of the case, I think, from that perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.958" offset="12073258">Now, the second issue in the case is one that we have stated in our brief that we don't think the Court needs to reach because... for the reasons I've just discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.546" offset="12111605">I think the summons has to be enforced in any case, no matter... whether Bosch applies or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.280" offset="12126547">But the Court could reach it, and I'd just like to talk about it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.576" offset="12143684">We think it is clear, from the language of the statute, from using the terms allowable under state law, and from the history of the statute from its beginning, that section 20... 2053 does not set up a test of looking at whether the surrogate has, as a historical fact, allowed a particular deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.991" offset="12221320">The idea is to make an inquiry into state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.130" offset="12233858">The reasons for that rule are explained by the court in Bosch, and there is no reason to have a different rule for this particular estate deduction than there is for the marital deduction that was at issue there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.032" offset="12417552">I don't find the Bosch majority, in particularly, crystal clear as to what the rule is or why it's that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.515" offset="12439494">--All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.108" offset="12441793">Well, what I was responding to was... was the argument the Petitioner made that Bosch applies only to the marital deduction, section 2056, and shouldn't apply here to section 2053.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.605" offset="12479827">I think Justice Stevens' point would be that, even in the marital deduction context, Bosch should be given an extremely narrow reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.305" offset="12506577">And, as I say, we disagree with that, but that's something that would be litigated down the road, I think, in... in a refund suit here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.426" offset="12543044">But at least what the Court said in Bosch, I think, is that state law means the law of the highest court, and that the IRS should not be bound by mistakes of state law, of lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.110" offset="12585780">Now, I... I would just like to say that we don't think this is really opening a great Pandora's box and federalism concerns and all this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.637" offset="12627890">The IRS, for reasons that the Court seems to be well aware of, is not likely to go out willy-nilly, disallowing all these fees and bringing them into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.290" offset="12662580">And certainly the district courts are not likely to be second guessing the surrogates willy-nilly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.740" offset="12680343">I think the problem is possible abuses here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.723" offset="12692255">And the district courts aren't going to want to invite this kind of litigation; they're only going to step in and disagree with the surrogate if there's a real problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.284" offset="12722557">And all we want is to be able to conduct an investigation and find out if there is a real problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.609" offset="12739798">Unless there are any questions--</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.715" offset="12780236">I want to respond only to the issue of this so-called inability of the court, under Powell, to look at the merits in determining whether a proper purpose is had by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.644" offset="12855991">It seems to me that Powell said that the hearing on proper purpose ought not to be a meaningless inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.375" offset="12890890">And it is a meaningless inquiry if you can't look at the merits or you have a state court's determination intervening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.169" offset="12926103">Because, in such an instance, the only way that you can judge whether the Internal Revenue Service is doing the right thing is by finding out what they're about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.007" offset="12973437">And in this case, they made it very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.194" offset="12986185">They said they were entitled under Bosch to make a second inquiry; that they could look... as a matter of fact, when they started the case, they said that it isn't determined under state law at all... alone, it's determined under federal standards, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.920" offset="13057029">They only abandoned that position, shall we say, artfully, anyway, in the Second Circuit and in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.590" offset="13083778">But, in fact, what they would have this Court do is impose a federal standard on the surrogate courts and, in effect, on the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.040" offset="13125574">And what happens if you don't find out in the beginning whether they really are interested in fraud and whether, as they said in this case, the only thing they thought they could do is second guess the determination of this surrogate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.361" offset="13182835">You are not following the line of the Powell case, in which the court said that the hearing cannot be meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.562" offset="13219615">And it is meaningless unless you look into the merits of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.919" offset="13237065">If we pick up on the hypothetical, suppose we had a California case in which the executor's commission and the attorney's fee are exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.695" offset="13280115">If the court couldn't inquire into whether or not a proper purpose was had by virtue of the Internal Revenue Service issuing a summons in that case, then the inquiry would, indeed, be a meaningless one.</text>
