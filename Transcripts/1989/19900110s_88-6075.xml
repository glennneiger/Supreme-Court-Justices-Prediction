            <text syncTime="6.973" offset="115361">This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.265" offset="140543">The impeachment exception to the exclusionary rule have permits the prosecution in a criminal proceeding to introduce evidence illegally obtained from the defendant to impeach the defendant’s own testimony if he takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.531" offset="213686">The Illinois Supreme Court extended this exception, in this case, to permit the prosecution to introduce evidence illegally obtained from the defendant to impeach the testimony not only of the defendant who takes the stand, but also of other witnesses who testify for the defense whether or not the defendant takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.038" offset="307623">The Supreme Court reasoned that in order to deter the defendant from engaging in perjury by proxy, the impeachment exception to the exclusionary rule ought to be expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.117" offset="359972">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.755" offset="366555">We hold that this extension is inconsistent with a balance of values underlying our previous applications of the exclusionary rule expansion of the exceptions would significantly weaken the exclusionary rules to deter effect and police misconduct by enhancing the expected value to the prosecution of an illegally obtained evidence by deterring defendants from calling witnesses in the first place and thereby keeping exculpatory evidence from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.779" offset="490584">When police officers confront opportunities to obtain illegal evidence, excluding such evidence from only the prosecution’s case in chief, would lead officer with little to lose and much to gain by overstepping the constitutional limits on evidence gathered.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.581" offset="561846">Accordingly, the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion filed this day with the Clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.211" offset="608344">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices O’Connor and Scalia have joined.</text>
