            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Ivan Pasek</label>
            <text syncTime="13.308" offset="173602">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.093" offset="184783">The issue in this case is whether Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.448" offset="222190">The proceedings here began with a complaint filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County under the Illinois Human Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.284" offset="249462">Because there was no attempt made to exhaust administrative remedies under Illinois law, Yellow Freight filed a motion to dismiss that complaint for lack of jurisdiction and the plaintiff sought leave to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.760" offset="295437">An agreed order was entered under which the state law complaint was dismissed with prejudice and the motion for leave to amend was continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.183" offset="329083">Five days later Yellow Freight filed a removal petition and the Federal district court eventually granted leave to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.587" offset="354683">Yellow Freight filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that any filing by Colleen Donnelly was ineffective because Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Title VII claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.577" offset="402644">The parties have agreed in this case that the law governing this was set forth by the Court in Gulf Offshore and recently reapplied by the Court in its Taflin decision, that the presumption in favor of concurrent jurisdiction is a rebuttable one and that it may be rebutted either explicitly or implicitly, explicitly by statutory directive, which is not present in this case, or from the unmistakable implication from legislative history, or by demonstration of a clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and the Federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.949" offset="532211">We submit that the touchstone for this inquiry is congressional intent and that the Court must examine facts such as the language structure and legislative history of the act in order to determine whether Congress intended to confer exclusive jurisdiction on Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.641" offset="590935">When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was adopted, it was against a background of debate over state's rights, and the compromise model which Congress eventually settled on initiated with a model patterned after the National Labor Relations Act which had cease and desist powers and which would have provided for appeals to the circuit courts of appeals and no resort at all to the trial courts of general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.174" offset="685080">Under such a model, consistent with this Court's decision in the Garner case, there would have been exclusive Federal jurisdiction over those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.862" offset="715800">Thus, it is not surprising that when the promoters of the bill accepted a compromise of private suits for Title VII violations, they presumed that those suits would be brought in the Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.820" offset="763656">There is thus no reference in the legislative history that the new rights which were being created would be enforceable in the state courts, and it was the common understanding that the enforcement was to be in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.712" offset="807228">Representative McCollouch, for example, who was the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, noted that there were several members of the committee who preferred that the ultimate determination of discrimination rests with the Federal judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.787" offset="2311464">I submit that's about as precise as you can expect someone to be that the intention was that these cases be brought in the Federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.242" offset="2349289">You couple those legislative assertions with the carefully ordered sequential procedure that I referred to in response to Justice O'Connor's question and it would be inconceivable to think that the sponsors of this legislation who had agreed to the compromise, were presuming that state courts had any role in the enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.490" offset="2430373">This is reinforced by several procedural mechanisms which Congress built into the statute which have application only in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.929" offset="2464123">And as this Court suggests in its Taflin decision, the inclusion of such provisions is a suggestion that Congress did intend exclusive Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.851" offset="2503725">Start, for example, with the provisions of Section 706(j) which provide that any civil action under this section shall be subject to appeal as provided in Sections 1291 and 1292 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.075" offset="2552626">Now, that provision applies only to the cases that can be taken to the Federal courts of appeals, and those are only cases which arise out of the Federal district courts or thorough the administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.567" offset="2602677">I'm not aware of any case in which Congress has specified specific reference to Sections 1291 and 1292 which involve concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.858" offset="2643846">The Seventh Circuit characterized that as merely a grant of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.409" offset="2657952">If that were so, it would be an unnecessary statement by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.361" offset="2673834">And further, Sections 1291 and 1292 carry some important baggage with them over what constitutes an appealable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.450" offset="2702151">That might be very different under state court systems under which a number of orders which would be characterized as interlocutory and not appealable by this Court could be appealed directly in a state court system, thereby staying proceedings and thereby interfering with the congressional goal of seeking the rapid adjudication of these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.356" offset="3141739">I'm only aware of a few instances in which Congress has ever done that, and all of those statutes are ones in which Congress has at the same time set forth that the jurisdiction is to be exclusively Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.313" offset="3185625">For example, you have that in the Natural Gas Act, you have that in the Federal Power Act and in the Connelly Hot Oil Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.567" offset="3210598">I believe those are the only examples I could find in which, other than Title VII, the Congress has specified the 1291 and 1292 procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.823" offset="3247692">In addition, you have the Federal interest in uniformity which might be compromised here because of the possible litigation of these claims in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.214" offset="3289175">Congress was clear to spell out that the injunctive relief would be issued pursuant to Rule 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.117" offset="3312789">Rule 65 contains with it specified procedures which protect the interests of the respondents as well as the persons claiming to be aggrieved and there may not be an analog in the state court system for the grant of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.894" offset="3375901">Therefore, you could have a system under which restraining orders would be granted or denied and the result would depend not on the case but simply upon which the court the... the action had been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.785" offset="3423548">There is no basis in the legislative history whatsoever to suggest that Congress was attempting to regulate the procedures of the state courts when it included these provisions in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.058" offset="3464613">Similarly, there are provisions of the statute dealing with the time table of the cases, the assignment to individual judges, the expedition of proceedings, the use of magistrates pursuant to Rule 53, under which Congress carefully prescribed certain procedures to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.454" offset="3542144">Now, those procedures were part of the compromise that Congress settled on.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.775" offset="3563460">A number of those procedures came in with the final consideration of the Dominick amendment where Senator Dominick stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="867.362" offset="3589792">"Despite voluminous rhetoric to the contrary, my convictions that U.S. District Court enforcement provides employees and potential employees with the fairest, most effective redress of their grievances remains unshaken. "</text>
            <text syncTime="880.486" offset="3642350">The biggest argument against court enforcement at the time was the delay, and Senator Dominick sought to remedy that and to assuage the opponents of the court enforcement system by incorporating the procedural provisions, such as assigning the case to an individual district court judge for an expedited hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.400" offset="3713926">Now, the compromise between the proponents of the court enforcement and the cease and desist models is an essential part of this legislation.</text>

Gulf Offshore and recently, five weeks ago, in Taflin, namely that three-prong approach, does the statute itself express that state court shall not have jurisdiction, which we don't have here, and then, secondly, a look at legislative intent and, thirdly, a look at the nature of the Federal law and whether or not it's incompatible with being heard by the state courts, I have to address what counsel for Yellow Freight calls the touchstone of their argument, namely that there is legislative intent here from the congressional debates that the sovereign power of state courts to hear Federal cases, which is rooted in our Federal system, is removed by an examination of intent from what certain senators or congressmen said or didn't say in a bill such as Title VII, which, frankly, was... it was amended 87 times in 83 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.880" offset="5159855">This Court made some observations in the Kremer decision which indicates concurrent state court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.033" offset="5184515">For example, one of the original proposals in the Title VII debates was that those states... and at the time half of the states had their own Fair Employment Practices laws... those states which had FEP laws, the jurisdiction of Title VII would not apply to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.430" offset="5262046">It follows from that that if that were the enactment of Title VII, certainly there would be... have to be concurrent state court jurisdiction with regard to fair employment practices laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.822" offset="5303633">There are statements with regard to... by Senator Humphrey that this employment of Title VII here is to implement and broaden rather than supplant the existing state court laws and procedures for adjudicating employment practices complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.199" offset="5381165">The language and the set-up of... of the statute itself, with the interplay between EEOC and the involvement of state court agencies right in the statute, in my view, suggests an attempt to involve the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.030" offset="5468518">And if we're going to involve the states, it makes sense to involve the judicial power of the states as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.603" offset="5714801">It is suggested that one of the implications from the fact that Congress put procedural requirements in Title VII, mentioning appeals to Federal courts, mentioning injunctions, mentioning expedited assignment to a district court judge or, if he can't hear it, then to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.532" offset="5802468">There were issues in... in the RICO Taflin case regarding procedures... nationwide service, venue, et cetera... which certainly were not a stumbling block to a finding that since Congress has not excluded the state courts from jurisdiction under RICO, state courts have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.571" offset="5926601">Going back to Claflin, hundred-year-ago decision, but the reading of it makes some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.075" offset="5956695">Mr. Justice Bradley, in deciding an issue of concurrent jurisdiction arising out of the bankruptcy laws of 1867, relies very heavily on Alexander Hamilton's Number 82 Federalist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.251" offset="6009357">That was written one year before the Judicial Act, and Hamilton sets forth his ideas of Federalism as applied to the judicial power and concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.292" offset="6061498">And Hamilton says that, because of the supremacy clause, the Federal courts... the Federal legislature, Congress, can exclude state court jurisdiction basically in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.936" offset="6132133">One, by just expressing it in the statute or, secondly, by implication arising out of an incompatibility with the Federal enactment and its being decided with state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.478" offset="6178317">He makes no mention of taking a look at legislative intent by way of history, maybe just because it was brand new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.869" offset="6219800">But Mr. Justice Bradley in Claflin does not suggest that a look at legislative history gives us a clear answer to the question of whether or not there is incompatibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.796" offset="6279568">And in reviewing this issue and the work involved, in... in having a principle upon which we're going to decide whether or not in future cases there is exclusive jurisdiction or there is concurrent jurisdiction, and in looking at the fact that the Federal courts who have decided the question in this case have had different opinions on it, reasonable men can differ as to whether or not there is unmistakable implication in the legislative intent not expressed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.802" offset="6423555">And it seems to me that if there is a look at legislative intent, it must be tied into the basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.539" offset="6450513">What is the basis of Congress intending to remove state court jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.728" offset="6479248">What is the reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.994" offset="6488339">The answer has to be that there is some basic incompatibility between our Federal enactment here, this law, and it being decided by state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.838" offset="6547689">One of the district courts who held concurrent jurisdiction in here in Indiana sent a law clerk to look through 55 titles of the Federal Code and found out that 72 times Congress had expressly divested states from concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.401" offset="6629922">They... they know how to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.160" offset="6805047">My final suggestion is that absolutely no harm is done to the Federal purpose of Title VII or to the parties in any Title VII issue if state court concurrent jurisdiction is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.658" offset="6891042">A plaintiff may choose Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.477" offset="6906298">Or, if he chooses state court, a defendant may remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.715" offset="6931271">Any peculiarly strategic advantages of the Federal court are preserved to either plaintiff or defendant under concurrent jurisdiction, whereas, if exclusive jurisdiction is found, we have problems because of preclusion, that if issues of discrimination are adjudicated by a state court, the Federal courts will apply res judicata notwithstanding the fact that in the state court the plaintiff could not have Title VII as the basis of his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.256" offset="7089364">For all of those reasons, I urge the Court to affirm the Seventh Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.148" offset="7132936">Yes, I do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.616" offset="7154879">First, with regard to Taflin, this Court recognized that Congress could proceed, assuming exclusive Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.539" offset="7190510">And given the start with the NLRB model and then the move to the trial court litigation model without any mention of the state courts, we submit it shows just that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.846" offset="7235754">The involvement of the states that Mr. Henely talked about was specifically worked out by the reference to state agencies, but it was under state law where the states were to have any role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.504" offset="7282357">In Section 706(c) Congress specifically talks about resort to the states, the initially instituting a proceeding with the state or local agency under state law, not under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.979" offset="7332303">Where Congress wanted the states to be involved with this statute, which touched so deeply on issues of state rights versus Federal rights, it knew how to provide for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.471" offset="7382249">You... you asked the question, Your Honors, about whether or not the United States had ever taken a position on this issue, and indeed it has, before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.291" offset="7413491">In United States v. Minnick, the Solicitor General filed a brief with this Court in 1981 arguing in favor of exclusive jurisdiction of Federal courts to hear Title VII claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.301" offset="7469602">Finally, with respect to the issue of preclusion, I'm surprised that a plaintiff would be in favor of having concurrent jurisdiction because it is a nearly universal rule, as Justice Kennedy noted in his Eichman case on the Ninth Circuit, a nearly universal principle that preclusion will apply only if the first court rendering the decision had jurisdiction over the second claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.785" offset="7571480">So that if you have concurrent jurisdiction, a plaintiff could indeed be claim-precluded, having litigated in the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.606" offset="7710765">And Congress was careful here and concerned that, because of its distrust of the states in this area that the reference to the states was through the administrative procedure and was for a very narrow period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.683" offset="7767085">And I would submit that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.966" offset="7772205">Well, you really have to gather something out of the legislative history other than a desire to make... to make a... the Federal courts available to a plaintiff and to have an expeditious procedure available for the plaintiff in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.478" offset="7834272">You have to go on and say that... that that's the only judicial system that the plaintiff may choose.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Ivan Pasek</label>
            <text syncTime="1936.381" offset="7865932">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.083" offset="7868649">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.033" offset="7872515">And where there is that exclusive jurisdiction, then the plaintiff will not be claim precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.856" offset="7903757">Now, the plaintiff could still be issue precluded, as this Court held in Kremer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.391" offset="7925909">The result of that case was no discrimination and... and the Court was... was required to dismiss based upon the New York state proceedings affirmed by a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.116" offset="7964779">But if... if there is a concurrent jurisdiction, then the plaintiffs presumably would be precluded more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.103" offset="7992783">Finally, Your Honors, with respect to that issue, there will be parallel litigation and there will be parallel litigation whether you choose to have concurrent jurisdiction or exclusively Federal jurisdiction because at the state level the overwhelming majority of the states... I believe all except three... have adopted statutes which contain discrimination provisions and discrimination remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.253" offset="8097377">The overwhelming majority of those states provide for jurisdiction through a cease and desist type administrative agency similar to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.376" offset="8137919">So, if you say that plaintiffs can bring their claims in state courts, there can then be a Title VII claim proceeding in the state court and a parallel proceeding under the state administrative law, where the state administrative agency has no jurisdiction to consider the Title VII claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.439" offset="8214092">The advantage, consistent with the congressional intent of providing for exclusive jurisdiction, is that the states can serve Federalism's interests by trying to resolve the discrimination complaints under state law and the Federal claims can be heard in Federal court where, under the Dominick amendment, the claims were required to be heard.</text>
