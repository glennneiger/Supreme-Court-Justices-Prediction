            <text syncTime="310.497" offset="1376897">But I think the only thing that the Court could decide were the facts that were before the Court at that time, and those were discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.984" offset="1402810">Your Honor, that is precisely the question that is before this Court, as to whether those factors that were constitutionally impermissible in Branti and Elrod are constitutionally impermissible in the benefits of employment we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.427" offset="1468639">The Seventh Circuit held that those claiming recall from layoff, that they were not recalled from layoff when they should have been due to their political affiliation, should be remanded under Elrod and Branti.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.455" offset="1536662">The court then held that as to Petitioners Rutan and Taylor, their denial of promotion and denial of transfer should be remanded to see if it reached the level of constructive discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.465" offset="1592773">And then the court outright held there was no cause of action whatsoever for the man seeking the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.619" offset="1617328">We have approached this case in the traditional First Amendment analysis, and the respondents have failed to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.308" offset="1648152">Before going into that analysis, I would like to point out a few things that I think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.594" offset="1669259">The first is that there is no dispute that a person has the right not to affiliate with a particular party and has the right not to support a particular candidate or to support particular beliefs under the First Amendment, that that is protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.305" offset="1740103">There also has been no suggestion at any point along the way that the jobs in question in this case fall under Branti, that is, the confidential policy making exception which was first talked about in Elrod and then further delineated in Branti.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.719" offset="1821710">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals admitted that what had happened to the petitioners and cross-respondents was coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.459" offset="1864760">The respondents have used the words intrusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.161" offset="1879493">And yet, throughout this litigation from the very beginning the Respondents have offered no compelling reason as to why such coercion, or such intrusion, should be allowed to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.023" offset="1943022">If we go back to the traditional First Amendment analysis, we start with the conduct in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.629" offset="1985445">The conduct in question in this case is the right not to affiliate or not to associate or not to support particular political ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.353" offset="2024315">And that is protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.836" offset="2034242">The very coercion that this Court found existed in Elrod exists in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.459" offset="2064753">The purpose of this system is to force the person to affiliate with the party by voting in the primary, or to contribute money or to do volunteer work if they wish to get the promotion or the transfer or the job itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.171" offset="2135597">The sponsorship that was found to be offensive in Branti is present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.407" offset="2164541">The form used in Sangamon County requires the recommendation or endorsement of the precinct committeemen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.417" offset="5700580">I would like to start by reframing the issue as stated by Mrs. Leahy, and as contained in the complaint which Judge Baker dismissed and which the court of appeals en banc affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.450" offset="5796711">The alleged system is not a strictly partisan political system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.656" offset="5837462">The system in Illinois that is alleged in this complaint is consistent with the Illinois personnel code, which Justice O'Connor asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.498" offset="5896916">That code was and still is in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.033" offset="5918964">Under that personnel code, any applicant for a job, promotion, transfer or... not rehire, but job, promotion or transfer must be tested and evaluated, evaluated by superiors in case of promotions, tested by the applicable agency in case of a new hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.816" offset="6006108">With respect to new hires, the personnel code requires that the persons who take the test are listed in a group from the highest-ranking group, or they can... you can take the three highest on the list of... passed the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.360" offset="6080296">And promotions must be made from a list of qualified employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.681" offset="6097641">All of the people who were hired or promoted under the system alleged in the complaint qualified under the Illinois personnel code, and it is not alleged to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.608" offset="6157305">But the code allows play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.160" offset="6171515">There is play in the code within those qualified people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.344" offset="6188234">And what it allows is that the persons who are at the heads of the department or the hiring authority may select among those qualified, persons who are recommended, persons who are political supporters, or persons who are friends of those who recommend and are political supporters, so that we start out with the underlying proposition that the Illinois personnel code is not in anyway defeated or diminished by this system and that no one who is not qualified for a job or a promotion has been hired or promoted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2886.849" offset="11682307">That is a rule that can be clearly understood by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.717" offset="11697772">If there is not political hiring and if the office is administered in an even-handed manner, there isn't going to be litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.740" offset="11733821">We have looked at the circuits, the Second, the Third, the Eleventh and the D.C. circuits that have adopted this kind of rule of law, and there has not been that increase in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.048" offset="11783035">We submit that the possibilities are far more in the area of race or sex discrimination, and yet no one would suggest to this Court, at least I hope not, that, if a person is denied a job because of their sex or because of their race, that they have not stated a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.080" offset="11871225">The possibility is far more in terms of litigation in those two areas than it is in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.352" offset="11916260">We submit that the state of law as it is under the Seventh Circuit requires far more litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.172" offset="11947607">The Seventh Circuit has held that you do have a cause of action if you are harassed for your political affiliation, but you only have a cause of action for failure to promote if it reaches the level of constructive discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.147" offset="11995463">But in the harassment claim you don't have to reach the level of constructive discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.217" offset="12011764">That is asking the courts to litigate not only the protected right, but then does it reach the level of constructive discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.537" offset="12041021">It does not give sound guidance to the employer who has to make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.858" offset="12062337">We are asking this Court to hold that political affiliation, which was considered constitutionally impermissible in discharge, that those factors are constitutionally impermissible in denial of these very important public benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.689" offset="12141644">The Court has repeatedly... it was explained in Perry, in Elrod, in Branti.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.442" offset="12168603">The principles were reaffirmed in Connick, they were reaffirmed in McPherson v. Rankin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.644" offset="12189501">Those principles of law are good, and they should apply in this case.</text>
