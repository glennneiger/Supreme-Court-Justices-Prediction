            <text syncTime="36.387" offset="283092">The issue in this case is whether equitable recoupment can confer jurisdiction on a district court to hear a taxpayer's suit against the United States for a tax refund when that suit is otherwise barred as untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.631" offset="340143">The short answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.832" offset="348920">Equitable recoupment is a defensive doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.415" offset="359265">Its logic operates to reduce a claim, a currently owed claim or debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.854" offset="393015">It operates in litigation about the amount of that claim, litigation over which a court already has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.044" offset="421750">Equitable recoupment must operate in this way because an equitable doctrine cannot expand the jurisdiction of a district court beyond its statutory limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.983" offset="461560">Here, Sections 7422 and 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code make it clear that no suit for a tax refund may be maintained against the United States unless a refund claim for that tax has been timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.509" offset="523627">The refund claim for the gift tax at issue here was untimely, and nothing in the doctrine of equitable recoupment changes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.365" offset="551004">The dispute... this dispute began because of the tax treatment of a lump sum payment received by the respondent in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.519" offset="583709">At that time, she was serving as the administrator of her former employer's estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.047" offset="645776">A gift tax return was filed and the respondent paid a gift tax of approximately $20,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.337" offset="7658922">The area of disagreement, and it's a big area, a tremendous area, is that tax... that by going to the tax court that Frances Dalm gave up her substantive right of equitable recoupment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.549" offset="7727781">The areas of agreement are that by virtue of a 1926 law, which was a statute enacted before this Court determined the Bull case, that the tax court decisions become final as to the taxes brought before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.426" offset="7799252">We agree with that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.976" offset="7809492">We further agree with the government's proposition that the tax court lacked jurisdiction over the doctrine of equitable recoupment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.866" offset="7841048">Now, with that it seems to me the issue comes right into focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.020" offset="7857662">And the issue is may a taxpayer be denied a hearing of a substantive right by going to the tax court which had no jurisdiction to hear it on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.541" offset="7995797">And that's... that's... they are not treating it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.443" offset="8007395">What they are saying... and the only way I can illustrate it would be as if Congress had enacted a law that provided that the only way any of us could... could contest a government deficiency would be to pay the tax and then go to the tax court or the court... or the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.439" offset="8087330">And that means only the extremely rich would ever be able to hear... have a hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.193" offset="8114393">And that is exactly where their argument leads us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.997" offset="8129544">And that is not true because this is a cause of action that this court has held is a right, a fundamental right, and protected by due process.</text>
