            <text syncTime="71.589" offset="413091">The issue before you today is may the police officers seize an object not listed on a warrant when it is in play view.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.596" offset="449140">And I would start with when a seizure is made without inadvertence it is not made pursuant to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.741" offset="485711">Excuse me, it is not a plain-view seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.303" offset="495951">It is made, in fact, pursuant to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.887" offset="506296">So, we really don't even have a plain-view seizure here.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.437" offset="520507">There is... and the facts in this case are, the police officers procured a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.522" offset="548823">When they did so, they carelessly forgot to include all the items for which they intended to seize.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.207" offset="575573">When they entered the premises, they searched for the items irregardless of the fact that they were not listed in the warrant and, in fact, found the items that they were looking for, except for the items in fact listed on the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.008" offset="630743">In order to find that inadvertence is not required in this situation, this Court would have to overrule Marron v. U.S. The facts there are indistinguishable from the facts here.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.976" offset="742652">When they went in the closet in which they believed the liquor might be, they found ledgers and bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.181" offset="763445">That court, seeing the issue which... as simple as it actually is... said that the ledger and bills were in fact not seized... not listed in the warrant and, therefore, not subject to seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.701" offset="809525">What the Attorney General of California asks this Court to do is to create a new exception to the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.805" offset="841917">The carelessness exception, the... Oh, my goodness, I forgot to get the warrant... particularly describing the items to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.203" offset="875563">What that would do, it would nullify the particularity requirement of the warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.003" offset="7146727">Sure, I'm assuming probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.415" offset="7152369">To ensure that the scope of the search will be to the greatest extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.398" offset="7168356">The purpose of the inadvertence requirement as announced in Coolidge was to enforce two distinct purposes of the warrant clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.235" offset="7211720">To eliminate altogether searches without probable cause and to limit the scope of searches deemed necessary to the smallest extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.472" offset="7252575">Neither of those purposes was violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.044" offset="7270965">The police obtained a valid warrant for three rings, particularly described rings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.978" offset="7294685">They confined the scope of their search to the area and time authorized by the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.641" offset="7317254">They had a lawful basis to be where they could see the other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.397" offset="7344317">There was no general search in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.709" offset="7361558">In fact, I would point out to the Court that the facts show that there were a number of other firearms that were found in the premises that were not seized because they did not fit the description in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.702" offset="7445568">I think it's useful to examine Coolidge in its historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.461" offset="7488618">At the time of Coolidge the Court was deeply divided over two issues, the broad scope of searches incident to arrest and the allowance of searches... of arrests in the home without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.581" offset="7545042">Hence, the basis for... hence, the basis for the citation to Trupiano in Coolidge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.825" offset="7570015">Neither of those concerns are present anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.900" offset="7590286">In Chimel v. California the scope of searches was limited to a small extent to the reaching area of the defendant, and in Payton v. New York, the Court required a warrant for an arrest in a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.680" offset="7649427">Therefore, there is no danger of the police planning to arrest someone, waiting until he goes into his home, and then permitting them to make a very broad search without any warrant whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.807" offset="7701986">In our view, the probable cause requirement protects Petitioner's interest in the possession of these items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.715" offset="7745558">Unlike an unlawful search, the rupture of privacy cannot be repaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.739" offset="7773666">But property can be restored to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.344" offset="7800102">If the police are required to return for a warrant, Petitioner's interest in possession would still be interfered with to the same degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.940" offset="7842525">Stationing an officer to guard the property from loss or destruction while the warrant is sought means that Petitioner would still be deprived of possession or use of that item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.659" offset="7885365">And, in fact, if stationing an officer there is required in order to guard, then the privacy intrusion would be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.424" offset="7920474">It seems an odd way to protect the Petitioner's rights to extend the intrusion on his privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.978" offset="7950671">In Texas v. Brown, the Court indicated some concern with a pretext search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.206" offset="7999573">If that is the case, the Court ought to meet it squarely rather than through use of the inadvertence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.231" offset="8031651">The Coolidge requirement does not apply to contraband, stolen property or items dangerous in themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.819" offset="8066028">Therefore, many pretext searches are not even included in the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.910" offset="8090374">Second of all, if inadvertence is to mean the lack of probable cause, then an officer who obtains a warrant to search for evidence of crime "a" purely as a pretext to look for evidence of crime "b", would not be deterred because if there was no probable cause for the evidence of crime "b", the seizure would be inadvertent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.063" offset="8731001">The courts are simply not equipped to make such determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.076" offset="8747093">The inadvertence rule punishes the police for oversight or miscalculation of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.154" offset="8787321">The error in this case is benign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.484" offset="8800696">It's not deliberate, it's not pretextual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.657" offset="8809369">The Court has said that the police do not have to guess at their peril the precise moment when probable cause exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.421" offset="8840402">The inadvertence rule places the police in just such peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.056" offset="8859001">In this case, the police were properly on the premises and they had probable cause for their seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.391" offset="8900275">We would submit that under those circumstances there simply is no basis to suppress the evidence.</text>

            <label>Ms. Juliana Drous</label>
            <text syncTime="2240.647" offset="9089297">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.905" offset="9090342">First of all, Mr. Kaye starts reading from the record at page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.040" offset="9114897">However, immediately before that, on page 27, the question,</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.824" offset="9134018">"When you went to that residence, what were you looking for? "</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.345" offset="9144154">Answer,</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.856" offset="9146139">"I was looking for items that were from Mr. Wallaker during the robbery itself. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.989" offset="9162649">"I was looking for items that would connect the person at the home to associate with the robbery, things used in the robbery to obtain the property, weapons, so forth, clothing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.076" offset="9199011">Clearly, we are not talking about here about going into police intentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.389" offset="9216252">We are going into what the police actually did, the conduct of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.643" offset="9233284">In this case it is very easy to ascertain in that the police themselves testified as to what they did, that when they went in, they searched for these other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.967" offset="9270587">Second of all, regarding the suggestion that the remedy here of allowing the police to secure the premises while the... while they would go and get the proper corrected warrant, that would not be a remedy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.178" offset="9335475">Segura... when you look at the facts in Segura in which this Court allowed the securing of private premises in order to obtain a warrant, that is... also, they don't say... I don't believe the words were ever used, but in fact, it's good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.597" offset="9389078">And that case the... it was at a late hour, a magistrate was not available to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.269" offset="9411857">The implication is that the police were worried about losing the evidence and that fairly somewhat quick action had to be taken so they went and secured the premises and then got a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.438" offset="9460445">That is good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.800" offset="9465982">Again, when you come to this case, there is no good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.803" offset="9481969">What there is is police negligence, police carelessness, and police officers should not be allowed to an... extend an intrusion which was the result of their own mistake, their own carelessness, their own deliberate disregard of the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.786" offset="9561904">Secondly, although we do not have the facts in this case, it is correct that the inadvertence requirement covers two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.803" offset="9613940">One where there is a warrant and items are seized that are not listed in the warrant and, second, where there is an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.539" offset="9640898">The difference between Payton... Payton would not cover the situation because in Payton you have an arrest warrant allowing the entry into the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.944" offset="9670469">What Coolidge talks about... I'm sorry, there's no... what Payton says is that you cannot enter a home without an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.850" offset="9706100">The situation that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.143" offset="9735357">That's... that's Payton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.444" offset="9740477">However, there is nothing in Payton to protect individuals from police officers obtaining an arrest warrant in order... allowing them to go into the home to arrest the individual and waiting for an opportune time when they have a feeling that evidence might be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.678" offset="9817486">And that's where inadvertence is still necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.169" offset="9827413">In that situation, in order to protect Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.252" offset="9847788">In this case, we do not have a simple oversight or miscalculation of probable cause by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.362" offset="9900138">What we have is out and out forgetfulness, carelessness in not listing... that... that is the only explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.037" offset="9934933">In fact, that's the explanation given in the court as to why the items were not listed on the warrant, were not... why the affidavit did not request that the court include those items in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.444" offset="9980490">And what you do have here... in fact, you do have a general search if a general search is defined as going in and searching for everything that the police want to look for, and that is not allowed by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.594" offset="10033153">The inadvertence requirement is necessary to protect Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
