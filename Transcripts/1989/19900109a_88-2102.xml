            <text syncTime="235.012" offset="1086348">He has testified that he buys these rights for himself and for clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.287" offset="1107455">The district court, in this case, granted summary judgment for the defendants, relying upon the 1977 decision of Judge Friendly in the Rohauer case, which Judge Friendly described as a case of first impression on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.986" offset="1170254">A Ninth Circuit panel, by a split decision, reversed the district court's summary judgment in this case, and so we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.934" offset="1218005">Both circuits, however, it's important to note, acknowledge that a reconciliation of these competing copyrights was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.740" offset="1253218">I will plan to explain why the Second Circuit's accommodation of these competing interests best resolves the competing copyright interests and policies, and why the Ninth Circuit's accommodation in this case was flawed and will result in a defeating of the policies and purposes of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.696" offset="1341094">Under the Second Circuit's approach as to the prior work... when the prior author dies and his statutory successor renews the copyright, the court would effect the second-chance policy of Section 24 in favor of authors by providing that all of the rights given to the derivative work owner lapse or revert and go back to the statutory successor of the prior work, with one important exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.014" offset="1466378">The owner of the derivative work would continue to have the right to exploit that derivative work which was made under license during the first term and authorized by Section 7 and would only be able to continue to exploit that work according to the limits placed on him or her by that original assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.630" offset="1560836">This effecting of the policy actually gives the statutory successor even more than what the author would have had had he survived and renewed because, under the decision of this Court in Fred Fisher, if the author had lived three more months and had renewed the copyright in this case, as the assignment that he previously had given, would have given the movie owners the rights to continue to distribute the movie but, more importantly, to make additional motion pictures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.329" offset="11399596">But I am saying that for the studios to say that they reasonably relied on Rohauer, when the premier authority in the field said that it was plainly wrong, I think that someone should think twice about how much reliance they actually did put on Rohauer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.088" offset="11458632">Furthermore, Rohauer involved the showing of a preexisting print that was made... they made one videotape copy and then showed that preexisting print over a public television station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.567" offset="11508578">What the petitioners have done here is made several thousand new 35-millimeter print versions of the film, and made several hundred thousand new videotape copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.458" offset="11556121">Each time they made a new copy that was an infringement of a separate and different right than the one that was involved in Rohauer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.460" offset="11580154">So to say that the studios could reasonably rely on Rohauer, which was referred to as unconvincing within two years by the Ninth Circuit... by the way, also in 1977 in the Register's report, it called Rohauer one of the biggest surprises under the 1909 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.241" offset="11651311">When you have the Register saying it's a surprise; when you have Rohauer carefully noting that only one videotape was made and it was a preexisting print, for the studios then to march out boldly making thousands and thousands of new copies, distributing works in videotape form and otherwise going far beyond Rohauer, then I think that their just... their reliance on Rohauer is clearly not justified.</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.124" offset="11834796">There is no doubt that some provisions of the renewal... excuse me... some of the renewal provisions are confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.949" offset="11862067">It wasn't until within the last year that a district court squarely dealt with the issue of what happens if an author, at the beginning of the 27th year, renews the copyright and then dies and then someone else comes in... his statutory successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.899" offset="11921940">So there... it's clear... and that I think was the kind of uncertainty that was left open to construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.775" offset="11957362">But as far as this issue goes, I think the Registrar hit the nail on the head when, in the brief, they say that this case presents a straightforward interpretation of Fred Fisher and Miller Music.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.865" offset="12013787">The petitioners' counsel has attempted to explain Rohauer, or to justify it by saying that what it does is it gives effect to the consent of the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.777" offset="12077421">And the problem... and it limits the new uses, or the continued use to that consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.192" offset="12103125">Well, there are several problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.692" offset="12113052">And the first one is that you can read Rohauer and you will never find the Court itself expressing that opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.760" offset="12485349">The point that I was about to make was that in the district court, the petitioners said that there was no limit in Rohauer that prevented the petitioners from making remakes of their... of their film.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.140" offset="12554835">When we came back and said that that would... has blown Rohauer completely into... into new abuses, they back-pedaled and said: Well, what Rohauer was really trying to effect was limiting the new uses to the scope of the consent that was given by the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.173" offset="12622962">And there are some substantial problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.273" offset="12635396">Mr. Woolrich consented to... if Mr. Woolrich consented to remakes, why is it that Petitioners can't make remakes, if the point of Rohauer is that it gives effect to his consent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.662" offset="12680954">If, as Petitioners now state, that it's limited by the extent to which they exercised their rights... well, they never exercised the right to make videotape copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.161" offset="12730900">But now they've made millions of dollars exploiting videotape copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.314" offset="12747514">So it's very, very difficult to find out intellectually where Rohauer ends and where you... what effect you give to the consent of the author, assuming that you want to give any effect to it in light of the Court's holding in Miller Music.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.158" offset="12826926">The other problem with Rohauer is that it gives no compensation at all to the owners of the statutory... the owners of the renewal copyrights and books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.755" offset="12869349">The petitioners have said that my client received the rights to the renewal copyright for $650.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.822" offset="12901636">The actual transaction was that he was going to share with the trust... excuse me... created by Mr. Woolrich's Will, 10 percent of all monies generated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.260" offset="12955344">This is a transaction that Chase Manhattan Bank handled as the trustee... that they're very happy with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.247" offset="12999334">The main point that I would like to make, though, is that this is not a case between Jimmy Stewart... although it's a case between Jimmy Stewart and Mr. Abend, it is not an issue solely between them, that this case will have far-reaching effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.377" offset="13055863">The vast majority of the renewal copyrights are owned by the children and the widows of authors who had films made based upon their books.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.806" offset="13165578">As I've noted, they're confusing the use of the film with the use of the new matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.738" offset="13749258">Well, that's the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.820" offset="13753542">But they are just additional copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.623" offset="13768797">I mean, there is no reason... if you're going to allow us to use the film, there's no reason to make us take one print around from each theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.939" offset="13798054">We have... it seems to me that it's reasonable that we have a right to make enough copies that they could be marketable in the way that the product is usually marketed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.156" offset="13846956">I would hope not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.817" offset="13849568">And certainly, that's not the... what Congress thought was a reasonable result in 1976, although I'm not by any means saying that what the Congress did in 1976 has to govern what is done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.985" offset="13898260">In fact I should point out that counsel is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.559" offset="13908500">In our brief, at page 41, we say that the fair-use issue is determined by the 1976 act because the conduct which gives rise to the fair use all occurred after 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.856" offset="13957715">But the renewal issue and the effect of the death of the original author and the renewal by the executor all took place before 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.174" offset="13991047">There's no way that the 1976 act could determine the effect of that 1970 renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.839" offset="14021662">And it's not reasonable to say that Mr. Woolrich didn't get fairly compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.053" offset="14042560">There's no record of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.154" offset="14046949">All that's in the record is that he sold five short stories to people who were willing to take a chance that they might use some of them in a film someday, and that he got a payment of $9,200, which in 1987 was worth something between $50,000 and $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.385" offset="14107867">It was entirely up to him whether or not he wanted to take that as a lump sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.488" offset="14124271">And for all we know, he put it in real estate and it came out better for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.920" offset="14142035">But it... I just... it's not reasonable to look backwards and try to second-guess what made Mr. Woolrich happy in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.385" offset="14171814">As far as the special expertise of the Registrar and Professor Nimmer, I want to point out that in 1960 the Registrar said that the... that she thought it looked like, in the case where a work... or the first term of copyright had expired by agreement, maybe you couldn't use that work any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.910" offset="14253943">And she cited it for that... the Ricordi case... not this Court's decision in Miller Music, which had come out earlier in the year, in which she cited Ellsworth throughout her study.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.798" offset="14289470">She relied, not at all, on the Miller Music case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.341" offset="14299710">And Professor Nimmer, who wrote the treatise on this, from 1963 to 1977 said not a word about Miller Music as being the guide in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.968" offset="14342133">He, too, relied on the Ricordi case, which Judge Friendly pointed out had nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.942" offset="14366061">And in fact the re-reading of the district court's decision in Ricordi will show that Paramount Pictures, in that case, who was... in the case of Mr. Abend, conceded that the owner of the opera had the right to continue performing the opera... had the right to grant new rights.</text>
