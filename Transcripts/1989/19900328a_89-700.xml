            <label>Mr. Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="21.996" offset="87980">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.650" offset="106580">I would like to start... in light of the discussion in the previous case, before turning to the specifics of the Astroline case, I would like to start with a little more discussion of the nature of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.362" offset="177424">The Communications Act is unique in our governmental system.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.481" offset="197904">It was essentially a structure invented by Herbert Hoover a long time ago, and it attempts to handle a dilemma of major proportions, which is the dilemma of the necessity of a licensing scheme for broadcast frequencies to avoid a total interference and total chaos, a licensing scheme which, since it goes over the whole country, must be federally applied, and the fact that the resulting broadcast activities have enormous First Amendment implications because the broadcasting industry is very, very significant agency for informing the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.817" offset="415242">And this has resulted in compromises, if you like, in treatment over the years that is different from other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.173" offset="448679">It is different from industries not so effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.791" offset="463099">It is different from the newspaper industry, which doesn't have a licensing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.362" offset="489430">So way back in NBC v. United States, this Court said that the FCC is not a mere traffic cop.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.968" offset="527778">It's concerned with the nature of the traffic, as well as its distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.407" offset="561528">This Court in Red Lion... excuse me... this Court in Red Lion upheld a very significant action by the Commission in requiring what was called the Fairness Doctrine, which meant in substance that if one side of a controversial issue was discussed, that it would be necessary to provide discussion of other viewpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.276" offset="677094">In other words, a diversity of viewpoints was imposed by the Commission and upheld by this Court in Red Lion.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.116" offset="712411">Of course, that can be called content control.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.984" offset="727876">It is not saying what position should be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.554" offset="746162">It is not a very precise or detailed form of content control, but it's a form of content control.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.779" offset="791092">It was mentioned earlier today, the Listeners Guild case, and with deference, I think it was not accurately described.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.183" offset="816692">The suggestion was that in the Listeners Guild case that this Court said that it is wonderful... not wonderful, it is appropriate for the Commission to leave entirely to the marketplace what goes out over the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.859" offset="879386">A closer examination of the Listeners Guild case will reveal that the subject of it was entertainment programming and that the Court, in upholding the Commission's decision to leave entertainment to the marketplace, was not dealing with the nonentertainment aspects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.622" offset="962456">Now, it's perfectly true that the Commission over the years and to some degree the Court over the years have gone up and down on the question of the degree of intrusiveness which is appropriate and permissible on the part of the Commission in order to carry out what one of the arguments this morning referred to as the trustee notion of broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.673" offset="1062661">It was suggested from the bench that what we are all in for is to make the maximum money and therefore the only test that will be applied by a broadcaster, regardless of origins, is to make the most money.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.468" offset="1137789">I would hope that there are other factors which enter into it, but be that as it may, I suggest that with the licensing necessity, and with the Communications Act and its structure having been upheld over the years, that the determination of that question is a question for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.632" offset="1226501">I think there has been unfortunately, today, because Congress isn't here except through an extremely impressive and comprehensive brief by the United States Senate... not a senator, but by the United States Senate... on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.776" offset="1295047">Because the Congress isn't here and the representative of the FCC is here, there is a tendency of the Court to treat this as an FCC matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.734" offset="1334857">It really, as the brief for the Senate shows and as Mr. Armstrong's argument made clear, it is not an FCC matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.257" offset="1372996">The FCC received large numbers of signals over the years that it should pay more attention to the composition of ownership of broadcast stations, and when the FCC adopted the policies that have been discussed this morning and then at a later time a differently composed Commission looked as though it was going to change those policies, Congress stepped in and very explicitly told it not to.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.626" offset="1694407">--Yes, and when we say equal protection component, we have to say component, because this Court, quite properly, read the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment into the Fifth Amendment, just as it has read the Amendments to the Bill of Rights into the Civil War Amendments, and just yesterday there was a jury trial... I'm sorry, an election spending requirement of a state that was subjected to analysis under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.815" offset="1835259">So I think it is one Constitution, now, and I think any notion that somehow or other the Congress has greater power in its own areas because of the Fourteenth Amendment, or needs to rely on the Fourteenth Amendment, I think is not well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.241" offset="1892937">I think that the Congress is functioning here... there has been a good deal of discussion this morning on the question of remedial, and I think some of the terminology gets confusing, or imprecise, as to what kind of remedial we mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.635" offset="2054478">And contrary to the suggestion that Congress just late some night did something in an Appropriations Act saying don't change your policies, contrary to that suggestion, in Congressional Reports and testimony and so forth before Congress, the focus has been very definitely on diversity and on remedial in the sense that, not that the FCC has discriminated, not that broadcasters have discriminated, but that as a result of society-wide discrimination, which we all know about and which this Court has mentioned in a variety of contexts, that at the beginning at least there was an extraordinarily small percentage of broadcast ownership by minorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.352" offset="7077407">In so doing the FCC affirmed what the minority distress sale basically says on its face, and that is that white people need not apply when the minority distress sale policy is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.891" offset="7323481">Well, Justice O'Connor, I have to say I've sat through four separate arguments, four separate presentations this morning to the court, and I think the one lesson that I've learned is that there is no basis for saying exactly what the FCC was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.400" offset="7377502">The FCC itself, as I believe you've noted in the last presentation, had specifically disclaimed here this morning that its minority ownership policies are remedial in nature, and we would tend to agree with that, although some of the briefs in this case have indicated that they believe there is some remedial component.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.529" offset="7446047">In any event, even if it were remedial and even if it could be said that there is some effort to correct remediation, it is not at all narrowly tailored to that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.551" offset="7486171">In other words, there's no showing... again, going back to what was shown in the application... all that was said is Mr. Ramirez is an Hispanic-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.907" offset="7515533">It doesn't say Mr. Ramirez is an Hispanic-American who has suffered discrimination, who has been the victim of any kind of disadvantage at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.910" offset="7543536">And the FCC policy specifically doesn't get into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.096" offset="7560359">In other words, it is not... even if it were remedial in nature... and we do not agree that it is... it is not at all narrowly tailored to correct remediation or, I'm sorry, to correct conceivable discrimination which has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.356" offset="7617411">Before I get into the substance of my argument I think it may be appropriate to... to discuss very briefly the standard of review because there has been a lot of discussion this morning, but not much directed to precisely what issues are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.532" offset="7670073">As I understand the standard of review with respect to race-based governmental classifications, it is incumbent upon the proponent of that classification, whether it's an agency, local government or even the federal government to come forward and explain what in compelling governmental interest the classification is directed to, and then to... to demonstrate that, in fact, the classification is narrowly tailored with a good degree of precision to achieve that compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.539" offset="7810090">That... that, at least, is my understanding of the strict scrutiny standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.657" offset="7822524">Now, in this case, as I just mentioned to Justice O'Connor, there appears to be some confusion as to exactly what compelling governmental interest is supposedly being advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.096" offset="7864320">And I think we can take as a given at least based on the Commission's presentation this morning that it is not remedial... a remedial purpose to... to correct past discrimination although I'm certainly happy to discuss that if anyone has questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.141" offset="7932552">Rather, what appears to be the Commission's position now is that it is... the distress sale policy in particularly in the minority ownership policies as a whole are directed to the advancement of program diversity, and that is the compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.501" offset="7989917">And the citation is to the First Amendment and the diversity of voices and a multiplicity of voices and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.721" offset="8018860">I want to say right off the top that Shurberg is not averse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.006" offset="8031922">We do not dispute the value or the desirability, especially in a democratic society of diversity of voices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.029" offset="8060029">A multiplicity of voices is clearly the way that our society has chosen to govern itself, and we support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.135" offset="8092526">Our problem is that race-based classifications are completely and utterly inappropriate and unnecessary for the advancement of that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.622" offset="8126485">There is absolutely no rational connection at all between the asserted goal and the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.776" offset="8147069">So from that point of view we would challenge the notion of... of... of program diversity as... as a valid compelling governmental interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.424" offset="11513626">Why is Alan Shurberg any less capable of increasing program diversity just because he is white, and why is Astroline any more capable of doing so just because it is... its supposedly controlling principal has a Spanish-sounding last name?</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.934" offset="11571722">And I think that... that presents that point as clearly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.104" offset="11596382">I would like to proceed to the second aspect of the strict scrutiny standard, which is the narrow tailoring, that even if it is accepted for the sake of argument, that the program diversity is a valid, compelling governmental interest sufficient to support race-based classifications, it still has to be... the program still has to be narrowly tailored to meet that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.085" offset="11676317">The distress sale policy is not narrowly tailored in any sense, meaningful or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.203" offset="11696797">The only requirement that needs to be... that is imposed on a minority distress sale applicant is that it is assert that it is minority controlled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.011" offset="11739951">The applicant does not have to show in his application what he expects to do or what he may do or what he'd like to do, and, in fact, as we've indicated in the... in our brief, the... what Astroline ultimately came up with in the way of programing in our view shows not a tremendous sensitivity to minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.674" offset="11818632">Secondly, there is no limit on the number of other stations that might be owned by the distress sale applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.893" offset="11839530">In other words, if I'm a distress sale applicant and I own 35 other stations, AM, FM and TV stations, I'm still qualified for an absolutely dispositive preference under the distress sale policy as against somebody who's white but doesn't own any stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.220" offset="11892820">This makes no sense as far as program diversity is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.303" offset="12513176">The FCC has not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.421" offset="12517669">To the contrary, over the last five years it has increased the number of stations that can be owned by any particular entity, almost doubling them from seven to 12, and in some situations as many as 14 can be owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.829" offset="12575242">That being the case, it would appear that the FCC is not as concerned about diversity as it would have the general public believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.344" offset="12665313">I would like to address very briefly the 3.5 percent figure, because I think it's an important one if the question of remediation arises at any point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.550" offset="12698122">Ms. Polivy during the Metro argument referenced the fact that only 3.5 percent of the broadcast stations in the country are owned by minorities, and this is asserted in some of the briefs as a basis for concluding there is an underrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.376" offset="12753502">I don't want the Court to go away thinking that that is in fact a valid assessment of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.411" offset="12773564">In fact, the congressional research study report indicates, I believe... and it's cited by the FCC in its own brief... that minority participation in the broadcast industry may be somewhere between 13 and 15 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.903" offset="12823510">The 2 to 3.5 percent figure which is so frequently cited by the various supporters of the policy relates only to those situations in which the minority person or people exercise what the FCC defines as control of the license, control being defined as 50 percent or more ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.217" offset="12896862">So that if a minority individual happened to own 49.9 percent of a chain of stations that amounted to 25, 35 stations, that ownership would not be reflected at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.486" offset="13121933">They both would have been turned down, because under the Commission's procedures, the time when the window opens for coming in against a renewal had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.877" offset="13175432">So that when, after the 1977 renewal of Faith Center, which was the old licensee, after the time for that had passed, it was too late for someone else to come in, and if Mr. Shurberg had come in then, which he didn't, and someone else had come in then who was black, they both would have been turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.142" offset="13268532">The Court below, while it found the Commission's distress sale unconstitutional... policy unconstitutional... I prefer to call it the congressional policy now, and in that regard I hope the Court will take the time to read the conference report on the '82 Act which is even more explicit than the Senate report that I was reading from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.842" offset="13359334">Congress knew what it was doing, it knew it was remediation for society-wide discrimination and because it thought it would help with programming.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.117" offset="13420460">I guess it's permissible for me to mention that in the last few days there was a story in the Washington newspapers about a conservative radio station where the personality made an invidious remark referring to an anchor person on one of the networks as "Connie Chink".</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.169" offset="13528607">It's barely possible that if an Oriental had owned that station, that that at least would either not have been done, or might not have been repeated, and it's even possible if a Hispanic owned the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.261" offset="13585032">It's also possible if a white owned the station.</text>
