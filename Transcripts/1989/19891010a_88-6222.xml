            <label>Mr. Paul R. Gettleman</label>
            <text syncTime="13.310" offset="189695">Thank you, Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.521" offset="198577">The issue before the Court in this case is does the mandatory language in the Pennsylvania death sentence... death penalty statute, prevent a sentencer from making an independent determination as to whether death's a appropriate sentence in a given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.490" offset="258450">In California v. Ramos, in a majority opinion written by Justice Connor, she approved a far-reaching inquiry into the countless facts and circumstances by a sentencing jury, and she indicated in that opinion that once an individual defendant becomes death eligible, then the jury can take into consideration a myriad of facts and circumstances which might warrant a sentence of less than death.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.070" offset="368686">In Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania legislature has unconstitutionally, in my opinion, limited the types of mitigation that a jury can consider in determining whether or not there is mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.710" offset="423334">For instance, Pennsylvania only allows a jury to consider extreme mental illness or substantial impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.527" offset="454577">But in this particular case, Mr. Blystone gave an extended confession to a police informant, and in that confession he alluded to things like, well, it was thrilling to kill somebody, and you really don't have to be a bad person to kill, and alluded to aspects of the person's brain coming out of his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.993" offset="536392">Now, a juror who heard all this might think that this individual is mentally ill to think like that, to have no regard at all for life, but might feel that under the definition of Pennsylvania's extreme mental illness, or substantial impairment, it wouldn't qualify, because he might feel extreme would be locked up in a mental institution or taking thorazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.411" offset="646107">And what happens is that he is not allowed to consider mental illness or substantial impairment in making a decision as to whether or not death is the appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.733" offset="703367">The Respondent had suggested that in the catchall, number 8, the jury could then consider whether or not an individual is simply mentally impaired or simply mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.622" offset="762926">But I think that... that analysis is incorrect for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.666" offset="779122">When the Pennsylvania legislature wrote this statute, they included a burden of proof, proof beyond a... proof beyond a preponderance of the evidence, that there is a mitigating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.165" offset="829068">So if the... the statute required proof beyond a preponderance of evidence that it--</text>

            <text syncTime="185.823" offset="879746">Proof by a preponderance of the evidence that an individual was severely mentally ill or extremely mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.361" offset="917885">If it could be picked up in this catchall, then that would destroy the burden of proof, because the jury would no longer have to find it by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.829" offset="959785">In addition, the language of the statute is any other factor, and a fair reading of the word other would probably mean other than the first seven factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.495" offset="1010463">So, a defendant in Pennsylvania would probably be left... a defendant in Pennsylvania who is just simply mentally ill, or whose judgment was just substantially impaired, would be left with a situation where the jury could not consider that, or give any weight to it, in making a determination as to whether or not death is the appropriate--</text>

            <text syncTime="253.631" offset="1151001">Before that catchall, it has a... a specific mitigating circumstance of extreme mental illness or a substantial impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.058" offset="1196663">Now, if a jury, in viewing all the evidence, goes down the list and determines that he wasn't extremely mentally ill, or severely emotionally impaired, he would set that aside, or she would set that aside, and go on down the list to see if it fit in any other category.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.962" offset="1280255">And I would suggest to Justice O'Connor that when they got down to the catchall, and it says any other evidence, a juror who was instructed probably wouldn't retrieve it back and conclude--</text>

            <text syncTime="301.702" offset="1343263">Don't you think that an attorney would argue on the basis of all of the mitigating evidence that came in, including whatever degree of mental impairment there might be?</text>

            <text syncTime="315.593" offset="1398851">--Well, it is for a jury to give whatever weight they consider to any particular factor, and it could well be that amongst the 12 they might consider something that would be mitigating which an attorney wouldn't have brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.531" offset="1454544">In this particular case, the closing... there was no mitigation presented by Mr. Blystone.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.437" offset="1478159">The closing argument by his counsel probably was a minute and a half to two minutes, because that was reflected upon one page of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.614" offset="1510864">And the basic plea was don't execute him.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.735" offset="1527374">There was no argument vis a vis mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.948" offset="1540226">And, as I also have suggested, I think a juror who was told that there was a certain burden of proof that had to be met wouldn't go back, after he couldn't meet that burden, to just apply it like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.229" offset="1597382">All the cases that the Court has talked about in terms of Lockett, Eddings, Jurek, they all suggested that a juror should be allowed to weigh whatever is mitigating and give whatever weight he feels it should have to make a determination as to whether or not that--</text>

            <text syncTime="423.609" offset="1830917">In Pennsylvania the situation is that if there is one aggravating and no mitigating circumstances, then the jury is instructed that they must return with the verdict of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.476" offset="1874384">In that particular case there is no weighing, as had just been suggested in the last argument, in North Carolina, as to the strength of the aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.455" offset="1918270">I think, in an opinion that you co-authored in Barclay, you had suggested that if the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating, but weren't so weighty as to require death, then the jury should be permitted to return with the verdict of life, because it wouldn't have been the appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.477" offset="1998414">Also, in North Carolina v. Smith, you had suggested again that there is almost a constitutional right for a jury to exercise its discretion and return with a verdict of life, even though there might be more aggravating than mitigating, when the strength of the aggravating is not such that would require the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.700" offset="2079289">In Pennsylvania, what happens is that if there are no mitigating circumstances, the jury is instructed that they must return with the verdict of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.947" offset="2112203">They have absolutely no discretion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.789" offset="2123592">And it seems to me that this falls under the same problem as Caldwell v. Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.044" offset="7064601">This is precisely why Pennsylvania's statute is in the center of all... of the spectrum of... of... of statutes that cover the landscape in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.639" offset="7103054">We're not in the extreme of unbridled discretion, as some of the statutes may be, or close to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.974" offset="7124370">Nor we are... nor are we in the other extreme, where a statute requires the finding of death on the simple finding of first degree capital murder without any consideration of mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.790" offset="7167628">This statute provides a fair balance of... of the competing interests that are involved here, of arbitrariness, and it encourages individualized sentencing, and it... and it... it makes the... jury's verdict one of appropriateness and rationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.451" offset="7234293">And when their final verdict is in, it's the kind of case in which speaks clearly that this is... this defendant deserves the death penalty because of the aggravating factors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.089" offset="7280791">They are proven beyond a reasonable doubt and there are no mitigating factors, or the aggravating outweighed the mitigating factors that had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.465" offset="7310361">I... I would... I would point out that the question before this Court is whether or not Pennsylvania statute is mandatory, and the Defendant again seems to walk away from it, even here at oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.471" offset="7354352">And... and I would suggest to the... to this Court, that the... that his argument on whether or not there is a sufficiency of weighing of the aggravating, or... that there is insufficient consideration of degrees of mitigating, has nothing to do with whether the statute is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.704" offset="7427286">If you took the "must" word out of the there, the word that says that the defendant... that the jury must find the... the... the defendant guilty... excuse me, must impose the death penalty after aggravating are found and no mitigating, or aggravating outweigh mitigating, if you took that word and put "may" in there, it... the problem would still be there, because it is a Lockett problem, it's an Eddings problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.822" offset="7579736">And this statute is not mandatory because it permits the jury to consider all relevant evidence in making a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.697" offset="7611292">Mitigating, as mitigating factors, just as this Court has required, Pennsylvania has spelled them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.222" offset="7637310">This statute came into being in 1978 after Lockett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.216" offset="7653297">Those factors are... are... are there because this Court has indicated to the states that... that juries need to be guided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.120" offset="7680987">We have taken the advice of this Court and the states have decided that this is the way that they have gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.145" offset="7701049">There are 14 states that have similar statutes like Pennsylvania's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.318" offset="7713692">They have structured the mitigating to give it content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.440" offset="7726231">They have... they added factors in there that permit mitigation to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.085" offset="7744830">In relation to the... the argument that the Defendant makes that... that they ought, we ought to weigh the sufficiency of the aggravating, I'll address that even though it's... I don't think it is relevant to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.793" offset="7791641">Because there is no... no case of this Court, neither does the Constitution require that we weigh the sufficiency of aggravating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.907" offset="7832079">For example, your Jurek case, this Court did not have a... a weighing process approved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.852" offset="7851828">There was none under the Texas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.025" offset="7860605">But... but the point to be made here is that Pennsylvania allows the circumstances of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.729" offset="7891325">And that's all this Court requires, and that the Constitution requires is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.774" offset="7907521">And the real question here is, does the jury get to look at the circumstances of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.242" offset="7941375">And in Pennsylvania statute, they are required to look at the circumstances of the offense as a mitigating factor, just as this Court has said in Lockett.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul R. Gettleman</label>
            <text syncTime="2745.124" offset="11116925">My rebuttal will be very brief, Judge... Mr. Chief Justice, and it would only be in response to just a couple of points that the Respondent made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.412" offset="11150152">The Respondent seems to suggest that it is all right for the jury to weigh the strength of the aggravation, but the way it is done is it comes in through the catchall mitigating situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.187" offset="11201248">In this particular case, before the trial judge charged the jury, he said to them that he was going to list everything that they could consider as mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.845" offset="11247850">And then he went down the list and he suggested all the factors, the seven specific factors and the one catchall factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.452" offset="11286303">But a jury would have no way of knowing that if they found a specific aggravating circumstance, a felony murder by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that they could then turn around and weigh that as a mitigating circumstance by a preponderance of the evidence under the mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.018" offset="11376582">There is no instruction whatsoever, and there is no way a jury could even have intuitively known that it was permissible for them to flip-flop on a particular aggravating circumstance, turn it into a mitigating circumstance, create a straw man and weigh the two against each other, and then come up with a... a determination as... as to whether an aggravating circumstance outweighed itself, or whether a mitigating circumstance outweighed itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.799" offset="11499671">Another thing that the Commonwealth had, or the Respondent had suggested, that it's all right for a jury in Pennsylvania to consider just mental illness or substantial impairment, that that can be considered under the catchall phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.651" offset="11571037">But, in a similar vein as California v. Brown, when the Court spoke about mere sympathy, well, you can't take out that word mere, and in Pennsylvania you can't take out the word other, as in other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.819" offset="11619730">And other factors would be other than the first seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.863" offset="11635926">And if a jury who was going to listen to its instructions felt that the... the severity of the illness wasn't extreme or wasn't substantial, then they would be precluded from what this Court has suggested that they have every right to do, in Lockett and Jurek and those other cases, is to consider any mitigating evidence and give it the weight that it believes it deserves in arriving at the formula as to whether one outweighs the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.242" offset="11741460">And in conclusion, I think this Court has alluded to, and has specifically said through Justice Stevens, that there is a constitutional right to have the defendant... have the jury weigh the weight or the strength of the aggravating circumstance, even if it is weighed against itself, to make a determination that that's the type and the strength of the kind of circumstance that would justify a death sentence as opposed to a lesser included sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.159" offset="11861101">If there are no other questions, I have none.</text>
