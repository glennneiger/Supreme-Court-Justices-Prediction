            <text syncTime="73.930" offset="442379">The issue in this capital case is what standard of review should a Federal habeas court apply in reviewing a state court's finding that an aggravating circumstance exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.320" offset="495878">It's our position that once the Federal habeas court has examined the aggravating circumstance and determined that the state court has adopted a proper narrowing construction of it, that the state court finding that the aggravating circumstance exists is not generally subject to Federal review.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.484" offset="572573">Only in those instances where the finding is so unprincipled or arbitrary as to somehow violate the Constitution should that finding be reviewed by a Federal habeas court.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.791" offset="617817">I suppose it would be reviewable under the Jackson against Virginia standard at... at any rate if it were argued that there were no... no juror could possibly or no court could possibly find him beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald R. Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="131.366" offset="672048">That's an additional standard that the dissent in the Ninth Circuit recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.436" offset="688348">It's also a standard we've mentioned in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.205" offset="703395">However, our one problem with that is that we do not, and this Court has not, equated aggravating circumstances with findings of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.144" offset="739235">The Jackson standard does apply to standard of guilts... findings of guilt, and for that reason we would prefer the standard stated in Barclay which is the... so unprincipled or arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.320" offset="799943">Briefly, in this case the Arizona trial court found two aggravating circumstances in Mr. Jeffers' case.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.074" offset="826902">He found that in committing the murder he created a grave risk of death to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.961" offset="846441">He also found that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.949" offset="874444">In the Arizona State Supreme Court's independent review of this case, it set aside the first aggravating circumstance, the grave risk of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.388" offset="908195">And with regard to the second, it set aside the cruelty portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.375" offset="924077">It found that cruelty had not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.011" offset="938706">It, however, affirmed the finding that he had committed the murder in an especially heinous and... and depraved fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.432" offset="976322">Mr. Jeffers then petitioned for cert. to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.801" offset="985831">Cert. was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.868" offset="990115">He then subsequently filed a Federal habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.038" offset="1006729">In that petition he made a number of attacks on his... on his sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.526" offset="1032746">Two of those attacks were that the cruel, heinous or depraved aggravating circumstance was void on its face, and, secondly, that it was void as applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.500" offset="1080603">The district court ruled against him on both.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.786" offset="1089798">He then went to the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit... with regard to the first question, the Ninth Circuit, relying on its prior decision in Chaney, found that the circumstance was not void on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.943" offset="1142356">It then went on to address the question he had presented, essentially that it was void as applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.281" offset="1171718">The Ninth Circuit concluded, after reviewing some Arizona cases, that the evidence presented did not meet Arizona's definition of cruel, heinous or depraved, the narrowing decision... the narrowing construction that they had previously found had been made by the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.677" offset="1245279">It's our position that what the Ninth Circuit essentially did, and what Respondent is asking this Court to do, is to allow Federal habeas courts to act as a third sentencer.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.673" offset="1841289">Our basic position is that since Furman this Court's consideration in death penalty cases has been that states should narrow the class of people eligible for the death penalty and that this Court... and that state courts should guide and minimize, but not eliminate, the discretion of the sentencing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.586" offset="1924985">The two main decisions that I think are relevant here from this Court are Godfrey and Maynard.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.692" offset="1957377">Neither of those support the action taken by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.894" offset="1970229">Neither of those dictate the result that the Respondent would like from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.065" offset="1994889">The problem in Godfrey and what caused this Court to reverse Godfrey's death sentence was not that this Court found that Godfrey's conduct was somehow less atrocious... I believe was the language in Godfrey... than that of other people in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.844" offset="2058000">The problem in Godfrey was that Georgia had adopted a narrowing construction of their aggravating circumstance, which is similar to Arizona's.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.032" offset="2094781">I believe they used the word atrocious rather than... than heinous and depraved.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.186" offset="2119336">This Court recognized that... that Georgia had done that, they had adopted a narrowing construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.888" offset="2138144">The problem with Godfrey, however, was that the jury who sentenced Mr. Godfrey was not instructed in accordance with that narrowing definition, and, therefore, their finding that the circumstance existed was subject to uncontrolled discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.485" offset="2212541">And, secondly, on review by the state supreme court of Georgia, the state supreme court also failed to apply their own narrowing construction of the aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.192" offset="2259352">Because of those two things, this Court concluded that the danger of excessive discretion in an unchanneled sentencing decision was too great and therefore reversed Mr. Godfrey's death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.702" offset="2317449">In Maynard, which followed Godfrey, the problem again was not... or, the reason for the holding was not that Mr. Maynard's conduct was somehow less atrocious or less heinous than that of anyone else in Oklahoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.331" offset="2695911">The only... the difference here is that the Federal court went beyond those questions, whether or not there is a definition, whether or not the definition is narrow, and whether or not the definition was applied by the state supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.840" offset="2757977">Those are the considerations that this Court talked about in Godfrey and Maynard.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.892" offset="2966226">It's our position that that final step, disagreeing with the result, is not a Federal question subject to review in habeas cases unless that finding is somehow so unprincipled or arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.787" offset="3041772">Respondent's position and, by extension, that taken by the Ninth Circuit, essentially would open almost every step of a state court's sentencing process in capital cases to Federal review.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.411" offset="3092240">There is no logical reason why Respondent's position and that taken by the Ninth Circuit could not be extended to allow a Federal habeas court to in effect find mitigation that the state court had rejected, to allow a Federal court to in effect find that mitigation, which the state court had found was insubstantial and insufficient, was substantial to call for a leniency, was indeed sufficiently substantial to call for a leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.014" offset="3202686">All of these things, the state would submit, are simply beyond the power of the Federal habeas court and are things that the Federal court should not be doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.024" offset="4498673">Getting back to the comments I made regarding this Court's general holding since Furman, the need for narrowing the class and restricting sentencing discretion in capital cases, I think if you examine the Arizona sentencing scheme, you'll see that Arizona has done just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.652" offset="4565233">First of all, Arizona provides for sentencing by a judge, rather than by a Jury, which this Court has noted on some occasions should provide for more consistent reasoned application of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.495" offset="4620613">Arizona also requires the sentencing judge to make written findings to file a special verdict so that the appellate court can review what it is that the... that the trial court based its death sentencing decision on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.672" offset="4677351">Arizona also requires that the aggravating circumstance which qualify a defendant for the death penalty must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.610" offset="4713086">Arizona further provides for automatic appeal in every death penalty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.312" offset="4727819">The Arizona Supreme Court conducts an independent review of the evidence concerning both aggravation and mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.983" offset="4758539">It does not defer to the trial court's finding; it makes its own decision as to whether or not the evidence is sufficient to meet the aggravating circumstance or the mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.774" offset="4797723">And, also, as a matter of state law, the Arizona Supreme Court conducts a proportionality review in which it compares the sentence imposed in the case before it with those in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.081" offset="4846937">That proportionality review is done as a matter of state law, and not as a matter of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.216" offset="4863447">As Pulley makes clear, one problem with that sort of proportionality review being done by a Federal court is that the Federal court... this Court or any other Federal court... is not going to have the same access to the record in the other death penalty cases from the state that the Arizona Supreme Court will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.745" offset="4933560">The Arizona Supreme Court will have those records before it, will have the transcripts, will have the sentencing decisions, and can make a much more informed and complete analysis than a Federal court could do attempting to make a proportionality review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.158" offset="5011300">With respect to what happened in this case, our position is that the standard applied is a constitutionally narrow one, that the facts fit plainly within that definition, and in fact fit within the core of that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.751" offset="5069605">It's our position that the Ninth Circuit, instead of acting as a Federal reviewing court, essentially acted as another sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.072" offset="5098862">In doing so, it exceeded its authority and this Court should correct the mistake, set aside that finding by the Ninth Circuit, and reinstate the death penalty for Mr. Jeffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.213" offset="5143480">Unless the Court has additional questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1274.364" offset="5244103">The issues in this case have narrowed considerably as a result of the briefing and particularly the argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.434" offset="5272315">It seems to me it is clear that both parties agree that there are two questions, constitutional questions, that the Court has to address in a case such a this one, and it's also clear that the parties agree on the standards that apply to both of those two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.194" offset="5331352">What they disagree about is the answer to the first of those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.264" offset="5351728">The first question is whether or not Arizona's definition... Arizona has a definition of its especially heinous and depraved aggravating circumstance that satisfied the Eighth Amendment rule of Furman versus Georgia, that it narrowed the class of death-eligible first-degree murderers on the basis of an objective principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.345" offset="5443992">That question entails an inquiry, as in both Godfrey and Maynard, into first whether or not the state has defined its aggravating circumstance in a constitutional manner, and, secondly, whether it has applied a constitutional definition in the particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.009" offset="5630611">That's exactly the ruling this Court made in Gregg, which was that the reason the statute isn't unconstitutional on its face is it is, as the Ninth Circuit said, capable of constitutional definition and application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.601" offset="5685050">The question it set aside was are we going to throw out the Arizona statute lock, stock and barrel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.822" offset="5705948">And it said no, we're going to see if in the definition of that statute and in the application of that statute it was rendered constitutional before we're going to throw the whole thing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.297" offset="5751819">And it concluded that it was not constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.582" offset="5768955">The state has said that that narrowing requirement is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.301" offset="5783793">In fact, the state began its argument by saying once the state has adopted a proper narrowing construction... that's the critical premise... then you go on to its second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.924" offset="5826320">Well, we are challenging that premise, and the reason we challenge that premise is that the state has never told us what the narrowing principle is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.947" offset="5866444">There is no statement of that in the state's briefs and the state did not make that statement during the course of its argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.236" offset="5895597">We don't know what that narrowing principle is, and it's the absence of that principle that renders the Arizona definition as applied in this case unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.760" offset="8585687">First of all, all the trial judge did here was to recite the words of the statute, heinous and depraved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.198" offset="8627378">Secondly, the only instructions that we can assume that the trial court used in this case were the instructions given to it by the Arizona Supreme Court in prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.423" offset="8672309">And the only explanation or definition that existed as of 1980 in Arizona as to what heinous and depraved meant was that the dictionary synonyms were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.731" offset="8725494">That was the only definition existing at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.033" offset="8738764">Those dictionary synonyms are that heinous is defined as grossly bad or shocking evil, and depraved is defined as marked by deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.340" offset="8784009">We know that those synonyms as a substitute do not constitutionally suffice because this Court held that they don't in Maynard because those same dictionary synonyms from Webster's Third International were read to the jury in the Maynard case at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.868" offset="8854121">So, the trial definition is precisely the same in both cases and it's constitutionally insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.391" offset="8884214">Then you get to the third step of both Godfrey and Maynard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.026" offset="8898738">And that step says look at the constitutionality of the definition that the state supreme court has used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.965" offset="8934474">And that's what I want to go immediately because it's the heart of the analysis here and that is the Gretzler definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.285" offset="8959760">Gretzler is cited in both of the briefs, all of the briefs, saying that's the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.670" offset="8981285">There's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.605" offset="8989017">And Gretzler begins... it's a five-step process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.641" offset="9001138">It begins by reciting once again the dictionary definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.628" offset="9021096">The next thing it does is to say there's some factors that we've looked at in the past in looking at whether those definitions are met, and it lists some factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.364" offset="9052129">They include such things as whether the violence in the case was gratuitous, whether there was relish, and whether the killing was senseless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.470" offset="9088492">Then, the third step of the process is the critical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.874" offset="9106151">The court states its standard at page 12 of Gretzler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.612" offset="9125063">And there it says that the court will reverse a finding that the crime was committed in an especially heinous or depraved manner only... quote... where the circumstance... or, where no circumstances, such as the specific factors discussed above, separate the crime from the norm of first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.108" offset="9215029">And the court has made clear, not only because it said it three times in Gretzler, but in numerous cases afterwards, that those five factors that it set out do not need to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.714" offset="9253481">You can find heinous and depraved if some factor beyond those five is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.451" offset="9272394">And, indeed, the Arizona Supreme Court in a number of cases has found heinous and depraved present without finding any of the Gretzler factors that were specifically mentioned because it's factors such as those that are critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.776" offset="9321713">It's also critical that those factors don't control the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.163" offset="9339267">What controls the outcome is whether looking at those factors and those definitions the court decides that there's something about the case that sets the crime apart from the norm of first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.387" offset="9392139">And that norm has never been defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.756" offset="9401648">So, therefore, there are a number of cases as well in which the Arizona Supreme Court has found the Gretzler factors present but nonetheless said that's not a heinous and depraved case because those factors or no other factors set it apart from the norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.949" offset="9462461">By the way, the court has used a number of alternative phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.336" offset="9480015">But they're all to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.220" offset="9487538">Elsewhere it has said that the case is heinous and depraved under the circumstance if it is more heinous or depraved than the usual first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.394" offset="9528185">Sometimes the phrase is that the case is... quote... particularly disturbing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.179" offset="9547306">Or, oftentimes it simply says the case has to be especially heinous or especially depraved and it underlines especially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.468" offset="9580534">The next step in the Gretzler procedure is to say, well, how are sentencers supposed to know whether the violence in a case is sufficiently gratuitous, for example, to suffice, or how are sentencers to go about identifying factors such as but in addition to the factors that Gretzler listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.180" offset="9651378">And it says very clearly the courts are to look and see whether there are any additional circumstances so as to set the crime apart from the usual or the norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.554" offset="9700802">It is clear in Arizona, as a result of Gretzler and as a result of all other cases, that the standard is you look at all of the factors, such as those listed in Gretzler, but not by any means limited to them... and the court has added since then about 20 additional factors... and you ask whether any of those factors, or something else in the case, adds up to something additional that makes this case especially bad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.605" offset="9905080">Gretzler was decided about three weeks before Mr. Jeffers' case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.974" offset="9922529">Gretzler is cited numerous times in Jeffers' case and his case follows the same protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.628" offset="9945099">First, it says look at the dictionary synonyms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.747" offset="9961609">Then it says you look at the various factors in the case, and it quotes about nine or ten such factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.917" offset="9986268">And it says that it finds that this case does satisfy the factor because there are... quote... additional circumstances that distinguished the murder from the usual or the norm of first-degree murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.160" offset="10035274">It applies the Gretzler standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.945" offset="10046350">Most importantly I think, for your purposes here... for our purposes, it goes at the very end of the discussion of heinous and depraved and it confronts Mr. Jeffers' argument under Godfrey that the Arizona definition was unconstitutional for lack of a narrowing construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.007" offset="10122627">And the court says we do have a narrowing construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.276" offset="10135689">That construction is... and this is how we satisfy the requirements of Godfrey... that construction is... and I quote... it says that the case has to be... has to stand apart from the norm and the killing has to be especially heinous and especially depraved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.737" offset="10205592">Again, the especially underlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.622" offset="10213115">So, again, it's clear that that same standard extracted from Gretzler was applied in Mr. Jeffers' case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.859" offset="10246030">That standard from Gretzler applied in Mr. Jeffers' case is unconstitutional because it is identical to the standard that Oklahoma used in the Maynard case, and it has the exact same two defects that this Court identified in the Maynard case in unanimously overturning the Oklahoma construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.910" offset="10346235">The first problem is that the standard used in Arizona is a totality of the circumstances approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.314" offset="10371835">There is no objective factor that must be present for the murder to satisfy the--</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.888" offset="10922183">First of all, we obviously have to take the Arizona Supreme Court at its word here, and its word is that it followed the Gretzler standard and it didn't rely on any one or two factors that are set.</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.621" offset="11029076">Those words don't have any more content than the words "heinous" and "depraved", and, therefore, even if you could have a case where there were just two factors and those factors would be enough, it couldn't be where those factors are equally as unconstitutional as heinous and depraved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.167" offset="11099293">The second and final point that I want to make here is really the point that Justice White suggested in his question, and that is that if you have a standard that uses a definitional strategy that says we're going to define, looking at this totality of the circumstances, a qualifying case... a heinous and depraved case... as one in which we look at it all and we say it's especially bad, this Court said quite clearly in Maynard that that kind of an approach is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.116" offset="11303049">If I might, it seems to me what the standard in Maynard is... is that you can't just have an adjective and an adverb.</text>

            <text syncTime="2869.985" offset="11626549">And this Court said you can't do that, you need to say what it is, what that factor is, or what those factors are that make it bad and that have that common sense core of meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.090" offset="11663016">And that common sense core doesn't exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.894" offset="11678167">Just to answer one of the questions that the... was raised in the first argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.131" offset="11707111">The Ninth Circuit did not conduct proportionality review in this case, and I don't think that proportionality review would be appropriate in a constitutional review of an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.439" offset="11752355">It was very clear about why it looked at those cases, and it looked at cases... and it's more than six... it quoted about 12 cases because it also looked at the ones that are discussed in Gretzler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.831" offset="11797912">And it said, we can't find the definition that Arizona has given to be constitutional on its face, but let's see if we can look at cases and extract from those cases a better definition, a definition that would save the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.590" offset="11856949">And that's why it looked at those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.042" offset="11866771">However, when it looked at those cases, it said, you cannot extract a definition from those cases that both saves the constitutionality of the standard by providing a principal means to separate death from life cases and that applies to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.152" offset="11935212">There's simply no definition that you could extract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.520" offset="11944720">So, it's not proportionality review at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.039" offset="11954751">It is simply a look to the cases to see if you can save an otherwise unconstitutional statute and definition by looking to the cases and finding in the application, as reflected in those cases, a definition that would be constitutional and would save the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.000" offset="12030611">But because the Court found that the line had not, as it put, been made clear... that line between a special and usual depravity, as it said... since that line hadn't been made clear in Mr. Jeffers' case and you couldn't find a line that applied from the other cases, you had to find that as applied in this case it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.831" offset="12109919">It seems to me then, in conclusion, that this case is controlled by both Godfrey and Maynard's use of Godfrey in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.554" offset="12156835">Arizona's construction of the especially heinous and depraved circumstance stands on exactly the same footing as Oklahoma's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.327" offset="12187973">It is open-ended and there is no common sense core of meaning to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.648" offset="12209184">For those reasons, Mr. Jeffers... the judgment of the court below should be affirmed, that Mr. Jeffers' death sentence is unconstitutional, both as the definition of that circumstance has been given in the definition, and as it was applied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.058" offset="12382846">Going back to the Ninth Circuit, there were two arguments raised by Respondent there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.879" offset="12402177">One, that (F)(6), the cruel, heinous or depraved aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague on its face.</text>
